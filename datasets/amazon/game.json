This literally has everything we will ever need.<br /><br />--Small case is a perfect fit, is solid, and has lots of storage.  My wife is very happy with this.<br />--Rubber grips feel nice, BUT they're too big to use with the charger.<br />--\"Pro Grips / Wheels\" --  The little plastic control holders are nice.  Makes it easier to use them for two player games.  Almost as large as an old NES controller.  Decent quality, too.<br />--Plastic game case - VERY nice.  Will definitely be using this when we get some more games.<br />--Stand - It's a stand.  It's better than the little fold-out piece on the back of the Switch.<br />--Charger - Now this is nice.  Cable is long enough to reach behind the TV to the outlet.  Holds four joycons and charges them.  Really works well.<br />--Headphones - Meh.  They're good for a kid, no doubt.  Nothing to write home about. Haha<br />--Grip Case - LOVE THIS.  The grip case not only looks cool but it also makes the Switch much more comfortable to hold as an on-the-go gaming system.  Probably the best thing in the whole pack.<br /><br />All around a great set of accessories for the price.  We are getting a lot of use out of it already.  Saved a bunch of money over buying the pieces we wanted individually, too.  Great.",

            "question": "title: E-YOOSO Mechanical Keyboard, Outemu Blue Switches\ntext: I’m not an expert on mechanical keyboards (that’s a rabbithole I don’t want to go down, or I’ll be building my own in a week), but I do love them now that I’ve switched to using one on a daily basis. My daily driver is a HyperX Alloy Elite with Cherry MX Blue switches.<br /><br />I’ve put this E-YOOSO mechanical keyboard to the test for about three weeks. The switches are Outemu Blue Switches, which is a knock-off of Cherry MX Blue switches. I definitely noticed a difference between the Outemu and the Cherry. The Outemu are a little noisier and don’t feel as smooth. I feel more resistance when I type on the E-YOOSO keyboard versus the HyperX one. Over a few hours, the resistance adds up.<br /><br />Of course, the HyperX keyboard is more than double the price of this one, but the E-YOOSO is lacking in some basic features that I’ve become used to. There’s no attached wrist rest, and I really feel the lack of it. Muscle memory keeps my wrists up as if there was a rest under them, which gets tiring. There are no multimedia or sound controls on the keyboard; I really miss that easy adjustment when I’m mid game. The keycaps are basic plastic, without any texture. What you’d find on a normal cheap keyboard, and again, this is a matter of preference, but the keys are slippery. Not great for gaming.<br /><br />The silver screws on the keyboard continually catch my eye. This is a minor thing, but I wish the screws were flush with the plastic case rather than sitting above it. I’ve snagged my fingers on the screws a few times. The USB cable is plastic instead of braided.<br /><br />The lighting options are preset, you can cycle through them via the FN and INS keys. I do like that the keyboard includes options without needing to download additional software, but for most people, the first mode (steady rainbow) will be the default. If I’m gaming in the dark, marquee or snake are useless. Another minor quibble, but I really don’t like the orange row of the keyboard, I wish another color had been chosen. The orange just doesn’t fit with the other colors, in my opinion. It’s too similar to the red row right above it.<br /><br />I do like the dust resistance; I’ve had the keyboard sitting out for three weeks and haven’t noticed any dust building up on it.",

The problem I'm encountering it that it starts me from the very first challenge every time even though I've gone through and completed the first five.  I have trouble with Buckethead (the fifth challenge on the first show), but I did get through it the last time I played.  Unfortunately, when I started the game up again, I had to start back at challenge one.  If anyone out there knows how to get around that, please let me know.  The instructions clearly say that you start from where you left off and the game says it's saving throughout the play, but it still shows that I've done zero challenges.<br /><br />Other than that, though, it's a blast.  Enough movement to be fun, but not work up a sweat.  Better than watching TV in the evening.  So far I've gone through five games and loved them.  I just wish I could start at the point I left off because these games are getting a little boring and I have no way of playing the others except for training.<br /><br />All in all, though, I would recommend this for anyone who liked Minute to Win It on TV.",

It's not short and it's fun to see how the makers turned wonderland into this mad hellish place because of Alice's bad mental state. The monsters are creepy and the world of wonderland is well designed. I find the whole game very interesting and the gameplay itself is pretty fun. Each part of wonderland is very different and you have different weapons to choose from to mix up your fighting style. Though it's a hack'n slash I didn't feel that it was at all repetitive because of how unique every chapter was and all the new creatures you have to fight in each area.

The games are stored in memory in the headset itself, and capacity isn't upgradeable. Keep that in mind when you are making a decision between the 64 and 128GB model.<br /><br />Setup is easy. You will need a phone to download and use the app for setup and to get games. Then follow the instructions and in minutes you're ready to play.<br /><br />Graphics aren't going to rival PC or console games---they're a little bit retro in terms of resolution, but that kind of comes with the territory and the small built-in screens in the headset. Besides, that might be a good thing when it comes to VR. If the the graphics are too good, things might get a little \"uncanny valley\" and not so fun to play for long. That's not a complaint, just a personal opinion.<br /><br />The wirelessness is a huge convenience during gameplay---you won't feel a cord brushing against your arms or running down your back. And the controllers are responsive with no noticeable lag. Battery life is good enough for a several-hours-long gaming session.<br /><br />Game availability is coming around, but isn't really vast yet.

            "question": "title: A Very Decent Mechanical Keyboard\ntext: I am not a gamer. I ordered this keyboard mostly because I prefer using mechanical keyboards for typing, especially ones that have the old school IBM type keyboard feel. One of the distinct features of IBM style mechanical keyboards is the clicking sound that they make which is absent with this model. Honestly, the clicking noise does not add anything to how well the product works. It's just something I mainly enjoy out of nostalgia, so I'm not going to deduct any points for the quietness of the product.<br /><br />Fortunately, this is still a high quality mechanical keyboard with a number of useful features including USB port passthrough. The product is extremely well built with high quality parts and is weighted heavily enough so that it does not move around that easily. When it comes to keyboards the heavier the better so far as I am concerned. Keyboards that are so light that they feel like they are made out of cardboard are usually the lowest quality ones.<br /><br />The keyboard is extremely responsive and is more than adequate for day to day use. I can't really say how well it acts as a gaming keyboard, but for my purposes it works excellently. I will say that the price is a bit high compared to similar models made by other brands. Dell has been cashing in on the Alienware brand name ever since they acquired the company and sells everything with the name at a premium price. There are definitely better keyboards out there for the same amount of money (or less) though.",

            "question": "title: What a Blast!!\ntext: For perspective, I am an \"accoustic\" guitar player (mid-range \"Taylor,\" without electronics).  Slow to adopt new technology, I finally purchased a Wii console for my family this Christmas.  So we would be ready to go as soon as the wrapping paper was ripped away, I also had \"Wii Fit with Balance Board\" on hand, as well as a copy of \"Guitar Hero III\" to use with the \"Logitech Wii Wireless Guitar Controller.\"  Basically, the entire family has been playing Wii for most of the last 48 hours, and \"Guitar Hero\" for most of the last day.  I will incorporate comments from my daughter who has never played guitar, as well as from my son who plays electric guitar and has used other guitar controllers and is more accomplished with the games. (He plays most often at the \"Hard\" level, with occasional strolls into \"Expert.\")<br /><br />My controller started right up right away the first time without any problems.  Its easy to set up using the Wii controller that comes with the basic console.  If you are reading this review, its because you want a high quality experience, so you want your guitar to look and feel like the real thing.  Hard wood maple neck.  Dark rosewood fretboard.  Mother of pearl-like \"Logitech\" logo on the lower neck.  Chrome throughout.  It is a very realistic, high quality.  If you want the plastic \"toy,\" for your six year old, I suggest getting something cheaper and smaller.  It was a very sweet moment, taking this beast out of the box.<br /><br />I commented to my son that the neck might be slighly shorter than an actual electric guitar, but he said that this controller (entire unit is almost 34\" top to bottom) actually has a longer neck than most typical Guitar Hero controllers!  For folks who have never played guitar, or are familiar with the \"el-cheapo\" plastic devices, and people with smaller hands, you will notice that one of the costs of realism is that it may be more difficult for you to get your fingers around the neck.  But the five buttons and slide are easy to get used to.  Even my daughter (5' 4\" - never played before, but with good hand eye coordination) was able to work the neck with her left hand with no problem.  (We are all right handed.  I don't know what the options are for you lefties out there....If you don't mind the location of the \"whammy\" bar, I guess you just flip it upside down.)  You will need the strap that comes with it, because it weighs alot just like the real thing.<br /><br />The traditional black picking area over the glossy white is very classy.  It is shiny, hefty, and totally cool.  This is the kind of gift you want to get your child to guarantee a \"wow\" moment when it comes out of the box.<br /><br />My son thought the strum bar was a little longer than he'd seen in other controllers (almost 3 1/2 inches long), which allows plenty of freedom to move the right hand all over the place, and still have some bar to work with.  I suggested he learn to strum with up and down motion to prepare for the lightning fast songs, but he is still getting great speed with the Logitech strum bar just strumming as fast as he can with a downward motion, and its relatively quiet.<br /><br />The buttons work nicely.  My son assured me any issues I was having were due to me, not the mechanics of the buttons.  And I think he calibrated the timing of the \"notes\" for a little earlier strumming (using the Guitar Hero software) than I would have preferred.  Nevertheless, I'd say the buttons work just fine.  Logitech's write-up on the Amazon website is spot on, except perhaps for the sounds the buttons make.  Again, it was probably me - my son was playing more difficult songs, and making fewer clicks.  But I personally have no problem with sounds coming from the buttons. Just like I have no problem with the sounds my fingers make travelling up and down the base strings on my accoustic Taylor.  This may be the software more than the controller, but I like the fact that when you mess up big time, the controller emits a gentle twang; nothing too harsh.<br /><br />This product is consistent with other Logitech products I've reveiwed in the past.  If you take care of them, fidelity is never an issue.<br /><br />I've got to tell you, for this accoustic player, hitting a few hundred \"notes\" in a row, tilting the neck up to the sky to activate the bonus and feeling the vibration, fooling around with the \"whammy\" bar, etc., is hella fun.  The star power button is disguised as the pickups, and the \"+\" button is the bridge.  Basically, with the styling and color of this guitar, a little more practice, and a little less shaving, (I already wear glasses), I'll be an Eric Clapton look alike!<br /><br />And thats what its all about people.",

            "question": "title: Love my PS5, it's worthy of the hype!\ntext: Ignore all the low ratings from non-verified buyers. Stock was incredibly low and these consoles were near impossible to get.  People are rating out of rage instead of merit.<br /><br />I was lucky enough to score a Playstation 5 from Amazon on release day. I LOVE YOU AMAZON!!<br /><br />This system is a beautiful masterpiece. Everything is cleaners and smoother AND OH SO MUCH FASTER than the PS4. Games have NO load times. Example CoD Cold War to load a single player match of zombie mode took nearly 2 minutes for the PS4 version to load on my PS4 Pro. The PS5 version repeating the same process is literally 2.4  seconds to be ready to play. Even downloading games from PSN is much much faster.<br /><br />The only negative comment I can honestly make about the PS5 is the hard drive size. The wanted to make the system affordable and large SSD hard drives are very expense so they kept it under 1TB. As SSD prices fall in the future hopefully they release larger drives. PS4 games CAN be played now from external if you like. I installed multiple PS5 games and my most played PS4 and still have 200GB free so it's fine for the near future before juggling games becomes a thing.<br /><br />Currently 30 hours into Demon's Souls and so glad Amazon had stock on launch day!",

Should be included with vive itself.\ntext: Very nice bump protectors, seems these could protect even tougher &#34;crashes&#34; yet its not really to protect the wands, rather the objects that are surrounding them while in play even though I make it sound otherwise further on. After having the HMD protector on to protect it from the wands, I realized that the controllers need this more than HMD. Fits just right. Cutouts are perfect, even for the lanyard. Highly recommended for the discounted price only as I still stand just like with the review for HMD glove, 20 bucks is too much for couple silicone molds. Considering manufacturing costs, it is extremely high. Thus the color match with the hmd is not there, I dont care, I dont see them while playing. The grip is now somewhat softer while side buttons along with the menu button press easier as well, sides to press and menu to feel and press is way improved, its like with those phones that are too hard to press comfortably, with the silicone slip on skins, the buttons are suddenly so easy to press- if you know what I mean, then thats exactly what happens here with the Vive wand gloves which is only great and only for that matter itself, it should be included with Vive itself.",

            "question": "title: order this mouse new, stay away from the refurb\ntext: I ordered this because I am a longtime fan of Logitech products (20yrs+) I have purchased Logitech refurbished items in the past and they always looked and functioned like brand new. I bought this mouse mainly to play Quakelive. My old logitech mouse finally quit after 18yrs. (wingman gaming mouse) The first mouse I received looked brand new. I like this mouse. it feels good, its very precise, my aim is better with it,  but mid game it started changing settings on me on its own. I researched it, set up the software, unbound all buttons I wasn't using, made only one profile and deleted the rest, tried onboard memory and auto game detection,tried everything to be tried but nothing would stop it from changing settings on me mid game. I spent 2 days trying to get it to work, but determined it must be defective. I shouldn't have to spend 2 days and disable all other buttons and functions to get a mouse to work right in game. So I did a RMA with Amazon and asked for a replacement. My replacement came very quickly, and it was not in new condition. It was disgustingly filthy and I spent 10 minutes cleaning it. then I plugged it in and the left click does not even work. it is stuck down and doesn't click. The white box both mice (mouses?) came in say &#34;Logitech Certified&#34; refurbished. In my experience I've purchased dozens of refurbished items and they always look and function like new. I don't know how a company with Logitech's reputation for quality can certify a mouse that the left button doesn't even work on and is filthy dirty. I have already proceeded with RMA's for a full refund, and I ordered a brand new one for $20 more. Its a good mouse but I would not recommend buying the refurbished. spend the extra, buy it new and save yourself the headache.Amazon's customer service as always has been great.",

I'm not a hater on CoD or Battlefield.<br /><br />The thing is with MW3.. It's really just MW2.... nothing changed really with the menu, nothing changed with the guns, nothing changed with the graphics really, nothing changed with the sound effects. It is all the same!!! If you can remember the sound effects of the flashbang and concussion bang and frag grenade dropping, it will ring to your ear as MW2.<br /><br />It's boring kind of. I was playing it and I felt like I was playing Modern Warfare 2 just with different maps and kill streak settings.<br /><br />Modern Warfare 3... you are fun. but you aren't new. It's still the same. I think the Modern Warfare era needs to come to an end after this one or the next one.... and I hope if they do make a 4th MW... it's no where near the same as these last 3. If Call of Duty does continue... please make some kind of Colonial game or go back into history of the Civil War, try something new?

It is definitely better than the vanilla chat headset the comes with the xBox One, but not as good as my other stereo headset by Turtle Beach. The sound in the ear is pretty good. I like the &#34;open&#34; ear feature that allows me to hear my family when they try to talk to me. The part that I'm not as happy with is the mic and the cord. The sound quality of the mic isn't as good as the stereo headset. My chat friends notice a difference when I switch and say they can't hear me as well with this one.The other problem is the cord.  I've owned this headset for less than 3 months, and the cord has frayed and is breaking at the base of the connector to the controller. Where the plug-in becomes wire gets pinched against me when I hold it. It can't be avoided, therefore it is breaking. I wish the connector was a 90 degree plug-in that I've seen on other headsets.

Should include positioning tape.\ntext: I got this to give to my mom for Christmas to go with her Nintendo switch light that I bought her as well. Thankfully I decided to put one on my own switch and then put a screen protector on hers rather than just give her the package. Because she’s never put a screen protector on anything and I know she would’ve had no idea how to do it.  There are no instructions whatsoever in the box. Many times manufactures just stick a piece of paper in there with a link to a YouTube video to explain how to do it, but there wasn’t anything like that either. I’ve done screensavers on phones and iPads and digital cameras and stuff before so I know how to do it. but not everybody does. Missing from the package were the positioning tapes that most glass screen savers use to make it easier to apply the screen in the correct place. I used washi tape I had laying around. Also, they had a little sticker that said some thing about this being the back. I pulled that little tiny sticker off and the protective film on the back did not come off. I stuck the little sticker to the box to get it out of my way and then realized that you were intended to stick it on another portion of the protective film on the back of the screen protector and then it would stick and you could remove it. I do not understand why they did that that way and with no instructions, you were left to figure it out for yourself. The screen protector itself is nice. Once I got it on I had no bubbles, I don’t even know it’s there, it doesn’t seem to interfere with the touchscreen, and it seems to be good quality. But the lack of instructions and other issues make me unable to recommend it.",

Fortunately, I was able to return it for a full refund and bought it from OfficeMax at a much lower price.<br /><br />Since there are a lot of reviews out there, I'll make this quick:<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Clear sound.<br />* Works as intended.<br />* The mute LED is super useful.<br /><br />Indifferent:<br />* Will pair to multiple bluetooth sources, as long as you manually disconnect and connect it at the sources.<br />* Bluetooth volume is adjusted by clicking the volume button down and going through the menu.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* The headset will automatically disconnect from the PC, but will not reconnect without turning the headset off and on again, while bluetooth has no auto-disconnect/off feature. There may be a way to reactivate the connection to PC because the headset never really turns off, as it'll make the powerdown sound if I actually turn the headset off. I'll have to find out if I'm just using this feature incorrectly.<br />* I get some distortion/buzzing with bass in certain circumstances, notably when watching some YouTube content, but fiddling with the equalizer seems to mitigate this.<br />* Range isn't as good as I was expecting, and bluetooth doesn't always make a solid connection when reconnecting, as my coworkers said that I sounded like a robot when I left the room and came back.<br />* If you wear these around your neck, be prepared for them to be uncomfortably snug, and the mute button to turn on and off while it rubs against your chest.<br />* I was expecting deeper bass, but it performs decently well.<br />* Battery life isn't the greatest in comparison to newer stuff out there, and the battery saving options are almost non-existent.<br /><br />I haven't read the manual and only had to go online for a couple things I couldn't figure out, but it has been working great so far. It's a great headset, although I'd prefer better battery life while also foregoing the swapping battery \"feature\". I bought this headset for work and play, pairing to my work laptop via bluetooth and my gaming laptop via the dock.<br /><br />I've found that the audio options in the GG application are a bit different between Windows and Mac. On Mac, you only get an equalizer with presets, volume limiter, live mic preview, and mic sidetone adjustment. On Windows, you 'also' get DTS 7.1 surround, surround profile, stereo profile, bass enhancement, and dialogue enhancement. I suspect this is due to licensing, and to be honest, I these extras don't do a whole lot, IMHO.",

She had about 40 games, all the old favorites like Zelda, but none of them caught my attention till I tried Final Fantasy.<br />It is a rich, multi-layered game that's extremely straightforward. There are few puzzles (I hate them, so that's good), few mazes, and few trials that are overly difficult. It's a straight hack-and-slash game -- go kill things, go through this new level and kill things there, get objects, find the big bad guy and kill him too at the end. Basically, if you're persistent, you'll figure it all out. And there's none of that irritating \"ensemble cast\" design that the later FFs seem to like. As simple as the game design is, it still manages to tell a rich and involving story that actually, considering this is a Japanese game, makes sense. It took me a month or so to beat the game, and I immediately made another party and set out again at level 1, it's so good.<br />Since then, my mother's given me her SNES too, and I think some other system that involves CDs, but I still play Final Fantasy almost exclusively and still love it. If you actually manage to find this game, and you're a puzzle-hater like me, then I think you'll like it.",

This review is based on playing the version for the Switch.)<br /><br />CTR was the first game I ever 100%'d. Even for years after, I tried my darnedest to unlock Nitros Oxide, refusing to believe all the confirmations out there that he just wasn't unlockable. My sisters, dad, and cousins would play this game non-stop for months. I still have my original copy, and purchased it on PSN for my PS3 and PSP. This is the only game I have to get on all possible systems (besides Plants vs. Zombies). So I was pretty freakin' ecstatic when they announced a remake.<br /><br />First, the loading times. They are awful. I was talking to a co-worker about the game this morning and he said he was reading reviews that the game was great but that they mentioned the long loading times. I didn't believe it, but I was wrong. They occur when you load up races, and at the beginning of the story mode. They sort of kill the enthusiasm. I had heard that they're not that bad on other systems, but on the Switch it takes anywhere from 30 seconds to a minute before every track. Definitely needs to get fixed. I can see myself bringing this to friends' houses only for the loading to create a buzzkill.<br /><br />Once you get past them, though, you can actually play. And here's my other biggest problem: the hopping. I can't play CTR without the boosts. I've played MK8D and TSR and I'm always drifting and boosting, and it's all thanks to CTR when I played starting 20 years ago. I don't know what it is, but the jumping doesn't feel the same this time. Either the jumps are too high or they're too long, but they're definitely floaty. I'm actually able to change the direction mid-air, which I don't recall doing. I played the original to confirm, and the jumps definitely are slightly longer/higher here than in the original. In the original, the characters feel a wee bit heavier, which is far better for power sliding.<br />Subsequently, I'm not able to time and complete my boosts as I was before. I really hope I'm wrong and it's just me being a bit rusty, but if it's not the same then I'm going to have to change the way I play this game.<br /><br />Now, as for the positives, I love the extra content they added without really detracting from the overall experience. The visuals are beautiful, and they've added things here and there to the tracks without really changing them (e.g., Coco's track has a statue of Coco, Crash Cove has a sculpt of Crash, etc.). I played CNK back when it released, but don't really remember it. I really like that they added the CNK tracks and the other character; there were a couple of CNK tracks I remember but the characters I don't recall at all. Still, a nice touch.<br /><br />The customization really worried me when they announced it, as I had thought it would change the driving mechanics, but not so. In kart racers like MK, there are way too many customizations and I can never find one that feels right (and by right I mean one that drives like CTR). Here, the customizations are purely cosmetic, which I more than welcome. Each driver is the same from the previous iteration, and the little changes to the character and kart are just for show.<br />Thank goodness.<br /><br />Here's hoping Activision/Beenox updates the loading times for the Switch and, if necessary, the jumps. Right now, the jumps need to be either lower or shorter.",

She was a good Christian woman who took Trevor to church all day Sunday, to black church, to white church and mixed church. During the week prayer meetings and bible study. She was a good woman that wanted the best for Noah. She spoke English, Afrikaans, Zulu, Xhosa and German. Speaking all those languages helped her navigate through life and get a secretary job.

The only issue I ran into during my use of this item was that once the re-bindable macro keys were altered, I was unable to revert them into the original \"F\" keys they began. The instructions were difficult to fully understand. I am uncertain if it was due to translation difficulties or a lack of space on the small pamphlet.<br /><br />RedThunder One-Handed Mechanical Gaming Keyboard allowed me to conserve space on my desk. The keyboard is a good starting point for any gamer interested in an mechanical keyboard that does not want to commit to the higher price for a full keyboard.<br /><br />With small rubber-like feet to help keep it in place and the light weight design the product can help on-the-go laptop users. The keyboard had built in anti-ghosting, so you would not drop keys when pressing multiples at the same time. This will allow more hectic game-play without dropped inputs. The half of the keyboard you get with this covers most basic PC games (most First person shooters), but may leave you lacking for games which expect a full range (such as Smite or a multitude of strategy games).<br /><br />A small card that came with the keyboard from the creator pressing for those with issues to reach out to the makers and those with positive opinions to share their opinion. The website advertised by the production company was mostly not useful as I was unable to find anything of great use and there was a number of translation errors on the physical box [example: \"Fast eating chicken stability with many key no conflict reaction\"].<br /><br />Overall, I find RedThunder One-Handed Mechanical Gaming Keyboard is a good product. It's ideal for someone who is looking to reduce their wear and tear on a laptop, shared keyboard, an addition to their portable/space sensitive options, or anyone wanting to dip their toes into a mechanical keyboard.<br /><br />Of note: the box does not mention support for windows 10. They keys are click-y and the extra volume can be jarring for those whom live in close quarters.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review. I hope you have found it helpful and informative.",

            "question": "title: Fun update of NES Track & Field\ntext: Some people apparently find it difficult to use the controls.  I did not have this trouble, although a few of the events had a minor learning curve (3-5 tries to get decent at them), but nothing frustrating.  Even my 3 year old was able to play many of the minigames (in fact, he was better than me at the triple jump haha).<br /><br />Several reviewers said their arms hurt from playing this (because running  requires you to move the nunchuck and wiimote back and forth).  This was true for me at first, but then after messing around a bit I realized that you don't have to forcefully move them to run fast. You can use small, quick, gentler motions to get to a good speed.  My 3 year old doesn't get to full speed, but he consistently gets the blue signal that he's running fast...and he does not even hold them right.  Don't get me wrong; you definitely get a very minor workout and will probably sweat a little :)<br /><br />Several of those lower rated reviews also compare this to Mario Party, which is a bad comparison in my opinion.  This game certainly is not trying to be Mario Party.  This game is more like an updated NES track and field with Wii Controls.<br /><br />The only negative I have is the misleading Wi-Fi tag.  You cannot actually play others online, which is what I assumed.  You can upload your records and see how your records rank against the world which is nice, but online play would have been fun.<br /><br />I enjoy the \"Circuit\" mode which makes you compete in 4 events against the computer.  Winning these adds trophies to your collection, opens more circuits, and opens more Olympic events.<br /><br />I also enjoy the Mission mode where you have to take finish meet certain goals for 6 different events.  I have not completed one with all 6 yet as I still have to open up a couple of minigames.  It'll be fun trying to complete the goals for every character.<br /><br />One of the low reviews also mentioned that there was no replay value.  This is hard to comprehend since I have found a ton of replay value.  Trying to master the events, set world records, rank higher than online records, completing circuits to open up new events/circuits, and mission mode are extremely fun and you are replaying events over and over.  Not to mention getting family or friends to play with you so that you can compete against each other.<br /><br />My favorite events so far are: Trampoline, Skeet Shooting, Javaline, Hammer Throw, and rowing (scully or something).  I like the running events, especially the 400 meters where you have to focus on the character's stamina to keep him from slowing down due to being tired.  Archery is fun.  I have the most difficulty with table tennis, long jump,  and triple jump (the jumping events my 3 year old can beat me at heh).<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoy this game.  Online play would have put this over the top for a 5 star rating, but there is a lot to do without online play.  I too am a Mario Party fan (I give Mario Party 8 four stars also).  Don't expect this to be Mario Party, but a sporting event at the Olympics and enjoy!",

You basically roam around areas, fighting groups of demons, and try to recruit and fuse them to get more powerful demons to aid you. You can talk to demons to get items and recruit them but they might also ask for things from you or attack outright.<br /><br />This series, unlike Persona, is centered around grinding more than story.  I find it to be quite boring, actually.  You need to grind to find collectibles, grind for XP, grind to get items, and grind to fuse and level demons. It's just grinding.  The story is forgettable and trite.<br /><br />I got this game and played it for about 10 hours total. Then set it aside and will probably sell it. It's like the other entries in the series; if you love a boring grindfest, you'll really like this one because the mechanics are set up well.

It wasn't expensive and I was beginning to feel a bit discouraged with a lack of weight loss(although a ton of muscle gain). I have done maybe 4 workouts with this game so far and I love it!!! It is much more upbeat and fast paced then TBL game which was really nice. You sweat [...] with my fitness coach and are suprised when you look at how much time has passes. Also this game gives you a timer of how much workout time is left total, shows the workouts that are next and a bar passes showing how much longer you will be doing that workout. the setup was fun and extensive as well as the original fitness test. The moves seem a bit silly at first, even simple, but your arms will start killing you from lifting them up in every routine and you know you are getting a good workout. I use my heartrate monitor with this game and burn about 300 calories in a 30min workout, opposed to the 100 it tells me on the game. I encourage people to try the 30 min to start as it goes by really fast and you get a great workout while having fun. I have noticed a profound difference in just using this a few days, it was a good switch up from what I had been doing and I like it better. I can already see my waist is smaller than right before I started with thisgame and am excited to see the difference in another week. I HIGHLY reccommend.",

The hinges on the 'pages' operate smoothly, and the case closes with a rather satisfying click. 3DS and DS games alike snap in securely. There are two spots for SD and/or MicroSD cards as well, I haven't tried these. It appears that a MicroSD card would fit behind an SD card in that slot, so theoretically I think you could put two of each in this case. I'd probably prefer just another game slot there, as I don't really swap out the Micro SD card in my 3DS, but it's not a big deal. All in all, for the price this is a pretty nice little case.",

If you catch it quickly enough you can buy the token, but sometimes you can't use it when you go into free play mode.

It feels good in the hands, operates flawlessly via wireless connection, and uses 2 AA batteries (mine are rechargeable, which helps a lot ... I always recommend rechargeable batteries for game controllers). I can sit far away from the TV and still play without a problem. Having no wires is great because there is no tripping or tangling going on.<br /><br />Btw, I should add that I am very picky about my controllers. I have had several bad controllers in the past (e.g. buttons that stick, buttons that you have to press really hard to get a response, controllers that die within a week of use, etc.). Thankfully, this controller has given me no problems. I actually got it used and it works just fine. I highly recommend this product.",

So impressed, he ended up using it until it couldn't be used anymore. He eeked out the use of that headset until we could get another one. It took awhile to get this since every time I tried to order it, it was on backorder but patience is a virtue and once ordered, it came in good time. It works as expected which is a pretty high expectation. It isn't just the sound that is good; it is the fit. He's particular about the fit of headsets and this one is the most comfortable. A little outside the budget but definitely a worthwhile buy.",

Then you better quick save because as soon as you try to jump on them they'll fall down and you'll have to start again. All the surfaces except the floor seem very slippery and moving on them is another exercise in frustration. I quit at the military base because I didn't spend $20 to waste 30 minutes randomly hitting tanks to stack them up so I could move on.<br /><br />Most of the secret locations and holy items are almost impossible to reach unless you are prepared to spend a ridiculous amount of time on it.

The mouse as is, comes with a nice set of features and accessories right out of the box, it comes with weights and a different grip, which can be easily swapped and adjusted with ease. the mouse also is very nice since it has sensitivity adjustment and two extra buttons right at your fingertips to make in-game adjustments and play style adjustments simple. I find myself thankful for the DPI adjustment buttons whenever I switch between sniping, regular gunfights and piloting vehicles, since they all work better with different levels of sensitivity. like any Logitech mouse, you can easily change the DPI levels to suit the situations, and the G9x can set 5 levels per profile, anywhere between 200 and 5700 DPI. Personally I have 500 DPI for sniping, 1800 DPI for other combat or general use and 2400 DPI for vehicles. ever since I switched to this mouse, it feels like I can finally point EXACTLY where I want to in games, and with most of the games I play requiring lighting reflexes and precision, I have been able to stay alive longer in FPS games and kill enemies with much more ease, the moment I get hit by any enemy, I am able to whip around and accurately return fire in an instant. one thing I have to complain about is that the textured grip wears down very quickly.<br /><br />on another note, I have pretty small hands, and I still find this mouse to be very comfortable, it just took a bit to get used to it, since its between a large and mini-mouse in size, i guess you can consider it medium-large.<br /><br />This is one of the best mice I have ever used, and would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a very nice and very customizable wired mouse for gaming without shelling out too much.",

Many guns you'll hit 3-4 shots and the guy will still be alive.<br /><br />Zombies is there, and if you like zombies mode, you'll like it. I'm not a fan of the mode myself, but did think this one was much better than BO3.<br /><br />Headquarters is kinda ridiculous. A social hub-like area kind of like Destiny where all the players congregate. They put this here so you can open lootboxes in front of other players, enticing them to buy them. Scummy move. The UI in headquarters is atrocious. Player names everywhere, tons of voice chatter which you're not able to disable permanently, you'll need to do so every time you go in. The shootout challenges are pretty decent. Compete against other players doing target practice.<br /><br />I mean, it's COD. If you generally like the COD franchise, I think you'll like it. Glad it's back to boots on the ground and not running along walls and jetpacking. Personally, I'd rather just play battlefield 1.

Nolan, (look young, Feel young) lol<br /><br />I pre-ordered this game simply because the PS3 version is awesome.In the PS3 version the Create mode enables you to...<br /> 1) have 3 layers of depth that allow you to make your created levels more apealing to the eye and more diverse in the veriety of electronics and machines you can create.<br /> 2) Be able to easly make any shape of any size in a short amount of time.<br /> 3) Not be restricted by the operating system.<br /><br />Such in not so in the PSP create mode. It only has 2 layers of depth. And it is very difficult to make a shape that you want. (Being an advanced creator I sometimes make very complex polygons and things of that nature) Also the controls are very hard to get used to. By now you should have realized that my primary purpose in LBP is to Create.<br /><br />On the up side of things. The story levels in this new version are quite exiting. (I doubt that Media Modules only used the controls and items offered to you in the create mode to make their complex levels.) Anyway they are very fun and enjoyable for awhile. Being as early as it is in this new versions history, I'm not suprised at all that there are very few fun community levels. This is understandable due to the restricted tools and ability of the new create mode. So don't expect to be wowed by the imagination of your fellow Sackboys in the version.<br /><br />So to close I say that If you want this game to be able to create while on the move, I wouldn't recomend it unless you have the patience to handle it. If you just like to play the levels, it's not a bad idea to try this new version out. If you have a PS3 and do not have this game for that particular system I would highly advise you to purchase it!<br /><br />I hope this review helped you.<br /><br />I &lt;3 LBP",

I'm still trying out everything, but so far Magical Drop 2 has absorbed most of my time. The NES Burger Time is off from the arcade version in frustrating ways, but maybe I'll get used to it. Joe and Mac 2 is good as ever, and Side Pocket is weirdly addictive. Burnin' Rubber, aka Bump'n'Jump, is probably my favorite title here.<br /><br />Karate Champ has not held up well. Fighter's History is not a patch on Street Fighter II, but for a system with few fighting game options so far, it's one of the best. Bad Dudes and Two Crude Dudes aren't quite as sublimely over the top as their arcade versions, but they're still a good laugh and really fun examples of a genre that I'm not great at.

I didn't get any sound out of it at first (except for it telling me that it was powered on or politely saying goodbye) until it was fully charged, and then everything fell into place after that. It needs to be paired with the PS3 first as instructed or you cannot set it as your input/output device in the PS3 settings.<br /><br />There are three modes - game, movie and music. With game mode, you can choose from eight presets to enhance your gaming experience. There are also about eight presets for chatting, some of which can alter the sound of your voice. In addition, you can plug your headset into your computer and go to the Turtle Beach website (http://www.turtlebeach.com/community/preset-community) to customize the sounds of your favorite games to give yourself a competitive advantage, or to immerse yourself in the game through the use of audio presets and voice prompts. You will need to register to get access to the customization tools and to download Turtle Beach and Community created audio presets.<br /><br />The sound quality is excellent for game play, (for example, you can hear the footsteps of your opponents even before they come around a corner) as well as for chatting with other players while playing. In addition, the earphones are very comfortable for long hours of use and block out any surrounding noise.<br /><br />Another great feature is the Dolby surround sound. There are six easily accessible settings that you can use to get the effects to suit your current gaming mood.<br /><br />It takes about 6 hours to charge, but this is not a problem as you can continue playing while it is charging. The manufacturer states that a full charge lasts about 15 hours, but due to real life interruptions I have not been able to verify this.<br /><br />The headset can be paired via Bluetooth to two Bluetooth enabled devices simultaneously. For example, you can chat via your PS3 when playing a game and still receive/make phone calls, but I haven't tried the phone part as yet. There are separate Bluetooth volume controls on the right ear cup to adjust the chat/phone volume (Game volume controls are on the left ear cup)<br /><br />Finally, using the mobile device cable supplied, you can plug it into any regular earphone jack and the headset can now be used as regular earphones with your audio device (music/MP3 player, computer, tablet, smartphone, etc.)<br /><br />Overall, the sound is great and truly enhances your entire gaming experience.",

But I never knew it was such a hassle to get the PS3 controllers to charge without the actual PS3 system. Smartphone wall adapters DO NOT work. Third party docking products on Amazon do not come with a power adapter, only USB cables. Which means they probably require you to have your PS3 on.  I've asked if Smartphone wall adapters will work with those third party docks, they say yes, but I don't trust the answer.  I kept searching and ran onto this official Playstation product. This is just what the doctor ordered! Actually, a computer will charge your ps3 controllers too, but I'd like all my game accessories in my media cabinet. This adapter tucks in the back of my cabinet and the ps3 controllers are now charging inside my cabinet out of sight, out of mind. $10 and it's an official item. Doesn't get any better!",

This Tilted Nation stand has everything that I was looking for. It's sturdy and looks really nice on my desk.

I am not sure what happened but since then it has worked fine. I love the fact that I can also use the base to plug in a couple other USB 3.0 devices such as my RGB mouse-pad and even an SD card reader.

It feels a lot more realistic, a lot more one-shot, one-kill in Medal of Honor, but the fact that it doesn't support same console split-screen coop as part of it's special forces multiplayer mission sort of forces you to play online in two-man teams with near strangers and that isn't super conducive to the type of stealth and support tactics necessary in this seriously hard core multi-player mode.<br /><br />If the single player campaign had been longer (maybe twice as long) and the multi-player supported same console coop missions, I would have given this a 5 star rating.",

            "question": "title: An entertaining but imperfect ride\ntext: BioShock Infinite is the third installment in the series of games which began with 2007's much-acclaimed BioShock.  While the game has some similarities to the earlier games of the series, Infinite is quite different in other areas which are sure to make some fans rankle.  Overall I found it an entertaining, if somewhat flawed game.  To explain why, I will start with the \"cons\", since that seems to be what most people are interested in when reading reviews, and then I will follow with what I think worked rather well in Infinite.<br /><br />SPOILERS!  -- THERE WILL BE SPOILERS HERE -- DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE EXPOSED TO SPOILERS! -- SPOILERS!<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />1.  Combat System.  The combat system has been substantially simplified in many areas.<br /><br />First, the player is limited to carrying only two weapons.  This appears intended to require more tradeoffs to be made by the player, but can feel like an irritating limitation as compared with the previous games.  It can also discourage upgrading too many weapons, because the player will most likely have one \"keeper\" weapon and one \"off\" weapon using this system, which tends to make the game play very similarly over the course of the game.<br /><br />Second, the setting of the game features mostly wide open areas, unlike the cramped conditions of Rapture from the earlier games.  This makes the gameplay much easier as a practical matter, and much more typical of a generic shooter type game.<br /><br />Third, the game lacks truly challenging enemies like the first two games had.  No enemy here is really like a Big Daddy in difficulty or challenge, and even the tougher enemies (patriots, handymen, firemen, ravens) are really not very tough to beat in terms of requiring significant tactical thought and adjustment.<br /><br />2.  Linear design.  Unlike the earlier games, where the player could move around the entire map freely, exploring or collecting resources and the like, Infinite is a linear experience where the player progresses through areas that are then closed.  These can be reloaded from a chapter menu, but that is simply \"replaying a zone\" -- it isn't exploring a city organically as was the case with the earlier games.  This serves the narrative, but tends to make Infinite feel more \"gamey\" than the earlier titles in a forced way.<br /><br />3.  Story Problems.  SPOIILER!-- SPOILER! -- SPOILER!  Here there will be a lot of disagreement among the playerbase.<br /><br />The storyline essentially revolves around Ken Levine's narrative gloss on the theoretical physics theory of the multiverse.  Some players will find this irritatingly similar to films like Inception, and others will just find it confusing.<br /><br />The issue I have with it is that it kind of plays lip service to some of these theoretical physics ideas (multiverse theory), and makes various hand-waves at quantum physics throughout the game (some of which are bound to go over most players' heads, but that's a separate problem), but then violates these ideas in substantial and problematic ways without explanation.  For example, it is a known time travel paradox that one cannot travel back in time because doing so will compromise one's contemporary existence -- this is even more the case where one is going back in time to kill oneself, or precisely to allow oneself to be killed, by one's offspring --> this is an impossible paradox, because if you kill yourself at an earlier period, you would never exist to come back in time and kill yourself to begin with.  It's a paradoxical loop, which is one reason why physicists have been skeptical of time-travel.  Now, time-travel is fine in a setting where the plot is fantasia and soft and so on, but if you are throwing in references to quantum mechanics and string theory and so on throughout the game, playing fast and loose with some of the ideas feels, well, snarky.<br /><br />A similar issue is raised with respect to the entire treatment of multiple universes in the game.  The multiverse theory, which is more speculation than hard science anyway but is still a theory floated by theoretical physicists, posits that there are infinite universes.  This means that, in theory, there are infinite versions of you, and infinite possibilities for how your life plays out in an infinite number of universes.  The game's name itself is a reference to this theory.  But the multiverse theory also implies that no *one* universe is dispositive of what happens in the others -- there is no \"core reality\" from which the rest of the possibilities emerge.  There is simply an infinite number of parallel realities.  This is problematic for the game, where clearly the suggestion is that the drowning of the player's character in the game dispositively removes all instances of the game's main antagonist in all possible universes -- something which doesn't make sense per the actual theory of the multiverse.  Instead, the \"game's theory\" appears to be that there is a core reality which is determinitive of other possibilities -- which is a nice theory, but it isn't the multiverse, and it isn't explained in the game, either.  Now, I realize that this is a video game and not a physics textbook, and that therefore the narrative should be more important than the science.  That's true.  But, again, if it's just a case of \"making stuff up\" in a nice way to serve a narrative purpose, then the game ought not do so much hand-waving and term dropping from *actual* quantum physics -- this just comes across as intellectually snarky.<br /><br />Clearly the game and its ending were designed to cause controversy, and thereby generate attention.  That has been a success.  Upon further review, however, the ending becomes more problematic, even if taken from a purely narrative point of view.  Paradoxes are fine, but raising *known* paradoxes and not addressing them at all feels ... sloppy.<br /><br />4.  No Manual Saves.  I realize that this is a point of contention in the player community, some of which seems convinced that the ability to save anywhere outside combat is game breaking.  However, the problem with Infinite is that the automatic save points are very spread out.  It's not uncommon for a player who likes to explore to lose 15-30 minutes of game time if they need to quit the game on short notice -- as is not uncommon for people who are fairly busy.  This is a very unfortunate design for a game like this one, and really should be changed in a patch.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />1.  Fun game world.  As noted above, this isn't Rapture, it's Columbia.  Rapture probably had more personality, and was certainly creepier, while Columbia is airier and more subservient to the overall narrative.  Columbia here is a backdrop, whereas Rapture was a character.  But ... it's an entertaining backdrop and filled with fun details.<br /><br />2.  Interesting switch-back themes.  While it was thought prior to Infinite's release that the game would mostly be a pointed criticism of right-wing American mytholog(ies), in reality it is more the case that the game whipsaws themes around in an interesting way.  Thus while it's true that the initial portrayal of Columbia as a racist, fundamentalist bubble that worships the founders of the US is an easy and over the top take on something most people already see as false, this theme is not a main one in the game.  In subsequent chapters the game takes the freedom fighters (whom the player probably identifies as \"good guys\" as compared with the racist fundamentalists of the game's early chapters) and turns them into vicious violent killers which it explicitly says are just as bad as the racists.  This challenges assumptions which the player had probably already internalized about them by then, which creates discomfort -- that is well done.  The game also portrays the scientist couple -- which one would \"normally\" see as the foil to the fundamentalist zealots -- and makes them morally ambiguous at best, portraying them as almost amoral and more or less powerless to stop, if not downright helping, the fundamentalists.  And, finally, the game takes the female character, Elizabeth, and kind of toys with whether she will be a love interest for the player character before revealing that she, or a previous version of her, was his daughter (in this or another universe, apparently), which, again, challenges assumptions.  The way that these themes cascade to challenge assumptions is fairly well done in the plotting.<br /><br />3.  Some fun fight sequences, like the rail fights (which are not spectacular by any means, but fun) helped make the combat, which is overall fairly lackluster, a bit more interesting at times.<br /><br />=======<br /><br />Summary (TL;DR):<br /><br />Infinite is a good, but not great, game characterized by a good narrative which nevertheless plays fast and loose with theoretical physics and average shooter style combat which is occasionally livened up in a few sequences.  It's fun to play and I found it enjoyable, but I think that the \"it's the best game ever!\" type of breathless reviews it is is getting miss the mark by overlooking some aspects of the game that are less than stellar or simply problematic.",

Probably by someone with some financial stake in this product.<br /><br />1. Let's start with the most important issue first: the product doesn't work as described. When you play tennis on the Wii, the controller is held so that the buttons face the ceiling and the left and right edges represent the forehand and backhand. Well when you do that with this device, guess what? The racquet faces the ceiling also. Anyone play real tennis with the racquet facing the sky? Didn't think so.<br /><br />2. It is not the same size or weight as a real tennis racquet, unless you play tennis with a racquet 16\" long that weighs 4 ounces.<br /><br />3.

I had to assist her getting the game installed, manually installing the needed patch and doing some other things to get the game running.<br /><br />There are instructions online to get the game installed, patched and working, so as long as you can follow those instructions, you should be okay. It can be intimidating, and a time-consuming process if you aren't super-comfortable with troubleshooting software issues. Searching for \"Sims 3 mac super-patcher\" should bring you to the EA site or the bluebellflora site with similar steps on installing the patch manually.<br /><br />Also, once everything was installed and the game actually launched, the \"Late Night\" expansion gave a disc authentication error. Just removing and reinserting the disc, and restarting the game seemed to fix that. Apparently it's a common issue.",

I'm brand new to this Res Evil game, played most of the others beat them and loved them.  This one first off you can't just start kind of can I guess, it's wants you to wait for players to join or to join someone elses game.  No players joined and I waited about six to seven minutes and started it, all I had was a shot gun which wound up being useless at the beginning of the game so I more or less had to wait for my team to get me through to the next part, I did help all I could with my shot gun again stating, second game I made because the shot gun was lame I picked a character with a rifle automatic or something like a gun of some sort that doesn't scatter shot and shoots fast over and over.  Much Much better, actually was kicking some but and said this is more like it.  Till the first monster guy came into play, he chases you (spoiler by the way) all the way back from where you came and kills you a few times if you don't flee fast enough.  Till you finally have to fight him is the part I'm at right now and can't hit his weak spot for the life of me, yeah I know bet I wish I had a shot gun now.  LOL  No I wish my teamates would blast the hell out of him keeping him busy while I nuked his ass with hand granades and hit the weak spot with a stream of bullets.  Not hitting the weakspot just stuns him for two sec or so sometimes.  Now the part that is lame as hell is I can't beat him dinners ready, I want to watch my movie now but can't just shut it down because either it hasn't auto saved yet or I didn't see the icon showing it did, and I can't manually go to save game because there is no save game icon on half these high end games anymore.  Which means playing stuff you already played over again just to get to where you where when you quit and that could be ten or fifteen minutes of gameplay, such ka ka.  So tomorrow, maybe I will start it up and see where I am and watch the Rad Brad video again on how to beat this guy or boss or monster.  Should be two stars but it's not a bad game and I love res evil, oh yeah died like six times at beginning in like the third battle area, when the reinforcments come and of course had to start all over from beginning of game, which means a half an hour wasted and still right at start point.  Why have auto save and no manual save games, what about when mom says turn it off now, sorry mom I have to play till I see the little icon that means game saveing and that could be ten minutes to a half hour generally.  Technology is such bull s*** sometimes, they just don't care just another way to keep you hooked, spending and going in the directions they force us to go in.  Peace and Live Long and Prosper.  Please no jerk comments back, thank you.  ps games worth six to eight bucks I guess, surely not fifty or anything close to that.",

The right shift key is also a bit smaller than I'm used to, so I sometimes press up-arrow by accident when typing fast (90+ wpm).<br /><br />Pros: The quality of the keyboard is awesome. The form factor is awesome. Nice and small and doesn't take up a ton of room on the desktop. The light-up features are really freaking cool.<br /><br />Conclusion: I really wanted to give this keyboard 5 stars. I can live with having to press FN for the Function Keys, and can also live with the smaller right shift key, but I really can't live with where the question mark is placed.

I appreciate that it doesn't have teeny tiny buttons too small for even toddler fingers to press singly, but rather nice sized buttons that won't having accidentally casting (and wasting) a spell/ability.<br /><br />The new RoG mouse doesn't feel the same in my hand and has different button placement - it may have been a matter of being used to this one and not giving the new mouse enough play time to get used to it, but I switched back to this mouse and ordered a 2nd for when this one bites the dust.",

Compared to the first-generation &#34;bar of soap&#34; classic controller, this is a major step up in comfortability and functionality. To my knowledge, this is also one of the first Wii classic controllers with a turbo feature, so if you play any button mashers, this will definitely give you an edge.<br />PROS:<br /> - The ZL, ZR, A, B, X, and Y buttons and the D-pad all depress with a satisfyingly loud, uh, button-pressing sound, and they have a strong, quick return.<br /> - The analog sticks feel just like the originals and recenter perfectly.<br /> - The turbo feature works for the L, ZL, R, ZR, A, B, X, and Y buttons and the D-pad, and any number of them can be set to turbo simultaneously.<br /> - The turbo speed switch is easy to move without being too loose.<br /> - The Pikachu artwork on the front is applied with the same quality as the GameCube logo was applied to the original. It doesn't stand above the surface visibly or tactilely and it feels like it's going to last. It's not some cheap decal or stencil-job.<br /> - The case screws are regular Phillips-head screws, not Nintendo's proprietary tri-wing screws, making the controller somewhat easier to repair.<br />CONS:<br /> - The C-stick was cast with a slight misalignment. It left an obvious, though structurally-sound, seam on one side.<br /> - As there is no analog trigger support in Nintendo systems following the GameCube, the L and R buttons now hinge from the top (like the B button on a Wii remote) and have about the same amount of travel as the other buttons, leaving me to miss the plunger-action and satisfying *click* of the original L and R buttons. They also have a shallower curvature, making it easier for your finger to slip off.<br /> - The turbo, start/+, select/-, and home buttons are all rubber like TV remote buttons instead of hard plastic like the GameCube controller's start button was. There's nothing inherently wrong with this, but they feel less satisfying to press and will likely wear out sooner than plastic.",

I found that attacks were difficult to control (at best) and I often had no idea where I was aiming.  There is no &quot;camera control&quot; available, and it's quite easy to navigate Rygar off the screen entirely.  Also, game play forces the user to use the analog control, whereas I prefer the cross-bar control; strangely, the options screen only responds to the cross-bar and not the analog.  It's obvious that Tecmo spent little time doing usability testing on this game.<br /> - Enemies and fighting sequences are repetative and dull.  Yawn.<br />  All in all, pass.

            "question": "title: This is the best XBox-style controller ever made - as many top PC reviews have acknowledged\ntext: I have own several MS controllers over the years - first the 360 series, then two controllers since, the latest MS controller was the XBox One Wireless for XBox and PC.  It was a solid controller.  BUT....<br /><br />Fast forward just a couple years and Razer have delivered truly superior controllers.  In my opinion, the best of these is this one, the Razer Wolverine Ultimate.  Not only are the extra paddle controllers seriously well-designed and implemented, but the alternative shoulder buttons [two of the six extra controls in all] are, for me, more easily accessible and that translates to better mobility and faster response for me.<br /><br />I was a bit disappointed to discover that the full setup and sensitivity adjustment is only available from their XBox Controller Setup and Configuration utility (their own website and documentation indicate that this can be done from their Synapse software, but it cannot be.  That is wrong [not a misprint really - it blatantly says that Synapse will handle setup].  This is not an issue for most, but since they make the utility ONLY available from Microsoft Store, it is an issue for many like myself.<br /><br />Fortunately, most game software today will provide at least minimal adjustment of sensitivity [for stick controls, i.e. deadzone and x/y responsiveness].  The MS Store is often a corrupted mechanism on Windows computers - just google a little and you'll find out that many suffer from MS Store AppxBundles not being handled or failing to install due to \"unknown error 0x800700005\" and similar - which turn out to be registry permissions corruptions (mine were caused by a Windows patch via \"Windows Update\" of all things).  This means no Razer setup utility for me. (I am not going to reinstall the OS and all my software and configuration tweaks just to get this utility working).  I don't need MS Store and I will never use it... even though MS cons their direct competitors (yes, MS manufactures an XBox controller too, did you know? lol) in to relying upon them for this Software Distribution.. i.e. fox and henhouse.  They make Synapse, along with the Macro module, and the Chroma/RGB software available from Razer's website, but not this one controller setup utility [which is Razer software, after all].  Not sure why.<br /><br />You can get by FINE without this Razer utility though - the controller is ONBOARD programmable, i.e. the means to override the default settings for the six \"M buttons\" is built in to the device itself and documented in the user guide.  There is even a MACRO capability available via Synapse and an add-on module.  This allows complex keyboard sequences to be associated to one or more button presses [i.e. L-Shoulder longpress + A, B, X, Y, etc...].<br /><br />This controller is the best I've ever used for PC gaming [if I still used XBox that would apply as well].  I love it.  I don't really need the RGB light-show, which is admittedly cool I guess, and even rarely use the M buttons.  It is just the feel and response that I find unequaled.",

There's also in-game calibration to help off-set the audio-visual timing in the game, but it does not change the lag in response from the time you strum to the time you hear your guitar.  It's still an awesome game with awesome features, challenges, full songs, and minigames. I like the Auto Level-Up feature which means you can start a song on easy mode, and if you do well enough, it will up the difficulty mid-song.",

            "question": "title: Excellent Headphones\ntext: The sound is very good. The headset is perhaps the most lightweight and comfortable I've used so far. It's also completely plug and play. You plug the headphones in and you are good to go, no drivers or other software needed. Some headphones show up as unique items under the audio settings. So when you want to use them, you need to go to your settings to manually select them after you plug them in. Not these. Just unplug your speakers, plug in the headset and go from there.<br /><br />A lot of manufacturers seem to think all gamers are middle school kids who need and want flashing lights on everything. The last set of \"gaming\" headphones I tried put ridiculous colored lights on the headphones. I say ridiculous because you can't see those lights when you are actually wearing the headset. So I appreciate the fact that this headset eschewed such nonsense, focusing instead on audio quality and the comfortableness of the headset.<br /><br />There are two cautions I need to add. Though neither was a big deal to me, you should be aware of them. The first is that the cord on this headset is shorter than other headsets I've used. My set up is a main computer that I actually game on with a second computer to the side that I run Discord on. That way I don't have to flip in and out of the game to deal with Discord issues. The cord on this headset is fine for use with my main computer but is too short to reach the secondary machine. Depending on your set up, the length of the cord may or may not be an issue to you.<br /><br />For me that also means I haven't tried the microphone on this headset, just the headphones. Given the quality of this product I wouldn't expect there to be an issue with the mic, but you might check the other reviews here to see what they say about that. Thanks for reading this and I hope you enjoy this product.",

The controller fits easily into the slot.  It doesn't slide out, but with LOTS of shaking, could fall out.  The best part is that covers have buttons on the top that connect to the small buttons on the sides of the joycon and so they are now so much easier to push.

I just finished playing Stardew Valley, and PoOT feels so empty in comparison. PoOT is fun starting out as you begin exploring the area, but it really is just a huge knock-off of Stardew without any of the flare. Super sad to realize this.<br /><br />**UPDATE** I can't knock it down a star because I love this game so much, but... the glitches have definitely started. I've frozen and had to restart the game once while in a mine (now I save every time before I enter a mine), the frame rate when I enter an area of my farm with lots of building or crops is terrible, and every five or ten (real time) minutes the whole screen freezes for about half a second. Super annoying. I really hope this gets fixed in the May patch.<br /><br />It has literally been a decade since I enjoyed a Harvest Moon game (last played was Animal Parade in 2011), which I am sure is in part due to Natsume's decision to drive the \"Harvest Moon\" brand into the ground. I have been hearing about Story of Seasons for years, but this is my first time actually playing one of their games. I am THRILLED. No more overly complicated constructions schemes for farm buildings, no more pointless and complicated sprite mini-games. Just a simple farming sim that is relaxing to play in the way that AWL and FoMT were (maybe not QUITE as simple as FoMT).<br /><br />This is also the earliest I've ever played a newly released HM (I guess now SoS) game, and it's really not bothering me at all. I have quite a few upgrades on my farm and no glitches yet. I started playing April 12th, so it's possible that I'm not having problems because I started after the first couple patches had cleared. I am looking forward to the patch in May -- but personally, I already like the townspeople's personalities and don't think they're bland at all. If anything, they're more reminiscent of the oldest HM games to me. Lots of simplicity and focus on aesthetic.",

When I ordered them, I was initially excited about them. I have some Turtle Beach headphones that are slightly more expensive than these, but they do tend to become slightly uncomfortable after long periods of time.<br /><br />So I ordered these. I was on the boat about the cord, but I actually prefer cords over wireless in such devices so that I don't have to worry about scrambling for batteries or charging it when the battery's low. The length of the cord is good for my living room.<br /><br />When I plugged it into my PS3, having not yet read the instructions, I was surprised that there was no sound coming through. So I perused through the quick setup and was aghast that I, indeed, had to use the included audio jacks. I really really really really really don't like audio jacks. I understand that they might \"improve\" or have a work-around for audio, but the fact that I have to get my jacks out of my PS3 box just to plug `em into the back of the TV for audio (and since my TV has only one set of RCA ports, into which my Atari is plugged), it's really inconvenient and messy when I have to use the ol' red and white audio jacks. Haven't they done a work-around for this? I have HDMI cables, and I love `em. Surely Thrustmaster can do better. My Turtle Beach headphones, while understandably more expensive, connect into the front USB port...and that's it.<br /><br />So when I finally did what Thrustmaster bid, I tried the sound quality, and it didn't negate my already negative feelings toward the headphones. The sound sounds almost tinny, and the headphones and their longest stretch barely fit `round my head, and I don't even have a big head! I usually click two or three times on headphones to make `em fit, but on these Thrustmasters I had to pull `em all the way and even then they fit just so.<br /><br />I tried these on my iPhone, but the jack is a little big to fit with the case on my iPhone, so I took it out and tried the sound. It was rather worse since it was meant to utilize the red and white audio jacks.<br />Disgusting.<br /><br />Overall, I am disappointed. Perhaps I'm spoiled by my Creative and Turtle Beach headphones, but for the price Thrustmaster could do better. Or maybe even lower the price point. My $20 Sennheisers sound better, but I'm a big fan of Sennheiser. So there.",

I like the concept of finding boxes with items, hunting animals and plants, and creating items to use or sell.  Selling things to get weapons and other items from the store works pretty well.  My only complaint is how slow it runs on my PC.  It makes it difficult to move the cursor to a moving target (slight complaint here as target animals and enemies move around more than is realistic), and steer the character when running. I'm hoping is is a setting somewhere that I can fix.  My PC is a new high end gaming rig so it's not like it should be overwhelmed.  Even with the slowness the game is playable, so I look forward to getting it to run smooth.  I gave it four stars because I am not detracting from it just because it runs slow on my PC.  The game itself is good and anyone that enjoys survivor shows or series will probably enjoy this game.<br /><br />CA Luster",

            "question": "title: A great last hurrah for the Sims 3.\ntext: Note: this is a stuff pack, which means that it is a bunch of add-ons for the Sims 3 game. You must own the base game for this to work for you. This pack does not add any kind of additional game play options and is just clothes, hairs, and objects for your existing game. You do not need anything except the base game to install or run this stuff pack. You also don't need the internet, if you're buying it on a disk, and it works just fine in both a Mac and PC.<br /><br />This is a really cute stuff pack. It has three distinct themes: a Western theme, a gothic/vampire/spooky theme, and a superhero theme. They're all nicely detailed and imaginative, with no obvious misfires. And there are a *lot* of things in this set--a lot more than in a normal stuff pack. I'm just amazed at how much stuff is in here.<br /><br />* Western: Very versatile and boasting a lot of little decorative touches. The recolor channels are nicely done, so you can really use this stuff just about anywhere. I especially loved the clothes and hairs in this theme. I've been using one of the men's outfits just about everywhere. The objects are also excellent; you could use them (even if slightly recolored) just about anywhere, but especially in any old-fashioned theme at all (like a saloon or Country/Western bar). I especially really liked having more rocking chairs--these are probably the nicest ones EA has done yet--and more Western-themed wall art. Loved this set. The whole Stuff Pack could have gone along these lines, and I'd have been fine with it. The feather hairdo is beautiful too. 10/10.<br /><br />* Spooky theme: Not bad. Garish and Tim Burton-feeling. Midnight Hollow and Moonlight Falls fans will love this stuff. The clothes are lovely in a Miss Havisham sort of way; the hairs less so. The object set is, with recoloration, usable for the most part. I did especially like the deco stuff, though some of the other things are off-putting in anything but a strong Gothique set. 6/10<br /><br />* Superhero/Villain theme: There's a shocking Frank-N-Furter outfit for men in here, and the women's costumes are really cute--this stuff would work well for performer Sims in Showtime. The objects are a little childish-looking--but by that token they're good for kids' rooms and other similar spaces (like sports bars). The laser ray-gun sculpture on the cover is actually a very large floor lamp--and it's really cool-looking to see ingame. I guess if you like this kind of theme, you'll like this part of the stuff pack. I didn't really, though I do respect the artistry and imagination involved. With recoloring, this part of the set could fit into a futuristic build. 4/10.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say that anybody who does a lot of Victorian/Western type building, or who likes the more supernatural/spooky type of play, will love this set. If you see something in it that you like, rest assured it's well-made and will look good in your game. If you don't care about these themes, like if you really like a more hipster/urban look to your game, you may not care for this stuff pack at all. Also, if you like to buy stuff that adds new functionality to your game, none of these things will do that. This is just three really nice sets of stuff and create-a-Sim things. They are however very nice and plentiful, and I recommend it to those who are drawn to the kinds of themes depicted.",

You’re either a retro gamer, A collector, Or someone whose experiencing these titles for the first time (I wish I was) it’s a VERY nice collection with tons and tons of Museum pieces to learn about the history of each game. The presentation is crystal clear and you can literally customize it to your complete liking! Then why not a perfect 5 stars? Well….<br />There’s no new ground here. Aside from the unreleased darkstalkers title, Most have played these games in various other collections, But what baffles me the most is that this came out 2 weeks apart from capcom Arcade collection 2, Which included most of the games listed on here already! I feel like it was a bit of a cash grab to do that to the fans. I love old school capcom (You can only like current time capcom if you enjoy resident evil or Monster hunter since that’s all they seem to put their efforts on to these days)<br />It’s an amazing little collection, Is it worth $40? A little hard to say. If you don’t love retro gaming or are new to the genre in general this would exactly be the best place to start. The games are unforgiving in difficulty, Although you can change the settings technically but my kids tried at the lowest difficulty and failed. I can rock it with the difficulty almost all the way up so it’s honestly just a matter of patience and learning curves, Which you will get! But if you want a quick fix, Try Capcom arcade 2 on the digital storefronts. If you want some Hadoukens, Yoga fires, Vampiric and (oddly enough) Cyber mecha fighting, Then look no further! Beautiful graphics that can be smoother out in options or even made to look like the days of the arcade!<br />Great selection of games (Although a bit lacking on it being different properties rather than SF, Darkstalkers, etc)<br />The sound is top notch and everutging can be customized to your liking!

And that is a useful & long-desired improvement.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Intuit did its usual half-hearted, half-designed job with this feature, and it's quite disappointing:<br />1.  You can't sync investment accounts.  The old investing.quicken.com site is very limited, not worth using.  (For example, you can't see simple consolidated views of your investments, can't run basic reports. etc.)<br />2.  The sync from the desktop isn't automatic, and takes a long time.  If you're used to other online products that sync to the desktop (think Dropbox & Google Drive as two very popular examples, there are many others), you will find this clunky & old-tech.  Everytime you open Quicken, it will tell you you made changes, whether you did or not, and suggest that you sync.  This should be an automated, behind the scenes process, it's not hard.<br />3.  The alerts are rather dumb, and they're essentially hard-coded.  You can't create your own rules, and you can't even do a lot with the built-in rules (you can just pick some parameters from a limited list).  You can't delete them all either, if you consider them dumb and pointless.  Again, not hard to do a lot better.<br /><br />There are no significant improvements in reporting, or in investment analysis.  If you look at the \"What's new in 2013\" page, you see mobile, alerts, and \"more flexible budgeting\", whatever that means.<br /><br />There is a tweak to how accounts show up in the nav bar, where you can put some accounts in the \"Separate\" list, which means \"show but don't include with main set of accounts\".  This is mildly useful.  There's also a feature to mark an account \"closed\", also slightly useful -- in theory.  These account still show up in the list of accounts when you're doing a transfer between investment accounts!  Clearly someone forgot what the word \"closed\" might mean.<br /><br />So all in all, same old Intuit, same old Quicken.  Buy it if the mobile feature is useful to you.

The Kindle itself would not give a true bibliophile the sensory stimulation of a bound ink on paper book, but this leather lighted cover adds a little bulk to the electronic device making it more resemble a small book in size, while providing protection and illumination.<br /><br />The Kindle Lighted Leather Cover is lighter in weight than I'd expected, more rigid, better constructed of a high quality beautiful leather, and ergonomically designed for every day use.  With care during installation of the Kindle, I expect it to have a long life, particularly since I do not attempt to move the rear cover away from the Kindle device while it's housed.  Letting it be and simply lifting the front cover to open, folding it back for reading, and returning it to the closed position for storage should keep it intact.  When the front cover is folded back for reading, the round elastic band can be reversed around both front and back covers to keep them joined and make the covered Kindle easier to hold.  When the case is closed, the elastic band fits into a small groove on the front of the case where the two different leather textures are seamed.  I love that detail.  A small leather tab can be slid along the elastic and it also can be flipped to face either right or left.  I sometimes move it up or down as a hint to remember something.  It has the impression, \"amazon kindle,\"  so I'm likely to remember what's in the case.  The light is powerful, considering its small size, and it's very easy to pull out and push into it's corner home.  It is unobtrusive and quite functional.  My brain on more than one occasion guided my hand to the rear of the Kindle for the reading light and it took a few seconds for me to realize I needed to put my fingers on the case and not the Kindle.  Because of its angle, the light makes the screen a bit brighter in the upper right quadrant, but my eyes quickly adjust as I read further and become immersed in the words.  If I find myself thinking about the irregularity of the lighting on the screen, I go to my Home Page and select another book.<br /><br />I highly recommend this cover for Kindle owners who want to protect and illuminate their investment and their eyes.

The only downside to the headphone for me is the microphone, the bracket that holds the mic itself doesn't feel like it's made of the same sturdy material as the rest, so I am a little bit concerned with it holding up over time.

I spent a lot of time with Battle Chess, Boogerman, Earthworm Jim, and Clayfighter as a youngin', so I looked forward to playing them again. Battle Chess is agonizingly slow to me now, but it's still pretty fun if you can take a deep breath and relax. Clayfighter has not aged well, but it's still reasonably funny. Boogerman has always been a very solid platformer buried under puddles of snot, and it still is - if you can stomach the \"humor\", the gameplay is pretty darn good. And Earthworm Jim is a stone-cold classic after all these years.<br /><br />I was very interested in the Titus games I never played before. Incantation is a gorgeous platformer with an extremely small viewport (think Bonk). It's a little fiddly, but I'm having a good time with it. Titan is an all-direction Breakout takeoff, except you can slow down time and have to shepherd the ball all over the place. It's a very interesting takeoff. I don't know how long I will enjoy it, but I've found it really rewarding so far.<br /><br />There are tons of amazing games in the Interplay vaults beyond what's included in Volumes 1 and 2.

            "question": "title: what a disappointment\ntext: The TLDR version:<br /><br />I am giving the game 2 stars because it is fun at first, but if I could give the endgame a negative rating for being a cynical mechanism for extracting the maximum amount of money and/or time from players in return for unpleasant and unrewarding gameplay, I would.<br /><br />The details:<br />I played both D1 and D2, and while I have fond memories of them, I don't feel all that attached to the franchise.  Nonetheless I was looking forward to it since Blizz announced its release and ponied up for the CE.<br /><br />I was not one of the people who raged at release because of server crashes, glitches, bugs and frequent \"maintenance\" sessions lasting hours, sometimes with little or no warning.  I figured that Blizz was fielding a lot of new ideas and processes with this game.  I was happy with the game, despite huge numbers of reports of botting, duping, hacking, exploits, session spoofing, etc, I figured it didn't really affect me or the people I played with.  I was wrong about that, but never mind.<br /><br />Then two things happened:  the Real Money Auction House (RMAH) and patch 1.3.  I think others have probably gone into a lot of detail about why those two things proved real game changers for more casual players like myself, but for me the net change was that the \"end game\", such as it is, is now basically pay to win.  You need not only to play skillfully, and to understand your class inside and out, which I would expect, but in addition you need really really good gear.  Gear that, because of the way itemization works in the game, you will not get by farming. You must go to the AH, where you will need millions, yes millions, of gold per end game item (unless you want to spend hours surfing the terrible, horrid AH interface for the occasional deal).  A little to much for ya?  Well, off you go to the RMAH, where you can buy what you need for real money!  Don't worry, there's a per-item cap of $250, so you can't go overboard.<br /><br />Subsequent patches have only reduced the options of making in-game gold legitimately, and many of the changes seem to force players more and more to the RMAH as Blizz figures out where exactly players are managing to farm gold and items, and then nerfs those places one after the other.<br /><br />Knowing what I know now, would I buy this game again?  No, and for sure not the Collector's edition.  The one nice thing I can say about the CE is that it did include a free copy of D2, which has been fun to check out again since I stopped playing D3...<br /><br />Should you buy this game.?  Maybe...  I had fun with it through Hell Difficulty and Act 1 Inferno before the RMAH/patch 1.3/repair cost  fiasco.  If you feel that playing up through Hell Difficulty will give you $60 bucks worth of satisfaction, then it might be worth it.  PersonalIy, I was hoping for a little more longevity, but oh well.  *Goes off to play Path of Exile*",

The headband is comfortable and it doesn't feel like my head is being squeezed.<br /><br />The best part is this headset is wireless! The freedom of movement given this wireless feature is priceless. The wireless range is about 20 feet. Once the headset is beyond 20 feet of the transmitter, sound quality quickly drops off. Depending on the distance between the game console and the bathroom and kitchen, 20 feet may not be far enough for bathroom breaks or getting a snack (while still wanting not to miss listening in on game action). However, 20 feet range is plenty for stretching and other movements without worrying about cables.<br /><br />The packaging was marginal.

She is a writer who is leaving her life to pursue her writing dreams and find fulfillment in publishing a novel.<br /><br />Her husband is not interested in her dreams. She decides to seek solitude in an isolated orange grove in Florida. Little does she know, this will not be an ideal life. After 30 years of urban life, she is not prepared for a small Florida town.<br /><br />After many rejections, Marjorie finally realizes \"Gothic Novels\" are not her specialty. Her agent helps her see how interesting her life actually is and she begins to write about what she knows best. In the process she falls in love, makes a best-friend, helps the community by hiring everyone who lives around her to help remodel her house and fix up her orchard.<br /><br />Cross Creek is based on the best-selling memoirs of Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings and has some very human moments when you realize the beauty or ugliness of life. The local business man (Peter Coyote) who falls in love with her, does something so amazing. It reminded me of when my father bought my mother her first car. I only know the story, but the situation is similar. Marjorie of course is very head strong and not about to take help from another man. Until she realizes what Norton Bascomb has secretly done.<br /><br />Slow-paced movie that is more \"cute\" than \"dramatic.\" Although, there are a few heart-wrenching moments.

The controls are really fluid and intuitive. The air combat was really good, a lot of times those things made me motion sick, but this didn’t. The graphics were nice.

I am blown away how polished and well-optimized this engine is compared to whats being used in other games. Graphics look fantastic - textures and movement are very realistic looking. And even with the great graphics, performance is awesome. Very good game for even middling machines.<br /><br />That being said, the story line of this game is just uninteresting to me. The modern warfare theme is tired and blah. I'd rather see this tech (graphics engine, audio, and gameplay) used in an old WWII themed game... or even in another war era (just not modern day). I prefer the older warfighting era due to the simplicity and increased focus on the solider and his gun, rather than all of the network-centric stuff - flying drones, EMP, communications encryption. With Infinity Ward's polish and use of an excellent graphics engine, they could really make a solid older-era warfighting game. Set it apart from the original Medal of Honor and CoD games (i.e. MOHAA and CoD I) though... maybe a vietnam theme? Or WWI theme?<br /><br />All things considered here, MW3 offers very fun gameplay and great eye candy. It's just too bad all of their latest releases are pretty much all the same, thematically.

I'm running White 2 with the C-Gear turned on. Playing it 15 minutes here, 30 minutes there, etc, only closing the lid when it's time to take a break. Using the original battery, the 3DS would have been long dead by now. I would comfortably say this can at least double the battery life. Since it's only a week or so old now, only time will tell if it continues this performance.<br /><br />It does add some weight and thickness to the 3DS, which can be noticeable over lengthy gaming periods.  Couple that with sharp edges of the 3DS (unlike the smoother edges of the DS series) it can cause a bit of discomfort. On the positive side, the bottom of the battery is a rubbery non-skid material which does make it slightly easier to grip, and sits on a table-top without fear of sliding away.<br /><br />The battery is really easy to install. Just four screws, pop off the back lid, pop out the old battery, and insert the new battery. While the included tooth-pick style screwdriver is a nice gesture, don't use it. Any game geek or computer nerd worth their salt should have a precision screwdriver set; if you don't have a set, ask around. You don't want to strip the already-easy-to-strip screws, so be careful. If you're not comfortable with this, find a friend (the same one you borrowed the precision screwdriver from).<br /><br />Be careful how long you take, because many games are time sensitive, and if you take too long, the clock will reset. I did not notice this, and when I tried to sync White 2 to the Global Link, it detected a time change and placed a hard-wait of 24 hours on me. I think I saw a discussion here how to quickly pop it out without losing the date/time.<br /><br />Finally, not sure if it's worth noting, but my 3DS is one of the original NA releases (Ambassador Certificate), so the original battery might have already been approaching its end of life anyways.",

It was easy enough for him to beat without being discouraged, while containing enough extra challenges to keep him engaged. The puzzles that each level posed were perfectly placed for his age group and the story was interesting enough to capture my attention as it played in the background. I wish that more games were able to work as well for the five-six year old age range.<br /><br />We also own Lego Marvel and unfortunately this game, while wonderful, is not as well organized.

            "question": "title: Worse than Useless\ntext: These are cheap plastic shells for the Wii remote meant to give more realism to some of the Wii sports games.  They are worse than useless.  In order to fit the Wii remote into them, you have to  1) remove the soft plastic covering that Nintendo says must be used (when not using these items, presumably) and 2) unplug and remove the Wii motion plus sensor from the bottom of the Wii remote.  Of course, when finished and/or switching to another Wii game that does not involve these faux sports items, you have to 1) re-attach the Wii motion plus sensor and 2) put the soft plastic cover back on the Wii remote.  It it hard to imagine that repeating these actions can have anything but a deleterious effect on the Wii cover and remote and/or motion plus sensor.<br /><br />In addition to all this, the Wii remote functions just fine without them for tennis, fencing, baseball etc.<br /><br />I ordered this along with my first ever Wii without really understanding what I was ordering and what I really needed to play the sports games.  Big mistake.  Now I know.  You don't need this stuff and even if you have it, I think you are unlikely to use it.  The Wii itself is amazing beyond belief.  This plastic junk is as bad as the Wii is great.<br /><br />J.M. Tepper",

            "question": "title: Join the CSI team\ntext: This game is based on the popular original CSI show, the actors from the cast provide the voices.  The premise is to solve a series of crimes along with the CSI team.  Clues are located by sliding over the crime scene then using the appropriate method to interpret the evidence.  Witnesses and suspects are questioned using prompts provided, the answers are added to the physical evidence and used to obtain warrents and ultimately solve the crimes.<br /><br />The graphics are well done, the plot lines are interesting and the game runs quite well, without the hangups or crashes I have experienced with some other Mac platform games.  So why only 4 stars?  It is possible to locate clues simply by rolling over the scene until the clue reveals itself, wrong choices of tools are met with only a prompt as are other wrong guesses, which 'dumbs down' the experience.  The game can be solved by persistence, intelligence only makes the process smoother and quicker.  The biggest problem, however, is that once the game is solved it is done a problem with all games of this puzzle genre.  Unlike the more complicated MYST or Seventh Guest games this one is not sophisticated enough to make going back over solved puzzles to enjoy the experience or challenging enough to make this a long term project.<br /><br />Still it is a fun game, a good way to spend a few hours.  If the more difficult puzzle games have frustrated you or you are new to this type of game, then this one is perfect for you.  If you are a fan of the CSI series this is a good way to spend sometimes between episodes but if you are a serious puzzle gamer and looking for a real challenge this one is not for you.",

I've only played it for a short while so far, but I can tell this is gonna be a fun game.  Graphics are better than expected (especially the fish themselves and the water scenes).  Controls are easy enough (even without the wii pole).  Hint you dont have to revolve the nunchuck in a circle- just bounce it up and down when reeling- works the exact same.  The game also has a real sandbox feel to it (even if you CAN'T fish off your hotel room balcony)and you don't feel limited or confined like so many of the other Wii fishing games (Rapala fishing esp.)  The pop up hints get in the way after a while, but they can be turned off.  So far I've ignored all the other characters except the initial fishing tutor, and the hotel girls.  There are a lot of different \"quest\" fishing challanges so you should not get too bored.  There are also a lot of different areas to fish with different quarry at each one.<br />This game does have a few downsides that stop it from being 5 stars.  No Mii support is a real bummer.  You can customize (to a limited extent) your stock character- but I really believe they could have tossed out the clothing shop and just allowed you to play as your Mii (I mean isn't that the reason you bought a Wii in the first place? so you could use your own creation as a player?).  There is WAY to much talking in the game (well reading actually).  I find I'm pressing the A button so fast that I often miss what is being said (ok lazy on my part- but I really don't need to hear the same schpeal each time I cash in my fish).  Camera angles are sometimes messed up when walking around.  This could be user error but I have not found a way to change the camera angle when I'm walking around.<br />All in all if you enjoy fishing (either real or video game) you will get a kick out of this.  The game is a lot of fun and JUST misses the mark on being one of the BEST Wii games out there.<br />update after YEARS of playing I still stand by my original thoughts.  I have completed just about every aspect of the game and own my own cruiser, have the top tier aquarium, caught every species, and am only missing a dozen S level fish.  I keep coming back and playing this.  It is really enjoyable even if I maxed out my points (999999999 or something like that)  I even bought every lure, piece of clothing, and every piece of tackle.  The game is still fun, and I started another character, just to start it over and work throught it again.  It has good play value even after many hours spent playing.",

            "question": "title: Very Pleased - Build Quality is Fantastic\ntext: Reactions to this mechanical gaming keyboard:<br /><br />* Keyboard is a pleasure to use - the key presses travel well and feel great.<br /><br />* Clicking is definitely noisy - this is true for all mechanical keyboards but this one seems a bit louder than average.<br /><br />* The wire has a cloth mesh around it - pretty common in higher end pc peripherals and this one looks nice.<br /><br />* Comes with a cover in case you transport it a lot - don't have to worry about stuff breaking it or getting in the keys.<br /><br />* The keyboard's USB cable is detachable which is nice for storage.<br /><br />* The textured keys are a neat novelty. If you play a lot of FPS games or MMOs you may really appreciate having the textured keys so that you can place your hand correctly.<br /><br />Additional thoughts:<br /><br />Full disclosure, the HyperX Alloy FPS mechanical keyboard is my first and only experience with mechanical keyboards. Thoughts, in no particular order.<br /><br />Build quality & hardware: The build quality of this keyboard is superb. The specs list that the keyboard has a solid steel frame, and I believe it. The entire thing feels very weighty and solid; there’s no give to the frame at all and no plastic squeak. The keyboard is very portable (I’ve brought it between computers in my apartment and back and forth to work) and has a detachable cable. It includes an extra charging port for … something? The port works as a pass-through; the male end of the USB cable has two connectors though you’ll only need to use one if you don’t plan on using the extra charge port. I’ve used it as a convenient place to plug in my mouse. The port isn’t particularly high amperage (0.9A with a standard USB 3.0 port, as compared to 2 or 3A with modern phone chargers), so I wouldn’t suggest using it to charge your phone or tablet. Overall the keyboard feels extremely sturdy and the build quality is excellent. The aesthetic is very loud – read: 'gamer-y' black with red accents – but doesn’t look too out of place so long as you don’t enable the goofier light modes and stick with the default key caps.<br /><br />Extra features: Advertising for the keyboard touts it’s 100% anti-ghosting “game mode”. For those of you not in the know, ghosting is the problem where some keyboard keys don’t work when multiple keys are pressed simultaneously. Microsoft has a great write-up to explain the problem. I don’t expect to make use of this feature; I don’t play fast-paced games where this has been a problem. Still, it's a novel solution to a problem that would be infuriating should you encounter it. On the keycap front, HyperX includes some additional contrast color and textured keys (WASD, 1234) that can be swapped in if desired. They even include an installation tool that worked well. Ultimately, the keys were hideous and I didn’t find that the texture was helpful for my use case; I chose to revert to the default keys.<br /><br />Mechanical keys: This is my first experience with a mechanical keyboard. The HyperX Alloy FPS uses Cherry MX mechanical keys. I wasn’t sure what I’d think about these, but now I believe the hype! I’d expected to tinker with this keyboard a bit before putting it into storage, but it’s become my preferred keyboard in the house. The travel distance feels just right, and the “click” that comes with each button press provides the perfect amount of feedback. That being said, this keyboard is loud! It’s not an issue if I’m just playing games or reading the internet, but my family members have requested I switch to a different keyboard if I work from home while they are in the room.<br /><br />Overall experience:  I’m very pleased with this keyboard. The build quality is fantastic and it’s very satisfying to use. I’ve used the keyboard for roughly 30 hours at this point, in between the others that I have around the house. It’s not something I’d reach for in every circumstance – again, it’s not a quiet keyboard – but I find myself looking forward to breaking this out.",

When I saw the listing for this product, I thought that it was a great set that included everything I needed for the Quest 2, although from the pictures, I did note that the hand strap seemed flimsy.<br /><br />When I received it, I found that the head strap was made of stiffer plastic than the original straps so it was very difficult to install.  I was still worried about the click-in button at the top of the hand strap and the fact that it was so narrow.  I expected that any swinging of the controller could slip the strap off.  The silicone eye piece fit well, but at first, it gave me a fright because when pressed against the head, the cover would flare out and obstruct the sensor that Oculus proximity sensor, making it think that the headset turn off because it didn't detect a face.  I thought my Oculus was broken!  Lastly, I found that the controllers were hard to fit into the case (They needed to be looped through each other just so) and even then, the case didn't close without the back piece of the headset pushing against the top, creating a slight bulge.  I found that this was a case of \"looks good on paper\" but not great in actuality.<br /><br />Because of all of these problems, I was going to give this product 3 stars, but after spending some time with it, I found that I didn't mind any of those shortcomings.  The head strap is much more comfortable and secure than the original oculus.  The eye piece is MUCH better than the original cloth as sweat is easily wiped off (Facebook is currently addressing this issue and the Oculus will now come with silicone eye pieces).  The hand straps turned out to work well enough.  I don't worry about losing the controllers because I find that I don't have a tendency to flick the controller with my hand completely open.  Lastly, I find that I don't need to use the case when I'm at home so I will only face the awkwardness of putting in the goggles when I intend on taking it on travel.<br /><br />In the end, I got a complete set of accessories all in one package and they do work.  I'm much happier having this set than not.  The out-of-the box experience with the Oculus leaves much to be desired and accessories are just a fact of life.  Just as purchasing a case for a phone or tablet is just part of the cost of the device.",

The last of the ones I had wore out back in the 1990's.  Since that time I have had a succession of less than satisfactory Logitech keyboards. With the demise of the Logitech MK710 I decided enough was enough.  I looked around and the review everywhere for this Das Professional 4 keyboard bordered on idle worship. The Model M had it's version of a mechanical switch clicky-claddery enough to get you killed by the person in the next office cubicle.  I am retired so I don't care how clicky the keys are. The Cherry MX Blue switches are a real joy sold not wobbly, clicky but a nice refined click. One thing about this keyboard is the fact the replacement of the Cherry switches would be very easy for somebody with soldering skills, the MX Blue switch costs .89¢ each at Mouser Electronics, three solder points it is out, and three solder points to install. The case on this keyboard is very solid. The top is aluminium and the bottom is plastic.  I very much like the standup that doubles and a ruler. it goes all of the way across the bottom of keyboard and is much steadier than the puny fold out feeties on other keyboards.  I am sold. If you are an old computer user who started out using the very expensive but very solid IBM Model M's and other heavyweight keyboards from the 1980's here is your keyboard.",

            "question": "title: TS3 returns to its fun and zany roots.\ntext: University Life is probably one of the strongest additions to the Sims 3 franchise, and I suspect a lot of its fun factor comes from the fact that its original creator, Maxis, is finally back on board after a long time separated from the title. I for one welcome our new reptilian overlords. This was a reunion that needed to happen a long time ago.<br /><br />The first thing you'll notice is that there's a whole new world that your Sim can go visit: the University. Similar to the vacation worlds in World Adventures, University is a separate, self-contained neighborhood where your Sim will find a place to live (dorm? Frat/sorority house? or rent an apartment or share a house with roommates or even rent his/her own house?), attend classes like a job, and do all those extra-curricular things college offers like parties, short-term temp jobs, library study, streaking, demonstrations, and visits to the new venues on offer like the Comic Shop, Bowling Alley, and coffeeshop. As usual, the world is extremely thematic and well designed. The cheap dorm feels like a cheap dorm. The frat house came right out of Animal House. The expensive sorority house feels like the sort of place a well-bred young woman would want to live. The object set is terrific and really shapes and sets the tone for the activities to come and the venues and houses in this new world.<br /><br />A Sim can go to the University at any time. The best time is after learning basic skills, since those skills shape how well a Sim does in college just as they shape how quickly a Sim advances in a career. Going to University can be expensive, but a Sim can get a scholarship by taking an aptitude test (thoughtfully dropped off upon entering game by a llama-costumed school mascot), which measures a Sims's traits and skills and determines how long the Sim will need to get a degree and how expensive the schooling will be. This evaluation is a neat bit of code that never fails to give me a thrill. There are several degrees a Sim can earn, each with its own schedule, study materials, and locations. While the Sim is in school, just as when that Sim's on vacation, the \"home world\" freezes in place, which isn't maybe so great, but I can see why it happens that way. A couple can go together, or one Sim can go alone. At the end you get a report card; you can't fail, but doing better gets you perks.<br /><br />This is not a world geared toward children. It's not specifically geared toward any other age except adults, specifically young adults, and the interactions are decidedly mature (allowing streaking, among other things, and \"juice\" pong). But that said, the object and CAS sets here are some of the best-realized in the TS3 franchise. This set seems like one of the most modern and au courant of the entire expansion library. The limited edition object, a statue that can be \"set\" to different types of costumes that any Sims present on its lot will try to emulate, is ingenious and charming.<br /><br />The new special objects include things like a bowling lane and a coffee counter, and to go with the coffee counter are new harvestables like various sorts of coffee beans and herbs (some fantastical, like Wonderpetal, and some real like cinnamon and chamomile). It's unfortunate that these new plants don't really interact much with the gameworld's existing expansions and base game; you can spice up dishes with herbs, eat the raw herbs, and throw them into a bonfire, and they'll give various effects to Sims who eat or smell them. Cinnamon, for example, makes a Sim more amorous and allows an interaction called a \"cinnamon kiss,\" and eating raw cinnamon has the same effect as the YouTube \"cinnamon challenge!\" Otherwise, though, there aren't new dishes based on these herbs and they don't figure into the alchemy system. Other special objects include a megaphone that can be used for anything from proclaiming the Sim's love, complaining about things, or demanding social change, a whiteboard that can be used to scribble ideas in meetings, a portable radio station, a skeleton for studying anatomy, a brain-scanner and science lab, and a gigantic group-science machine that has some interesting effects.<br /><br />The cell phone every Sim has is upgraded to a smartphone finally, with skins the Sim can earn over time; the Sim can use this phone to make a blog, too--and blogging is unbelievably fun. Blogs can go up to 5 stars based on readership size; they earn their makers money ingame and can eventually be sold for cash. Sims have a skill in Social Networking that they can use to make their blogs more popular more quickly, and this skill also figures in to another cute touch, a Sim Finder that works a bit like a dating-site profile to bring potential friends and lovers to your Sim's door. Also, every Sim now starts the game with an actual camera object so they can take \"real\" pictures rather than having to have World Adventures to obtain cameras and the Photography skill.<br /><br />One new versatile lot type is the new apartment residential lot that allows a Sim to have roommates. These roommates aren't under the player's control, but make life in the house more lively and entertaining and presumably lower the rent. To make things a bit easier, the player can specify who's allowed to pass through the house's doors so that a room can be kept private (so Sims don't wander in and out and hog the bed or amenities).<br /><br />And I couldn't finish talking about this EP without mentioning the new caste system. Your Sim can belong to any, none, or all of three new social groups: Nerds, Jocks, and Rebels. Each group is ranked 1-10 like skills are, and the further you go in each group, the more interactions you get. Rebels, for example, can \"show off a gizmo,\" Jocks can \"take a photo\" with friends, and Nerds can enthuse about comic books, among several other things each. When you get to level 10 in a caste, you are awarded an extra trait of your choice (YES!). Also, if you graduate well, you get another trait. So Sims can now have potentially up to 7 traits. YAY!<br /><br />In terms of mechanics, I bought the DVD copy rather than a digital download, so I can see how it runs on either the Mac or PC platform. It runs great on my PC. I waited until the 1.50 software update for Mac to install it there, and it seems to run just fine on the Mac too. I get error 12s on the Mac, but that's not really anything different. A Mac user with 4GB of RAM and maybe an older system (like mine) might do well to carefully consider how many expansions, Stuff Packs, and Store content is on the system first; when I tried to run University on my Mac when everything was installed (every EP and SP plus a slew of Store content), it barely even loaded a new game and almost immediately began throwing memory errors. I uninstalled almost everything (keeping only EPs with the exception of Late Night and Showtime since I knew I was unlikely to use those aspects of the franchise while playing on my Mac) and it's been all right since. So I'm going to say that there might be some serious problems running and using this expansion if a Mac user has too much other extra stuff in their build. In terms of age-appropriateness, I'd say upper teens and that parents need to exercise discretion; I can easily imagine that some parents might object to the more mature interactions.<br /><br />Overall, this is my favorite expansion. I definitely and heartily recommend it and consider it indispensable to my Simming experience.",

Laughably sad quality.\ntext: The foamy packaging material they put inside the plastic shell feels more protective than the actual product itself.  I think it is a bad sign when your \"protective case\" requires soft, foamy material to keep the case from getting broke in the mail.<br /><br />The case even sounds like the same material as those 2 piece plastic easter eggs when you grip your Switch tight in your hand with the case on.  I suspect this case will crack and break very easily if dropped or handled with much pressure.  It is sturdy when the top is down but if you accidentally put much pressure on it in your bag, expect no protection and a broken case.  It comes across very junky material.  And to add insult to injury:  it looks like my fingers are dipped in ink - that's how bad it holds on fingerprints.<br /><br />Another point of discontent, is that the top flipper is removable but the way it is removed is a joke.  You bend the extremely hard, brittle, slippery plastic cover and this dislocates two tiny little plastic pegs that comes out of the round holes they are stuck in.  It feels like it is going to break in my hands.<br /><br />In conclusion, I am hugely disappointed with the feature item of this set: the bonus items are the best part, as they are the parts I am not disappointed with.  This is one of those cases that shouldn't have even been made IMHO.  It feels like a dollar store item.  The control caps are hard to get on but I like them.  The gray matches the gray switch.  I am not going to try the screen protector because I am returning.  It feels like a decent screen protector.  The set is worth keeping if you need a screen protector and joycon thumbcaps (I notice those items are expensive here on Amazon but I don't think they should cost what they do).  I think you get a dispostable easter egg plastic case for free, basically, but I don't care to have the additional accessories enough to pay $12 for them.  Overall, if the set was $5 I would keep it for the screen protector and thumbcaps and use the case until I am sick of it.",

But for people larger than me, this is probably a good selling point they will fit much larger heads than most headphones I'm used to. and the harde plastic part won't touch, only the flexible band.",

            "question": "title: Lovely keyboard, worth considering.\ntext: [Note: I updated this review and changed rating to 4*, since I was mistaken about the lighting.]<br /><br />This was the first mech keyboard I tried, and I really liked the feel and responsiveness.  I was switching from a Logitech Wave keyboard, and found that the slightly smaller keyboard and different layout gave me a little trouble at first, but I began to adjust fairly quickly.  The Logitech G-Hub software is ok: in my opinion not quite as good as the Razer Synapse software in ease of use and configurability, but good enough.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the new GX keys do not allow the secondary characters on the keys (the symbols accessed by using Shift) to be illuminated.  So there I am, looking at brightly lit characters, and finding myself peering occasionally to be sure I'm hitting the right key for the shift character.  Maybe a perfect touch typist wouldn't care, but I need to occasionally look, especially when I'm typing the less frequent characters. (My understanding is that this is a limitation of most mechanical keys: only the upper part of the key can be properly lit, so the only solution is to have the two characters side by side at the top.)<br /><br />A minor flaw is the need to use two USB slots to plug in the keyboard, because one powers the pass-through USB slot. What? How is that useful?  I'd rather just use a separate USB cable or hub and have the option of using USB 3, multiple ports, etc. I think this is just dumb, although I know that many buyers want a pass-through no matter what.<br /><br />I ended up returning this one and switching to a Razer TKL with linear switches, which has even better responsiveness and feel, and is just a bit more convenient to position. And as I said above, I like the Synapse software better.",

            "question": "title: Exceeded Expectations!\ntext: When Sony first announced the Move controller, I'm sure everyone was scratching their head with questions like: Why bother, Nintendo already has this covered? What's with the glowing ball? Why the camera?<br /><br />Forgot all you've learned with the Nintendo Wii. I have the utmost respect for Nintendo for getting the motion control ball rolling, and I enjoy the Wii system for what it is, however, the motion control on the Wii is not all it's cut out to be. I'm sure like many of you, when you first got the Wii at launch, thought the motion sensor would track your every move. You couldn't wait to bowl, box, or swing a sword,  just like you would do in a real environment. The sad truth is, all of the wiimote's movement which \"talk\" to these games could easily be accomplished on your couch - even laying down. A simple flick of the wrist would translate to an on screen action. No need to stand up and bowl, why bother doing a full arm swing of your sword when it can be done without much effort on your part. In 2009, Nintendo released the Motion Plus add on for the Wii mote which certainly make it a lot more accurate, but not enough games support it just yet, and it still doesn't come close to what Sony has done.<br /><br />So what makes Sony's PS3 Move such a big deal? Well, for one thing, we're dealing with true 1:1 motion control. That funky glowing ball that was the brunt of many jokes happens to be the key to tracking your every moment; this, in combination with the PlayStation Eye. Once you begin to play any of the Move's games, you immediately sense you are not dealing with anything like the Wii. Not only does it sense anywhere in view your hand is, but it also detects how close or far you are to the TV.<br /><br />Sports Champions is amazing. The Table Tennis is so realistic, it's almost eerie. All the sports included are a blast to play (well, except for the Frisbee thing which I don't find interesting even in real life). Unlike WiiSports or Resort - you WILL work up a sweat because you will not get anywhere trying to sit in a reclining chair while the PS3 reminds you that your not in range. ;-)<br /><br />The other two games I've checked out were the EyePet and Start the Party. Both games use live camera feed, so now the player is inside the game! Yes, true augmented reality here folks. Your pretty illuminated  PlayStation Move Controller, suddenly becomes another object. Just look at the screen, you're now holding a Paint Brush, a tennis racket, or Ray gun! Folks, you have to see this to believe this. Yes, combining the player with the game's objects and its surroundings is another thing the Wii can't acheive.<br /><br />Overall, I'm so blown away by the Move's accuracy, The starting line up of games isn't much yet, but there's something for everyone and any choice will put a smile on your face. Plus, Sony and other manufacturers are already releasing patches to incorporate Move control into existing games like Resident Evil 5 Gold Edition, Tiger Woods 11 and much more. Oh, and loving the demo of \"The Shoot\" - can't wait for October. The system is very easy to set up -- and calibration is easy and super fast.",

            "question": "title: Seems to work well\ntext: I recently purchased a used Dreamcast that didn't have an AV cord and since I was hooking up to a modern TV, I knew that it would be better to be able to hook up via HDMI. This connector appears to be working well. It doesn't upscale the image, but it does output the Dreamcast's 640x480 VGA mode image through the HDMI cable. The image defaults to a stretched 16:9, but the TV I'm using has a button to switch to 4:3 which presents games in their original aspect ratio. 16:9 also works fine but the image will be stretched horizontally a bit.<br /><br />I've only used for a few hours, so I can't comment on longevity yet. The image is nice and crisp for an older console and it looks like it is sending out correct colors, etc.  Some sites online mention that there are some Dreamcast games that do not play nicely with the VGA output function, but everything I've tried so far looks pretty great. I'm not a retro gaming purist, so I can't say if this is the best way to hook up to a modern TV. For a simple solution to play some Dreamcast games on a newer TV, this feels like a good value for the 20ish dollars spent. I like that the adapter doesn't require any additional power to connect.<br /><br />Small update: the connection at the Dreamcast seems to be a bit finicky. If I plug it in right and don't move the Dreamcast, it seems to work just fine. If it gets jiggled at all, it either loses picture or keeps picture but causes only reds to transmit. I can't confirm if this is a problem with the adapter or the Dreamcast itself as I got the Dreamcast used and it is 23 years old now. It is not keeping me from enjoying the console, but I wanted to update to make sure buyers are informed.<br /><br />On a side note, Crazy Taxi is still a great game. I've had it in its re-released forms on PS3 and PC, but for both of those, they replaced the soundtrack. I'm not even a huge Offspring fan, but there is nothing like starting every run with \"Yeah, Yeah, Yeah....\"<br /><br />The Dreamcast=Pre-9/11=simpler times...",

I waited on a review to make sure that the wireless controllers all functioned properly, held their charge and could be played at all angles/distances up to 30ft from the TV and then some. To be on the safe side, I ordered one charge and play just in case one of the controllers went out during play. To date, it has not been needed. The controllers hold their charge just fine for all our gamers - and they tend to play up to 6 hours at a time. As to the quality of the controllers ... one was subjected to an English Springer Spaniel trying to use it as a chew toy and survived. Another was dropped on ceramic tile- when one player threw a fit- and showed no signs of damage. All 4 are still going strong months after use. I would definitely recommend going wireless for all families - especially if you have pets or young children running around that can trip on the cords. It's great for storing neatly away and not having to worry about cords being wrapped too tightly or getting tangled up. Amazon did have the best price at our time of purchase. I'm sure it's still the best deal now.",

I took this for granted, until I saw how other merchants packed their gear, which was just thrown into a box with barely any padding.<br /><br />FIRST IMPRESSION<br /><br />I didnt like the intro music. It deviated from the atmosphere created by prior Souls series starting from Demon's souls.  Didnt like the remake intro either. But Im used to it now.  There isnt much music in older Souls games. But what little it had, was perfectly suited to the world.  Elden rings, other than the intro, is no exception.  In Elden Rings, there is music almost all the time.  The compositions are perfectly suited for the world and paints a wonderful picture.  Beautiful with bleak and dark undertones.<br /><br />35 HOURS IN:<br /><br />Character creation- Alot of interesting possibilities including cosmetics, which wasnt much of a focal point in the past.<br /><br />Graphics- Top notch. Beautiful artwork.  The only issue is inconsistent 60FPS even in performance mode.  But not choppy at all.  Performance mode highly recommended. Quality mode looks good when standing still but otherwise I wouldnt use it.<br /><br />Gameplay- Dedicated Jumping on foot and horseback adds a vertical dimension to Souls games which makes it more interesting to play by giving more strategic options to tackle bosses and areas.<br /><br />Overworld- interesting and actually fun and not just mindless wandering unlike other games. Game gives you subtle directional clues to major areas of the game but still get to decide where you want to go.  I didnt realize this until 30 hours in as I wanted this to be a completely blind run and not reading any youtube videos.  Its easy to get around and many transfer/resting stations.  I usually dont like open world games because there is just alot of random filler/boring things to do.  But this game was truly an except for me.  I really enjoyed exploring on horseback.<br /><br />Dungeon/Castle combat- side areas are easy and straightfoward understandably but the major areas have the same souls like intricacy and detail.  Enemy/Boss AI is top notch and fun.  It can get incredibly difficult.  Just spend time on it and get to understand the timing and moves.<br /><br />Story- same as prior series. A bit sparse by todays \"standard\", but less so than prior Souls games. Still need to piece things together and use your imagination.  It takes a while for the story to unfold. Games/Movies today are often too verbose that it leaves little to the imagination.<br /><br />Difficulty- Easier than prior souls games.  It seems that they have more respawn/transfer stations, which makes backtracking and progressing easier.  Also, a much bigger stamina pool to start off, which means you dont have to raise this stat unless you want a tank/block build.  This makes the game easier in some sense.  In other Souls games you dont have to raise it either even if you played the glass cannon builds, but the stamina pools were smaller and so you had to be more offensively selective and strategic. There are also more clues as to where to go. The map is well done and interactive allowing you to pin areas of interest.  Also they give you summoning options in certain areas, which makes it easy for you to do damage while the npcs tank for you.  Works on many bosses. Not all.  You still have the option of summoning other players.<br /><br />I personally take it slow to soak it all in to enjoy this wonderful creation.  I try to avoid grinding/power leveling and collecting every little thing while playing unless Im stuck for a while.  Its fun figuring out how to beat bosses. Its part of the fun.  On difficult bosses, I usually spend one night dying over and over again, thinking through strats and then the next day I beat it rather quickly. Which makes me wonder why I couldnt do it before.  I find this a rewarding experience.  Usually im underpowered so my strats have to be perfect. But obviously there are ways around this by leveling up more or just coming back to that area later on after accumulating better equipment.",

I ended up getting it out maybe once or twice and the rest of the times I didn't even bother with it.  I also have friends who play Zelda BOTW and also like Amiibo and I would not get this Amiibo for them... so... I think the actual appearance of the Amiibo is too busy and hard-to-read.  And it's an awkward size/ shape compared to my other Amiibos.  So, maybe if it appeals more to you in the picture here and you just love Amiibos then this could be for you!  But it wasn't really for me and I kinda wish I'd bought another from the Zelda collection instead of this one.  I was lured in by the in-game item but it's too weak to care much about from my experience.  ^^;",

It's fun and except for a couple of sequences, not very challenging - maybe a good place for beginner Lego video game players. There are a couple of glitches in the game but not as many as in other games I've played.  I recommend that you see the movie first. Unlike some reviewers of the movie, I didn't read any religious messages into the experience - my choice - just good Lego fun. There is Lego violence (weapons used and bricks come apart) and mild profanity - if you call darny darn darn a profanity. Try to spot the Easter Eggs.

I just got this 2 days ago and I already love this keyboard. The sound and feel of this thing is extremely pleasant.<br /><br />At first I was thrown off by the depth you had to press the keys - I have been using a very shallow keyboard for years and it took about an hour for my fingers to get used to the &#34;throw&#34; of the keys. I learned touch typing on this style of keyboard and I love going back to the deeper keys. You don't have to press the keys all the way down for the keypress to register, but something about the pleasant &#34;clack&#34; of the key makes you want to complete each press.<br /><br />It is louder than I expected - but in a good way. The sound is pleasant, giving immediate sonic feedback to key presses. If you were in an open office, it might irk colleagues. It is odd but it makes you sound productive when you type.<br /><br />The light options are fantastic. The ability to set the brightness is great. I have it at the lowest setting - it is bright enough to see during the day and not glaring at night. There is space bar light bleeding - if you are far away from it. It might be annoying to others if you were sharing a dark office/lan party; though I doubt it. All of the LEDs work on mine (some people commented that they had lights out). The FN key and the F12 key LEDs are off on purpose - unless you activate them.<br /><br />I have a hard time imagining typing fast enough to have to modify the response time of the keys - but you can - giving 8ms, 4ms, 2ms, and 1ms options on the numpad.<br /><br />I use Linux. I was pleasantly surprised that the media control keys work for Amarok. The volume control keys don't seem to work; I am going to try to fiddle around see if I can't fix that.<br /><br />I had one major issue: the keyboard wouldn't work during the bios startup screen. I solved this issue by moving the keyboard to a different usb port. I believe it has to do with the read order of the usb ports - the bios activates the usb ports in order and a lower port is activated more quickly.",

I have a smaller (Drop ALT) and a larger (Drop CTRL) and this one is from a layout perspective better. The Gateron red keys are silent and VERY smooth. They are much smoother than the Cherry Silent Red I'm using in the two other keyboard, but not quite as quiet. There is a certain amount of movement in the stems as well and they don't feel as solid as the Cherry switches.<br /><br />The keycaps are decent but slighly cheap. I was hoping for better. Some of the hollow sound is coming from the keycaps. I tried solving the problem with my Drop cap set (Matt3o MT3 Susuwatari), but the problem is, that the Keychron keyboard has a fraction of a milimeter less spacing between the keys. Some of the keycaps touch and create a slight scratching/binding against each other. The overall with of the keys (e.g. from Caps Lock to Enter) is 2 or 3 millimeters less than the Drop CTRL, which means, there is overall a bit less space per cap. While I do like the Drop keycaps better (and they are much higher quality), I switched back to the Keychron caps since there is less binding with them.<br /><br />Overall this is a great keyboard, I just wish it would fit other keycap sets better, since this is the biggest weakness of the keyboard.<br /><br />Soundwise the keyboard sounds fine, the one complaint I have is the spacebar which is much louder than the rest of the keys. Slightly annoying, but I guess I'll get used to it over time. The configuration software is decent, but clumsy to use and doesn't recognize the keyboard, so a download of a JSON file is in order to unblock that.<br /><br />I do like the knob for volume control, alhtough I do realize that it is just a gimmick, with no actual value over using keys.",

There are lots of options for colors and patterns that all look really cool depending on your preference and you can change the speeds. You can also turn them off.

You can still hear distorted sound from it if you balance all the sound to that side, but it's basically a paper weight at this point.  The black pair remains functional when plugged directly into a headphone/mic port on a laptop.  But due to the physical vulnerability of headphone jacks we'd tried to use the boxed USB audio adapter that came with both sets.  As it turns out, the adapter began to send intermittent bursts of full blast audio into our listener's ears after being used for gaming and group calling.

            "question": "title: Just right price for the product, cool looking though\ntext: I think this mouse works just well as other mouse. So here is what I think about this piece.<br /><br />Build Quality and Design: It does have typical \"gaming\" gear outlook - exaggerated edges, black & red color theme (I don't know why all gaming \"something\" are always designed this way.)  The whole body is plastic, no silicone grips or something, yet there are stripe engravings on both side where you put your thumb and ring finger. The tip of the mouse (The upper middle art) is pretty sharp so it is lifted pretty well so I don't think it is very safe for young kinds as well.  There are off-sets here and there but we are talking about $10 mouse, so I think I should stop and move on.<br /><br />Functionality: It is quite responsive but I don't see much difference between this and my Logitech office mouse. Meaning, it works very well but nothing \"gaming\" nor \"giga-speed response\" in this. I am a mediocre gamer but not Faker, so probably I am not the right person to  review this part. The clicking sound is slightly louder than other mouse but not too bad. Overall, it works pretty nicely as other mouse does. It does have forward/backward red buttons on the left side of the mouse as well. Further,  you need to put 2X AAA battery which doesn't come with the product.<br /><br />Buy this if you want to : have mouse with \"gaming look\" without bleeding your wallet<br />Don't if you want to have: silent, safe and well designed mouse that you can use it for long time",

The game is made more difficult by having some of the hidden pictures in a darkened \"room\" and you have to search using a \"flashlight\" which only lights up the area around the cursor.  (For more fun, the game makes you find the battery for the flashlight in another room so you can only search the darkened rooms after you find the battery in another room.)  Interestingly, the game continues to come up with a different and challenging list of pictures to find no matter how many times I seem to be playing it.<br /><br />My 7-year-old child and I play with this, and both he and I absolutely love it so it's a good family game as well.

Thank god I didn't pay much for it. To start with, before they will let me play I have to join some stupid Social Club and give my email address - good luck spamming me on the email address I gave you Rockstar. Screw that. Then I had to wait for a patch even though I had only just downloaded it. After the patch was installed I got some bogus error message that I had no driver installed, so I restarted Steam. It took almost ten minutes from launch to actual game play. And I was barely getting 2fps with my processor pegged at 100%. The graphics aren't that great. I even dumbed down the resolution and textures to no avail. My graphics card is perfectly capable of handling anything I throw at it so I have to assume the bottleneck is my cpu. So we have to have a QuadCore to play this game. This sucks!<br /><br />Update: I loaded this onto my XPS QuadCore and it's playable although there is still noticable lag. If it ran well on a computer costing less that $1500 I'd give it three stars.<br /><br />It's still a bad port with major playability issues. Driving is very difficult with most vehicles having a turn radius larger than a four lane road. Moving in cover is awkward because the same key that is used to toggle in and out of cover is the same key that does special moves while in cover. Consequently Cole will sometimes come out of cover and run into the open while under fire with obvious results.<br /><br />The good graphics are reserved for the stars of the game - the automobiles. This is the best part of the game - seeing and driving these beauties. BTW, steal an ambulance for manouverability, steal a fire truck for fun.

Basically, you are an interior designer, working in your cousin's design shop.  Customers come in and ask you to change color schemes in their rooms, design lamp stands or flower vases, refinish furniture or frames, etc.  Or you might be painting a picture for someone's room.  Or moving furniture around to make a room more functional. You get to work a potter's wheel to make the vases and lamp stands. The game is very detail oriented. Overall....I like this game....and I think kids who are interested in interior design would like this game also.  The reason I gave this game 4 stars, is because some of the missions can be VERY tedious and difficult to figure out. I found it annoying when designing dressers/bureaus that each drawer had to be colored individually (maybe there's a shortcut to doing it that I just didn't figure out).  And I had a difficult time with some of the instructions for specialty designed walls/baseboards.  There are some assignments that will probably require some assistance from an adult to figure out (if this game is being bought for a 7-12 year old). But I would recommend getting the game used....it IS fun! :)",

You can plug the Optical cable into the USB dongle, plug that into the USB port, and go fully wireless.  Or you can use the enclosed audio cable plugged into the PS4 controller.  Both are easy to set up.  Both work.<br /><br />For the PS3, you need to plug the Optical cable into the USB dongle, plug that into the USB port, and then go monkey around with the settings until it finally works.  That one will work, but it is more of a pain.<br /><br />For the Vita, or any other media device, it should be simple.  You just plug the enclosed audio cable into the headphone jack, turn on the headphones, and you're good to go.  Only after a little while it says &#34;Automatic shutdown enabled.  Press the power button to cancel.&#34;  If you press the power button, it says &#34;Automatic shutdown disabled&#34;.  What it does after that is up to a coin toss.  It will either tell you it's powering off and then proceed to do so, or it will stay on.  I've yet to figure out the pattern.  I would have assumed that I did not press the button, or that it did not register, were it not for the audio prompt that automatic shutdown was disabled. I might have blamed it on the battery if it didn't happen less than an hour after a full charge, and right before staying on for an additional 45 minutes.<br /><br />It has little blue Turtle Beach logos on either side that glow red while the device is charging, blue when it is charged, and flashes blue when it is in use.  I would have preferred a stable light to the flashing, or even no light to the flashing.  If I can hear noise, I know it's on.  The flashing is just annoying.  It has separate volume controls for each earphones and microphone, and audio presets such as &#34;bass boost&#34;, &#34;bass and treble boost&#34;, &#34;vocal boost&#34; and &#34;natural sound&#34;.  I favor &#34;vocal boost&#34; for most games and videos, though some games sound better with &#34;natural sound&#34;.<br /><br />They are good for noise cancelling, and the sound quality is excellent.  In &#34;vocal boost&#34; mode, videos level (the voices are not drowned out by the special effects) which I very much appreciate.  Turtle Beach is known for excellent audio equipment, and the sound quality on this is flawless.  Were I judging it by sound alone, it would be five stars.<br /><br />The microphones attaches and detaches easily, for use as a gaming headset or just earphones.  There is a mute button on the right ear, that is quite easy to get to.  The buttons are spaced well enough, and distinctively enough, that they are easy to use while you wear the headset.<br /><br />They are comfortable when worn on the head, but when I wear them around my neck they get grabby with my hair, which is, for me, the biggest negative.",

I did notice some sound being off key in the first Sonic game BUT I didn't notice any game lag or slowdown....I like the speed of the Sonic games much better than on the PS2 compilation disc.  Of course, if you have the original system, stick with that.  If you sold yours long ago (like I did) or never had one, this is a good way to go.  I had no problem with the controllers after I positioned the system at a higher level on the coffee table by just sitting it on some stacked books.  The range is NOT great on the wireless part but you CAN plug in a controller if you have one...or two.  I had just one cart, Road Rash and it plays very good on this tiny little system. The system itself is not much bigger than that original cart and is ultra light weight.  This is about convenience of not having tons of cartridges laying around but it sure does play them nicely if you want to use them.  Is it the same quality as the original system?  No.  Is it effective?  Yes. I mean, really...are you going to devote the hours to retro gaming you did when it first came out?? If you ARE then you might want to find a really clean original system.  This is nostalgic fun to me and worth it if you find it for 50 or less.  Fun for parties or a play session here and there.

It is cool. But it's not that cool and suffers from some excessive cheapness. Oh, I love it and it now is where my Quest 2 lives, but let's go through this.<br /><br />The case - this can be found on Amazon for about half the price. Not the foam cutout mind you, but a higher quality metal carry case. I suspect you're mostly paying for the foam on this one because there's nothing special about the exterior case.<br /><br />So, paying for the foam let's look at picture #2 above - all the foam was glued into the case (what you have to do, I'm not complaining. All the foam at the edges looks like picture 2. Just not particularly neat. If you're going to charge $40 or so for foam work, make it neat.<br /><br />Unit comes with two keys to lock it. You can unlock with a fingernail. Handle connection just looks cheap.<br /><br />Positive: foam cutouts will keep your Quest 2 from moving. Negative: There's so much space they could have used to put things like booster batteries or a remote or just storage that was not cut out right. I mean sure this looks cool but rearranging the cutouts you would have had so much space free.<br /><br />This is the type of case I'd expect to pay half of what they're asking... It's lightweight aluminum, cheap locks and handles, and non-expertly glued foam.<br /><br />I do not hate it, I actually like it, but it's just cool looking, not cool functioning.",

I have had a wireless mouse in the past and I hated it, lots of random 'freeze' issues during FPS, heavy weight, didn't glide on surfaces well.  Not the case with this mouse.  No freezing or lag issues whatsoever, it is heavier than a wired mouse but it doesn't take long to get used to.  I don't game daily, however I do use the computer a few times a week.  I can tell you with using batteries built for digital cameras, in the 1 year I have owned this mouse, I am literally on the very first set of batteries for this device. I have never turned the mouse off in this time, it just idles. It's insane.  I have never replaced the batteries and every time I sit down I wonder if today is the day, and it never comes.  The battery life claims on this thing seem to be legit.<br /><br />The only downside is that my hand is a bit larger and with the grip I have, my thumb can't reach the furthest back button right above the thumb. If I try to hit it, I end up hitting another button at the same time, so I just unmap it.  Not the fault of the mouse, so I won't detract a star for it.<br /><br />If you are in the mood to switch from a wired mouse whether to cut the cord or replace an old mouse, I would recommend this mouse for sure.  My wife is a graphic designer and uses Photoshop on my gaming rig, and she doesn't mind it either, it's a good balance between gamer and useful.",

I wore mine out a week ago playing God of War 3 and I was originally planning on sending them to Sony for a replacement. The rubbers wear out on some Playstation 4 controllers that are first generation.<br /><br />Long story short, delivery was quick, and easy to install. My original were split in the center which created a &#34;lift&#34; on the rubber in the center that could be felt. I was skeptical at first, but after they arrive they fit perfectly. I removed the split rubbers from the old controller by hand. They come right off with no resistance or left over residue. Slide these sideways and they wrap around perfectly. They are slightly loose, but not overly and when playing they stay still. This was probably made that way so you could angle them in from any direction and then straighten them once on. They look nice and make the controller stand out. You could possibly add these on a controller that are not worn out like mine for extra grip.<br /><br />Pros: solid grip, they look nice once on, adding a little flare and originality to your controller. (i'll upload an image)<br />Cons: The only con I can find by being picky would be they can be ripped while putting them on the controller. This can be avoided by simply going slow and angle them sideways when installing. After in &#34;locks&#34; in one side, you can slide the rest on and pat it on the top so it slides under it.",

Since this is by Firaxis, who of course makes the Civ series, I decided to try it out.  Now I wish I had given it more attention before!<br /><br />The gameplay is incredible. There are basically two parts to the game. One where you manage your base, finances, etc and the other where you go on missions. The missions are all turn based where you hand pick the team you want to go on the mission and then tell them where to move and what to attack. It is very strategic and leaves plenty of ways to complete the mission.<br /><br />It is very challenging, even on &#34;normal&#34; difficulty, but it is very rewarding as well. Just remember to save often and you'll do fine.<br /><br />Overall, I think this game deserves all the praise it got and I can't recommend it enough if you like strategy/tactical games.",

            "question": "title: It is an interactive movie\ntext: I will start out with the apparently heretical statement that I was not a fan of the earlier final fantasy games. I am a big RPG fan, but please don't shoot, maim or otherwise attack me, because it is true. I found them all to be overly melodramatic, meandering, very predetermined, and frankly too much to sit through until the end. However, Final Fantasy X has hooked me.<br /> That is the great thing about the PS2. I have tried several games that never interested or whose predecessors have failed to entertain on my PC or the PS one. This game falls into this category.<br /> The major improvement is in the voicing and the movies. The story moves along with incredible cut scenes and plot exposition. No more reading along with out dated graphics and long load times. There is more room to wander for those of us who like the side quests. The battle system is much improved over the \"real time\" system, and now leads to more strategy and thinking during battles, not just fast paced button pushing and hoping for a good outcome. Yes, it is less realistic, but this is a game. The grid system for leveling up is major improvement, and you can spend considerable time weighing the pros and cons of each direction you can pursue and which locks to use up your key spheres on. Another place for fans of increasing the strategy.<br /> All in all, the game can be tailored to whatever the player prefers. It can be fairly fast if you plow strait through to the end and (like I did) feel that the prior games got a bit tedious, I did it in about 45 hours. But, you can spend days traveling around with the side quests and some get extremely hard, and I have not completed them all yet.<br /> To keep this short and not delve into all the technical stuff that most of us honestly don't care about, I will put it this way. The game is beautifully done, the right mix of gameplay and melodrama have been met, the controls are adequate and easy to learn, the strategy can become challenging, the music and movies are tremendous and the battle system is probably the best on the playstation 2.<br /> All in all, this is like watching an interactive movie. It is challenging enough for the adults and entertaining enough for the kids. For PS2 RPG fans it has set the standard.",

Once in Android mode it took a couple more tries to get this to pair with my Samsung tablet. Once paired I was in mouse emulation mode and could move the cursor around the screen but not select anything. I scanned their QR code in the manual to download 'Happy Chick' which I assumed was a freebie Angry Bird game giveaway. The first warning sign was the absolutely insane number of permissions the app required to install. Many I'd never seen or heard of. Once that was downloaded it turned out to be a downloading app from a non-US site where you could supposedly download games compatible with this controller. I then checked the Google and Amazon stores for any reference to GameSir and found nothing. Unwilling to download further software from both a site and country I didn't recognize I attempted to remove the 'Happy Chick' app from my tablet. While trying to find the listing (it was at the very end of the app list because it was named in English) I found several strange entries had been created that had names of other apps on the tablet in them. Those apps would immediately crash when tried to run from their original icons. I finally found and removed 'Happy Chick'. I had to restart my tablet twice before the almost dozen affected apps would run properly again. Once I had things running properly and the controller was still paired with the tablet I tried several different game apps and the controller worked with none of them. I unpaired the controller, made sure it was off and tossed it into the garage awaiting next week's trash pick-up. I should have stopped the moment I saw the page after page (I think I had to 'continue' four or five times to reach the end of the list) but I wanted to trust this company but I'm not installing any further apps or software from sites I don't know in countries I'm unsure of.

            "question": "title: An OK Product\ntext: First of all I have to say I don't know why some people are confused about how many screen protectors come in this package. It comes with two. Not two of each, two total-- one for the top, one for the bottom. You also get a cleaning cloth and a \"Soft Card\" which I assume is to get the air bubbles out, but it doesn't say. Works well for that anyway.<br /><br />I was a little curious as to why it did not come with instructions, but I guess the process is easy enough to figure out.<br /><br />I used the cleaning cloth to get the DS screens clean. I peeled the backing off the top protector and laid it on the screen going from one side to the other, smoothing the air out as I laid the film down. I used the \"soft card\" to push the air out from the edges of the screen. I was satisfied with how it looked.<br /><br />Then I did the same for the touch screen. Despite thinking I had laid the protector on perfectly straight, one of the corners did not fit exactly. I pried the screen up with my fingernail and peeled it off. This was my BIG MISTAKE. Pulling the film off resulted in so much static that very small fibers were attracted to and stuck to the film. Unfortunately since the backing is covered in adhesive (as opposed to being a static cling), it was impossible to remove the very fine particles that were now stuck to the protector. I did not notice this, however, until I laid the protector back down on the DS. Where ever a piece of fuzz was, an air bubble had formed around it and I was unable to push the air out.<br /><br />The bubbles were VERY noticeable on the dark screen of the DS when it was not turned on. When playing a game however, the bubbles were hardly if not at all noticeable.<br /><br />The next day I decided to pull the bottom protector off and rinse it under the sink. I used a dab of soap and rubbed very lightly. I expected the adhesive might get ruined in the process but it doesn't appear to have been. I was able to wash the majority of the big fuzzies off. Reapplying the film showed improvement, but there are still one or two small bubbles. I can live with it though.<br /><br />In conclusion ...<br /><br />- make sure you wash your hands and clean the screen very well before applying these things. You might consider using a higher quality cleaning cloth that absolutely will not shed.<br /><br />- once it's down, DO NOT pull the protector up again (with the intention or reapplying it).<br /><br />- applying the screen slowly and firmly, going in one direction will eliminate most air bubbles.<br /><br />Three stars out of five. An OK product. I have had no sensitivity problems, and I just hope it does its job!",

            "question": "title: I really wanted to love this game, but I just couldn't.\ntext: First off, I am a big Assassins Creed fan. I especially loved the Ezio franchise due to the story, the awesome gameplay, and the fact that Ezio himself was such a bada$$. I beat all of the Ezio games within a week because I was so eager to finish the story.<br /><br />Then, AC3 came out. I was very excited to continue the story. However, I was disappointed and here is why:<br />-Connor is boring. I'm sorry to put it so bluntly, but it is the truth. He bores me. There is nothing exciting about him at all. When it came to Ezio, he at least made me feel like a true Assassin. With Connor, however, I just don't get that same feeling because his character is so dull.<br />-There is too much running around! I swear, I can't tell you how many times I had to literally run, and run, and run some more to get from point A to point B. You are slowed down by so many things too, such as a mountain range. I will be running in a straight line, but then bam there is a mountain in my way and I have to figure out a way around it.<br />-Too many cut scenes. I enjoy cut scenes, but not when they are as excessive as this game is. I feel like I'm watching a movie with the amount of heavy cut scenes they added to this game.<br />-The story is on the dull side. I get bored to the point where I stop paying attention anymore.<br />-I feel as though all I do is fight those guards at times. It's fun at first, but it loses it's appeal quickly. You can only fight so many guards before it gets repetative and therefore boring. The older games, such as AC2, were not anywhere near this bad when it came to the guards. The guards chased you down in the older games, but it was not as excessive as AC3 is.<br />-Most importantly, this is the FIRST AC game that I put down and have yet to finish. I do plan to finish it one of these days for the sake of the story line, but the game is just such a big disappointment that I can't pick up the controller just yet. In time I will, but I need a break from this terrible game.<br /><br />It saddens me to leave a bad review. I gave it 3 stars only because it is an AC game and it is fun to a very small extent. I do like to know what happens in the story too. Other than that though, it's just not a super fun game like the others before it.",

            "question": "title: Red Dead Redemption PS3\ntext: For me, GTA was a fun series a few years ago, but I had dropped out of it since it seemed to be getting too repetitive & too similar. So, I was super-excited when I heard they were making Red Dead Redemption, but then disappointed when the release date kept getting pushed back. Thankfully it has been worth the wait!<br /><br />The missions for the most part are good & action-packed. Generally they involve shooting a lot of bad guys, who are all displayed with red dots on your map. The red dots make it easy to find them/ count how many are left to shoot. A few of the Bonnie missions are dull, slow, boring and involve general farmhand stuff, but thankfully that's pretty early on in the game.<br /><br />Something as mundane as riding around in the desert from town to town is actually fun. The scenery is beautiful and epic. I can waste hours just riding around the countryside helping people out, hunting down escaped prisoners, or hunting animals. The hunting aspect is surprisingly fun & addictive, and hunting is a very entertaining way to rack up some money if you need it.<br /><br />Normally side games are lame and not-interesting, but here in RDR - Poker, Blackjack, Liar's Dice, Horseshoes, Arm Wrestling - are fun and pretty realistic. Liar's Dice is a game I'd never heard of before, but it's really fun, and I think would be a great drinking game with friends.<br /><br />For my first play-through, I've been trying to be as honorable as possible, but occasionally an innocent bystander will get whacked (sorry about that). Another thing to note is that you can't use cheats in this game if you want to save & progress on the storyline. I haven't found the need, though, to cheat like in GTA with full ammo, full health, reduce wanted level, etc. If you are interested in the cheats, search online for more details.<br /><br />For some people who complained that the targeting was difficult, if you double-tap the L2 button, the game does a great job of locking right on to the target - actually almost too good of a job. There is no overall easy/medium/hard Difficulty setting on this game. I'm generally so-so at video games, especially as I'm now in my 30's and can't devote hours-upon-hours to gaming like I did in college. Thankfully RDR is not a throw-down-the-controller-because-you're-so-angry difficulty. In fact, if you're a hardcore gamer, you might think it's too easy (?).<br /><br />I haven't touched the online multi-player yet. The single player is so engrossing right now, and I'm generally not a fan of online shooters - and also because I suck at them. So if you are really into that genre, you're probably better off sticking to Call Of Duty or Battlefield 2. I assume most people aren't buying this game for multi-player though.<br /><br />For a few of my negatives, the cut-scenes are slow-moving. The talking & overall flow of them just seems so s-l-o-w. I wish there was a double-time option for it. But you can skip them altogether, and then review the dialogue in the journal later if needed. Also, I wish you could just press select to get to the Map instead of having to go through Start -> Map. I've only had the game lock up on me once; once isn't bad, but glitch-free would be ideal.<br /><br />Also, I'm a big fan of customizing your character, or better yet, creating your own guy altogether. I wish we'd have had that option in this game. As it is now, you can really only change your outfits as you unlock them. A huge Rollie Fingers mustache would be an awesome choice.<br /><br />For the full price of admission, I am definitely getting my money's worth on Red Dead Redemption. It is literally hours-upon-hours of fun. I have been staying up way too late playing RDR, which unfortunately leads to a rough time going to work the next morning! Highly recommended.",

The AI is still just as terrible and the commentary is the exact same thing as the previous games, such as when Lon says \"Here comes the flop\" is followed by Norman Chad's \"That's what my wife said on our honeymoon\"  Even the players say a lot of the same phrases as the previous two games.<br /><br />I think the best part about the game is that is has a lot of pros that you will recognize such as Chris Ferguson, Phil Hellmuth, Devilfish, Phil Gordon, etc. etc.  But to me, this was pretty much the only good part of the game.<br /><br />I was surprised to see people still playing online, though it is rather empty.<br /><br />If you are just learning how to play, this MAY be a good game for you.  However, I would recommend signing up for a free account on one of the many poker sites that are out there and learning the game with play chips (same goes for players who are proficient players..  I'd stick to online)<br /><br />I gave the game 3 stars only because of all of the pros the game has..  Other wise I would've given it a 1.5 or 2.",

Bass response isn't enhanced, so it seems to have a \"flat\" audio spectrum, which can be a good thing if you're an audio purist. A flat spectrum is also an advantage when it comes to hearing dialog and chat, whereas enhanced bass can make everything sound woofy. If you're looking for a lot of bass, I'd rate these as a 6 out of 10 in that area.<br /><br />The ear pieces are comfortable and full coverage but don't completely shut out the outside world. You can still hear some ambient sounds. The automatic adjustable fit is excellent.<br /><br />The mic is inconspicuous and easily moved around. The lighting is a bonus but only operates when connected via USB.<br /><br />The only negative is the volume adjustment knob has a budget feel, kind of like a toy, but it works fine.

            "question": "title: UPDATE 11/5/17 - STILL My new favorite game as of 3/8/17 - 5 stars - WITH SPOILERS\ntext: This is a great game--my new favorite.  I have to give it 5 stars overall.  The scenery is probably the best I've personally seen on the PS4.  The weapons and equipment are pretty realistic, in my opinion.  I just recently stopped playing Metal Gear Solid 5 after playing that and nothing else over the last 9 months.  I believe this game is like Far Cry 4, GTA 5, MGS 5, and Fallout 4 all wrapped into one (with a little imagination).  I own all those games for PS4, and I believe this game takes most of the best elements from the others mentioned above.  The sheer number of vehicles and weapons and equipment is amazing.  There are some significant pros and cons to this game, however.  In no particular order, I don't agree with being able to switch to any weapons that have been unlocked whenever I feel like it.  I'm not carrying all my unlocked weapons with me at all times--that would be extremely cumbersome.  For the fun factor, tho, it is great.  My favorite sniper so far is the MSR.  I don't have the 50 cal unlocked yet, but I'm told it can even shoot down the Apache helicopter with 1 shot.  My favorite machine gun is the M249.  Nothing stands up to the 249 except the &#34;Apache&#34; Unidad helicopter, which incidentally looks almost exactly like a Cobra helicopter.  I was carrying a bullpup assault rifle with a grenade launcher, but that pales in comparison now to the damage the trusty M249 deals out.  I'm still using the standard 45 caliber pistol.  I use everything suppressed except the 249.  I absolutely HATE that (at least on Arcade level) I cannot drag off the bodies of enemies I've killed.  I believe that should have been implemented into this game.  I loved that on Far Cry 4.  As for the Unidad, I think it's total BS that I can shoot down a gazillion Unidad helicopters, obliterate hordes of Unidad soldiers, and destroy lots and lots of Unidad vehicles, and they just keep coming and coming and coming--and then they kill me.  I have pushed the Unidad alert level to LEVEL 4 on several occasions, just to see if I could kill them all.  Even on Arcade level, I can't kill them all.  Another thing that is hokey is a minivan should not be able to go up an almost vertical mountain.  It is fun, tho.  The vehicles take an extreme amount of damage before they blow up, generally.  In real life (which I realize this is a game), I would not be able to take a Lambo-looking sports car cross-country and run over cactus after cactus and smash into stone walls, etc, etc, etc, without totaling the thing out in the first crash.  I LOVE the sync-shots.  It really helps with the stealthy sniper approach.  When all else goes to hell, tho, I bring out the M249 and get to work.  I really like being able to upgrade weapons, as with Fallout 4.  I like stopping vehicles and pulling people out and taking their cars as with GTA5.  The scenery really reminds me a lot of MGS5 and FC4.  Not surpising, considering who produced this game.  What I really, really, really like about this game is it IS fun.  I have probably spent 30 hours playing so far, and it has gone by like a snap of my fingers (almost).  And, I'm just on the very easiest level.  I am going to have to get a lot better at this game to even think about upping the difficulty level.  The AI on this game is really pretty good.  My AI soldiers, as in my 3 teammates and the rebel soldiers, are really pretty good.  They have senior moments on occasion and can't figure out where to go, but for the most part, they are right there beside me or at least very close in a gunfight.  The enemy soldiers AI reminds me a lot of MGS5.  One shot unsuppressed (and sometimes even suppressed), and they have my location, and they are coming for me and my team.  I hate the SAM missle sites.  I have gone in and wiped them out in order to steal an aircraft only to discover that there was another SAM missile launcher in range that enjoyed shooting me down.  Flares would have been a nice touch to be able to drop out of an airplane or heli,  I am going to try switching seats with another player and try decoying an incoming missile with a flare gun, but I bet it won't work.  But I am going to try it if I can line everything up.  I have gotten stuck in the map 3x so far.  Each time, I have fallen down into a crevice somewhere, and the only way I could get out was to fast travel out.  That used to happen to me in Skyrim back in the day.  But for the miles and miles or km and km of map this game has, I suppose I can excuse a couple glitches here and there.  I'm pretty sure this is operator error, but I am not good at base jumping yet.  I've got it figured out how to jump out of a heli or an airplane, tho.  The parachute is really cool.  There are a ton of different vehicles available.  I hardly have to walk anywhere, but I do it just to try to discover everything on the map.  Usually everywhere I go there is lots of ammunition available, which is nice.  Not sure how realistic that is, but it makes the game more fun.  I don't like how I have to stand directly in front of the ammunition crates in order to re-load ammo.  Same thing goes for the supply tagging.  It seems like I have to be right in front and touching each crate in order to load or tag.  When doing air-to-air combat, it is difficult for me to fly a heli and shoot the guns all at the same time while still trying not to get shot down.  Luckily, my guys out on the sides of a small heli do a lot of shooting, and they take out a lot of enemies while I perform my &#34;circle of death&#34; going around and around a target.  I'm sure some company will come up with a game better than this in the future, but for now, this game is the bomb.  5 stars.<br /><br />*** UPDATE 4/3/17 ***<br /><br />I still love this game.  I'm level 28 now.  I've unlocked a lot of cool weapons and gear.  My favorite loadout is still the MSR in the sniper slot, M249 in the light machine gun slot, the P45T in the pistol slot, and the standard drone.  For destroying vehicles and especially that pesky Unidad &#34;Apache&#34;, I do switch to the HTI for a 1-shot kill.  I have been using the explosive drone a lot for taking out SAM sites and generators.  Some of the bases are almost impossible to get into, and the explosive drone really helps on occasion.  For example, there is a Serpentidad (or something spelled close to that) in the bottom center of the map.  It is crawling with Unidad.  It also has a SAM site and a generator.  Blowing up the generator opens all the gates, and destroying the SAM site helps with a mission underneath it on the map in order to steal a +3000 medical supplies helicopter.  I had to attempt that mission 3 times to get it done.  I got shot down 2x, and then I figured out that the SAM launcher was in that Unidad base.  So, I had to take out the SAM site first in order to not get blasted out of the sky by missiles on the 3rd (and successful) attempt.  So far, the SAM launchers and Unidad are my worst enemies.  I can't say for sure how many, but I think I shot down about 15 Apache helicopters one time when I was discovered sneaking around the Unidad base after I had released all the prisoners out of the prison.  It is ridiculous how many soldiers and land-based vehicles and helicopters spawn almost immediately after the previous units have been destroyed.  They just keep coming and coming, in waves LOL, and the only way I have found so far to get the Unidad alert down from 4 stars is to run and hide somewhere that Unidad cannot find me.  Eventually, they give up, but it takes a really long time to outrun Unidad.  I have still been playing on the easiest level so far since beginning the game.  I have discovered almost everything on the massive map, but I still have a long, long way to go before I can finish the game.  I also think it is a bit unfair for me to spot and mark targets with my drone and my AI crew somehow targets them and can wipe them out with a single shot, sometimes even thru what appears to be solid walls.  My recommendation is to get the MSR, HTI, M249, and the explosive drone as soon as possible.  I also think that the fastest revive skills and best binocular skills are a must.  The binoculars are very handy maxed out for when drones are jammed.  I have now seen videos where the streamer uses the EMP drone almost exclusively to take down road convoys.  I haven't done that yet.  I usually just assault the escort vehicles from the air and then land next to the truck and loot it.  From the ground, I usually shoot up the rear escort vehicle and then run the other 2 vehicles off the road and loot the truck.  I love the helicopters for close air-to-ground combat.  I fly, and the AI teammates shoot the crap out of everything once I give the order.  I'm thinking I may start playing online, but I haven't done it yet.  I'm thinking that human teammates will probably do better than the AI.  BUT, the AI teammates are very good, in my opinion.  The AI enemies are almost always very good.  A couple times the AI teammates and the AI enemies have gotten stuck around vehicles or other obstacles, but usually they are very, very &#34;smart&#34;, sometimes too smart, especially when I get surprised by an enemy AI it seems that way.  I've gotten stuck in the map a couple more time and have had to fast travel out.  Not a huge deal, but a minor irritation.  Even when I happen to get KIA and re-spawn fairly close to the mission objective, I hardly ever do it the same way the second (or third) time around.  It just seems like the AI soldiers surprise me sometimes by taking different routes, especially in the cities.  At a fixed location, like a &#34;steal an airplane&#34; mission, they are pretty much in a concentrated area, but they do walk around a lot sometimes, and if they are alerted, they will come looking for me.  I absolutely hate the &#34;X&#34; being the machine guns on my helicopters setup.  The way I fly, I don't think I can (or will) change the button to control the fixed guns on helicopters.  It is a huge pain in the butt to shoot missiles or fixed guns.  In order to shoot from anything other than head-on, I have to tip the nose of the heli way down in order to shoot down from any significant height to engage targets on the ground.  I believe I have crashed my helis several times because I was pushing too many buttons and manipulating the joysticks on my PS4 controller all at once.  I love (and hate) the bullet drop on the weapons.  I don't think there is too much side wind pushing on the bullets, but there is definitely bullet drop for many calibers once I'm shooting over 200m.  I like this so much better than Far Cry 4 in that respect.  The game is still really fun for me, and I'm going to keep playing it until I'm tired of it.  5 stars remains!<br /><br />*** UPDATE 11/5/17 *** with SPOILERS<br /><br />Still my new favorite game.  I've discovered some glitches with the game since the last patch, but overall the game is still very good.  I finished the game for the 2nd time on EXTREME/TIER ONE Level 19 when Karen Bowman shot El Seuno a few times and finished him off.<br /><br />The good:<br /><br />TREMENDOUS improvement in the helicopter controls over the &#34;classic&#34; controls.  In my experience, I can't play the game on the hardest level (EXTREME) and Tier One without using armed helicopters.  If you haven't learned how to fly helicopters, you'd better learn.  I need them and so do you, especially to take out the armed convoy escorts.  I've almost perfected the takedown of all convoys.<br /><br />I like the realism that comes along with the helicopters.  It seems like the wind and rain have an effect on flying.  I also like that my helo doesn't slide down the fing mountain now every time I land at a slight angle.<br /><br />Along with Tier One came the HTI BDC Desert Camo, etc, etc, etc, on STEROIDS, lol.  I maxed it out to Level 15.  Nothing else even comes close.  This 12.7 / 50 cal sniper is an absolute MUST.  I also leveled up my ACR to Level 30.  It is the best assault rifle for me.<br /><br />I also like the ballistics of each rifle in the respect that I have to compensate for elevation on all rifles, and windage and elevation on moving targets.  No more putting the crosshairs on a target 500m away and headshooting him every time.  I think this last patch improved on the distances targets are visible thru the high-power scope.  My longest shot has been 795m.  I've seen on the internet where somebody made a 1200m shot?  On my PS4, I can't even see an enemy that far out, so that shot must have been on a PC, I think anyway.<br /><br />The bad:<br /><br />One shot (even suppressed?) and everybody in the world knows exactly where I am?  I'm calling BS on that one.  I haven't gotten stuck in the map lately, but today when I was transferring El Cardinel from a 4-door sedan to a helicopter, the game wouldn't let me cross some terrain.  Really pissed me off.  I had to put EC back into the car, drive the car right up to the helo, and then take him out of the car and stuff him into the helo.  Good thing no Unidad or SBC were around or I would have gotten smoked.  Still pissy about wave after wave after wave of SBC and Unidad that miraculously appear from thin air to fight me with soldiers and vehicles and never seem to run out.  Still hate the SAM launchers.  I have found that I can land close but still out of range and blow the SAM launchers up with Explosive Drones or C4 or grenades.  Once you blow up a SAM launcher YOU CANNOT GET SHOT DOWN AND REVIVED, or the SAM launchers will miraculously re-appear--fully intact and ready to shoot you down.  It is amazing how quickly a bunch of soldiers and drug dealers can rebuild a complicated piece of machinery like that...  The only way I have found to defeat the SAM launchers is to blow them all up (there are 3) that surrounded the area where the mission was to &#34;Open the Bank Vault&#34;.  I used an armed helicopter to fly in and out of that area after I took out the 3 SAM launchers in the vicinity (and never got shot down or revived).  It is almost impossible to defeat the hordes of soldiers unless you have an armed helicopter, did I mention that?  The little SBC white helicopter with machine guns is the best one.  The one with rockets is OK if the targets are (and they are rarely) stationary.<br /><br />Still a great game, and I have been playing it and nothing else for almost 8 months.  I am going to keep playing it until I find something better.  Far Cry 5 is supposed to be coming out 2/27/18, so I'm sure I will need to be playing that when it arrives.<br /><br />I paid about $60 when this game came out.  Now it is about 1/2 that.  If you like an intense action shooter where you can drive and fly and deal out massive amounts of destruction, you owe it to yourself to play this game.  The harder levels require some careful planning to get thru the missions.  No more smash and grab with brute force.  The hardest missions for me were the ones where I had to remain undetected.  If you like strategy/careful planning (sometimes) to go along with your mayhem, this is the game.  Buy it and plan on spending a lot of hours playing it.  5 stars remains.",

I love wireless VR but the benefit of this is you will never run out of battery charge as it don’t use batteries. I use it from bed to play games and media and don’t have to worry about that.<br /><br />As far as people reporting that it looks blurry well that’s not caused by the headset, it maybe be a fact that some people may have myopia (nearsighted) and never new about it. I have myopia so if I used this device without my glasses in then it will obviously look blurry. So when I put on my glasses it’s perfect.<br /><br />My wife on the other hand does not have nearsightedness so when she uses them she says it’s razor sharp even more so than our large screen tv she says. Tidbit all VR are designed to have the sharpest part of the image towards the center as that’s how human vision works we see in a 120 degrees arc. But most of that arc is peripheral vision so most of what we can see in total focus is towards the center of our vision, same goes for VR.<br /><br />Anyway with this I enjoy best of both worlds wired, and wireless with my other devices.<br />I also plan to get Oculus Quest, but this psvr can handle full featured games and not just VR experiences.<br /><br />I can’t help it, I’ll review the psvr in two parts.<br />Okay 1st part and at a later time I’ll review the vr experience as I got the headset ahead of my ps4 arrival.<br /><br />Okay let me make this clear, as of now I’m using the psvr on my Xbox One as a monitor for media and Xbox one games<br />until I get my PS4.<br /><br />I own both the Samsung VR and Oculus Go and can assure you even with my myopic eyes I can see that this looks far better than either the Samsung Vr or Oculus Go without a shadow of doubt! And I don’t have to worry about the other headsets having to charge batteries ever again!<br /><br />Let me tell you something...<br />I would get this just for media use alone for fact!!<br />Okay now the comfort of this device can’t be matched, it’s so darn comfortable comparing to my other devices,<br />I’m shocked how comfortable it is! They nailed it they put lots of TLC into this!<br />The build of the headset and the cushion pads are fantastic!<br /><br />I don’t know what other people are doing wrong with a bad experience with it, because I am more than pleased with it, and should have gotten it sooner !<br /><br />Thanks Sony!<br /><br />Not comparing with other high end pc vr units, I’m speaking specifics about Samsung Vr and Oculus go and fact is this is way better nuff said!",

I have always loved the keyboard, because it’s so customizable, but have hated the lack of keycap backlighting for the uppercase symbols.  I’m a touch typist, but have a bad habit of peeking at the number keys to get the uppercase symbols.<br /><br />As you can see from my photo, these keycaps solve the problem.  By placing the number and symbol labels side by side at the top, both are properly backlit.  You do have to remember that the label on the left is for the lower case (usually a number) key, but that’s easy to do.<br /><br />It’s too bad that the keycaps for the BlackWidow Ultimate keyboard weren’t designed like this in the first place.  The box of keycaps comes with a keycap puller, as well as with stabilizers for the larger keys.  The instructions are very easy to understand, and swapping out the keycaps is a simple job.",

They were very easy to apply; I'd forgotten to use the cleaning towelettes provided for the first application but in the end I never needed it.  No bubbles, easy application, piece of cake.  The package contains a microfiber cloth and a stiff cardboard credit-card-sized smoothing card as well as two packs of wet-and-dry cloths; there is also a strip of hinge-stickers but it indicates right on the front to not use this on the Switch, so I did not use them.  If the seller is reading this, a couple suggestions: 1) It would be great to include some Switch-compatible tape strips in future versions of this product, because in my experience applying screen protectors, that is an invaluable step for a bubble-free application. And 2) you may want to consider converting the smoothing card from cardboard to a plastic product as the latter would have worked a little better for smoothing, if needed; the cardboard card bent a bit under my attempts to de-bubble.  It all looks great now, so these are suggestions for future improvements on this package.  Finally, I had some issues registering my product for their lifetime warranty, and reached out to their customer support team, who responded speedily (thank you Stephanie!) and were very helpful for my issue.  Great product and I will add this vendor to my list of preferred suppliers for screen protectors in the future for my tech-heavy family.",

It's more like Evil Genius and a tycoon game mixed with a novel approach to tower defense. While you're trying to build the coolest dungeon so that you can earn back your reputation as head of the Dungeon Lords, you attract a number of different heroes. However, you're not trying to kill them,  you just want to \"fatten\" them up a bit, and all the hero classes expect something different to be entertained. Only once they are plump with entertainment (soul energy) should you trap them in your prison to maximize your return, allowing you more resources to build an even cooler dungeon. Most of the action is hands off, which you placing spawn points and trusting to your monsters and good dungeon design to keep the adventurers in your dungeon long enough to be captured, but often  you have to jump in and directly control your Dungeon Lord, who is a tough fighter in his own right. The graphics are beautiful, the story is funny, and the assaults on your dungeon are challenging. I do wish I would have a bit more direct control over the monsters to send them to intercept heroes, but this isn't a real time strategy game after all.",

The rest is a stand alone game that I would definitely buy expansion packs for.  I am so glad that the create a sim feature created sims that looked realistic.  Unlike Sims 3 these Sims actually look attractive.  I was a little worried about how to provide all of the needs for my sims plus complete the quests plus do my daily responsibilities.  EA must have read my mind and narrowed it down to hunger and sleep.  Plus your daily responsibilities are only two tasks which gives you time to focus on your quests.  If you are looking to build your own buildings and change them at will, you will be disappointed.  I myself never really cared about that feature so when I selected a barracks and POOF! there it was and fully furnished, I was delighted.  I've only played about four hours, but so far I love it.  It is new, and refreshing and I must add that my knight I created is quite handsome. :)<br /><br />Ok so I originally submitted my first review after only 4 or 5 hours of gameplay.  Sorry to say I had to drop my initial rating from 4 stars to 2.  Why?  Well I've had this game one week and well, I finished it.  Yep, completed the kingdom in one week.  It wouldn't be so bad if I had completed all the quests and all my heroes were maxed out right?  Nope.  My blacksmith was level 1, didn't get to play him at all.  My bard was level 6 and my spy was level 4.  None of my heroes got to level 10 AND I didn't get to put all of the buildings in place either.  I still had two more buildings to put in.  *SPOILER* What is with the last quest?  I'm told make a crew and some builders and use one of my main heroes to lead them to a new kingdom, they get on a ship and disappear.  Buh bye main character, hope you saved them because they are gone permanantly.  EA I feel cheated.  I didn't get to do all the quests, my heroes didn't get to level up all the way AND one of my main characters disappears permanantly!!!

The swappable shell is nice and sturdy. Doesn't feel cheap at all. You basically get a sensei type shape, or a flatter viper mini shape. I preferred the Sensei shape. Over time, the shell began to creak a little bit. It doesn't really bother me, but I know some people really hate that kind of thing.<br />The feet are fantastic. Very smooth and clean.<br />The clicks are awesome- well, the main mouse 1 and mouse 2 clicks. The clicks are sturdy and satisfying. The side mouse buttons are alright. Nothing special, but not noticeably worse than other other mouse I use. The scroll wheel... this ones tough. Basically, the actual scroll is one of the best I've experienced. It's smooth but tactile enough to be pleasant and discernable, but the click of the scroll wheel takes a noticeable amount of force. Like, I really have to think about it when I push the thing down. It's a big reason that the mouse isn't my main mouse.<br />Lastly, the cable is ok. It looks cool on the retro version of the mouse, but it's heavy and it is felt whenever I move the mouse, even in a bungee.<br /><br />TLDR;<br />Great M1 and M2 clicks<br />Passable side button clicks<br />Tough scroll wheel click but satisfying scroll<br />Great feet<br />Good shell shapes with a bit of creak over time<br />Cable is... ok.

The grips made it easier to hold for longer periods of time, but after only a little bit of use kids decided it was just easier to use the smaller controllers.

The sound works well on the new unit and the mic has a really impressive pickup range. I also realized that you can adjust the placement of the shark fin, and rotating it a bit made the earbuds fit a little better (especially the left one which is weighed down by the mic). It comes with a clip to secure the cord to clothes, etc. but the length of the cords makes that a bit awkward. I ended up clipping the individual cords through it just above the volume controller which works okay but is still not ideal. While not perfect, these now work pretty well for me so I have increased my rating accordingly.<br /><br />Original review:<br />The color (blue) was nice, but nothing else about these was. The shark fins were too large for my ears so the fact that it comes with different size ear pieces was irrelevant since there is only one size fin. The braided cord material seemed to snag on my clothes because it wasn't smooth/slick enough. The sound quality did not seem good but I don't know if that was because I had a bad unit or because I could not use them as intended. Maybe these would be fine for someone with larger ears and that is more stationary, but I bought these to use with my phone when walking around (when a full sized headset would look silly--too many comments from my family about looking like I should be directing airplanes) and they did not work for that purpose.",

The campaign mode is challenging, and fun. Online mode is where I spend most of my time now that I have finished the campaign. I love the hacking invasion of another player. It’s a lot of fun to mess with people by blowing stuff up, sending gang members after them etc. My only complaint though is a big one. The online play frequently locks up and actually causes my Xbox One X to shut off! This happens about 20% of the time. I’ve reached out to Ubisoft, but they have no response other than reinstalling the game, which isn’t the problem. It ONLY locks up when playing online through their Ubisoft servers. Watch dogs 1 did not have this issue, and checking the forums, I am far from alone, yet Ubisoft refuses to release a bug patch.<br />Overall, it’s one of my favorite games, which is why I’m so frustrated when the game randomly locks up hard.

Even though we could have gotten the Portal Owners game, we were thrilled to buy the one that came WITH a portal because the Skylanders Giants portals PLUG IN to the game console, instead of using batteries (yes, even rechargeables will drive you mad replacing them constantly).  Just a side note:  In the original Skylanders game, the XBox version had a plug-in portal, but the others all used 3 AA batteries.  So we would really suggest getting this one instead: [[ASIN:B0088MVPRY Skylanders Giants Starter Kit]]<br /><br />My 8 year old son pointed out that I'd never have to change batteries in the new one, as well as saying we could use our battery one as a backup if the new one broke.  (proud mommy)<br /><br />The Skylanders Giants game:  you can use all of the characters from the original game.  Of course there are many different types of new characters that your children are convinced they need:  ones that light up, the Giants ones, Series 2 ones (which is the same one as in the first game, but modified slightly to make the child want the new one, too!)  And there are new regular-sized ones for the Giants game as well.<br /><br />It's so fun, even for adults, and there are a zillion layers in it.  So many different ways to enjoy the game, mini-games, etc.  I'm astounded and delighted that there are games like this out for my son and his friends.<br /><br />It reminded me of when I was young, and got the Final Fantasy game for the first time.  And you realized then that there was so much more to do than the basic video games ever prepared you for.<br /><br />Just my two-cents.  It's very fun, the levels, characters, mini-games, even the art in the game, it's all amazing.  Besides buying the various characters, you can also buy add on worlds.  I've been distressed that my son's 7 and 8 year old friends are playing Call of Duty type games.  I'm so glad that there are wholesome games like Skylanders around so my son can enjoy being a kid and killing little bouncy froggies for now, finding gems, doing puzzles, playing a very addictive stone card game, earning money, buying upgrades (that you get to choose from, not just live with, doing battles and hero quests, and so much more that you may get so lost in the game that may or may not stay up late a couple nights \"checking the game out.\"  ;-)<br /><br />Last year we went all out in what we jokingly referred to as the Ultimate Skylanders mini-game, that's when the parents run from store to store, or online site to online site, in order to track down the various just-released or hard-to-find Skylanders, especially when Activision was caught off guard by the HUGE interest that didn't match up the with the inventory.<br /><br />We set a budget on it this year, though.  And whatever we get, we get.  But the game itself is so much fun, and has so much to offer, that we would highly recommend it.  Hope this helps someone.",

            "question": "title: The story with PS5\ntext: I was really curious to know if this would work on PS5, but couldn't find any information about that, here or anywhere else. So I decided to buy it, try it, and report back.<br /><br />If you're interested in game audio, but turned off by Xtreme Gam3r features like RGB lights, ultra mega bass, and the promise to ruin your EQ to emphasize footsteps, the world of gaming DAC/amps rapidly shrinks. Hey, guy: not everyone is focused on competitive shooters. Some of us are over here playing Death Stranding, feeling the feels when the desolate landscape opens up at the same time as the lonely soundtrack. I was left looking at this GSX 300, and the Fulla E. The Fulla is beloved when it works, but costs more and the company has a bad rep in quality assurance. It made sense to start with the GSX 300, risking the Fulla E if this doesn't work out.<br /><br />It does work! Despite the Q&A section here being full of assertions from EPOS that it absolutely needs a Windows 10 PC and their special software to operate, right out of the box it is detected by the PS5 as a headphone output and a mic input. Up and running in seconds. It does seem to need the console's front USB port to power it, as the others did nothing.<br /><br />Sound quality is subjective, but I challenge you to compare this with the congested sound coming directly out of a controller and not be impressed. I've seen tests showing the GSX 300 delivers a genuinely flat EQ, so any tonality is really down to your headphones. I'm driving a pair of EPOS Sennheiser Game Zeros, the latest version, which I think are 50 Ohms, and getting a nice balanced sound, with a taut, clean bass that reaches low, and some bite in the mids and highs when you turn up. These phones are great at making sounds in the game world feel solid.<br /><br />The biggest surprise after plugging in the GSX 300 was that Sidetone mic monitoring was also working right away. If you have access to a PC, then Hallelujah: against all odds, changes you make to the Sidetone level using the EPOS Gaming Suite software are retained when you reconnect to the PlayStation. By default it's at around 30%, which is subtle but enough to avoid that screaming into the void feeling on closed-back headphones. I like it around 50%.<br /><br />That's about it for advanced features. The button on the front does not function when connected to a PS5. So no switching through custom EQ profiles or enabling simulated 7.1 surround. This is as I'd suspected, and suits me fine as I was really just shopping for a flat EQ and 2.0 stereo.<br /><br />That volume knob on the front is not a real mechanical volume pot, with a beginning and an end; it's a digital parameter wheel that spins and spins. As such, the GSX 300 forgets where you've set the volume each time you switch off the power, which is not super convenient. Luckily, it defaults to a sensible, usable level each time you switch on, probably 50%. My last gaming DAC/amp, a tiny thing from HyperX, would default to 0% volume every time, which became irritating. The GSX default volume might not be thrilling, but it's enough for casual day to day gameplay, and I can clearly hear my friends and the game's audio. If you want more, reach for the dial.<br /><br />While we're on volume: everyone seems to have their own requirements, but to me, with these ears and these headphones, with both the PlayStation output and the GSX cranked all the way up, it's just on the edge of being uncomfortable. Gunshots have a hard movie-theater bark, and bass develops that strong sensation of pressure. I wouldn't play like this for long. However, it won't go to crazy levels. If you like to feel like you've always got more in the tank, this may not be for you. Curiously, on both PC and Mac (yes, it works on my MacBook, too; the knob natively controls the system audio level) it's about twice as loud. I don't know why console audio is attenuated by half, but it seems we can't blame EPOS Sennheiser, as it's the same deal with my old HyperX DAC/amp. This is after the latest firmware update, which promises increased max volume.<br /><br />One last caveat. The blue LED around the volume control is large and bright. It seems predictable that a device like this will end up near your screen, whether that's your desktop monitor or a TV, and therefor in your field of vision. Making it as big and distracting as it is feels like an oversight. I hoped to find a control in the EPOS Gaming Suite software to lower or disable this light, as AV amps tend to allow, but no luck. I find myself facing the device away, which is a shame, as it's an otherwise lovely, simple piece of design, so much visually quieter than the usual gaudy gamer hardware. The white version compliments the PS5 nicely.",

I also wish that it had a software suite to control the DPI of the mouse sensitivity, rather than the physical buttons.

We bought games in a variety of genres so we could get a real feel for the system & figure out what we really enjoy. After trying a couple of other shooting games with the Wii pistol attachment for the Wii Remotes, \"Dead Space Extraction\" is the winner! This game is by far the best of all the games we've tried, including those that are not in the shooting categories.<br /><br />The graphics are amazing, the story line was quick-paced, made sense and the story actually had us wanting to know more. We loved being able to play side by side on a single screen without having to do the whole split screen effect - each of us has our own cross-hairs to aim and shoot the aliens with, but on one screen so we can make full use of the 50\" television. The other nice thing about this game was that the main characters change without losing the flow of the story and the point of the game - keeps things interesting and stirs up the skill set. There are multiple difficulty levels here as well so when you think you've mastered it, you can come back and let it kick your butt all over again. SO GLAD WE BOUGHT THIS ONE!",

Those games are \"Ocarina of Time in HD\" and \"Twilight Princess HD\"<br /><br />Both games do NOT allow wii remote + controller to play them. You HAVE to choose either the Wii U Gamepad or the Wii U Pro Controller.<br /><br />Thankfully this Procube controller tricks the Wii U console into thinking this is a Wii U Pro Controller. So now I can play Wii U Pro Controller supported games with this.<br /><br />Now, I'll admit it does NOT feel as good in the hands as an original Gamecube controller. The buttons are a bit stiffer, clickier sounding. The handles are fatter than the original. And one of the most noticeable differences is the trigger/bumper button shapes.<br /><br />But despite all of that, the layout is very nice and is perfect for playing Gamecube Games, and even N64 games.

            "question": "title: Wonderful Dungeon Crawl with a Strong RPG Feel.\ntext: As a fan of the classic CRPG's Baldur's Gate II, Fallout and Planescape: Torment, I had high hopes for the Neverwinter Nights series.  I was hoping for parties of characters that shared colorful banter.  This game isn't that, but that's not necessarily a bad thing!  Even though this game is rather old, it still holds up, in my opinion!  Yeah, the graphics are a bit dated, but they still look nice. The game play is a mix between Baldur's Gate style games, and Diablo.  It's a top-down dungeon crawl with a bit more menu to work with.  Combat will be a bit slower than Diablo, and you pay more attention to detail in this game than you would in say Baldur's Gate (you only have one character to deal with, not 6.)  I've only played through the main campaigns, and here's my summary of them:<br /><br />NWN:  The game is fine enough, as the story line is only fairly interesting.  The game-play is where this one shines, though!  I found the combat in this game to be very fun.  I played through most of the game as a rogue, then all the way through as a paladin.  You only get one side character at a time, and each one has a little bit of story.  Basically, take one with you and do some adventuring.  As time goes on, they'll fill you in on their past and ask you to do a favor for them.  Once it's complete, they will reward you with a magical item that'll prove fairly useful.  As the game progresses, these trinkets can be upgraded.  My personal favorite character was the halfling rogue.  His story was the most interesting, and his skills can be very useful.  The cleric wastes all her magic on destroying undead, so I found playing through the as a paladin and taking the rogue with me whenever possible was the best for me.  This portion of the game gets a solid 4 stars from me.<br /><br />SoU:  This expansion basically serves as an interlude to get you form the previous to the next.  The story was only OK, and there wasn't much new added to the game-play (though you lose karma in this title if you use the rogue to pick locks!)  If I recall correctly, you get some ability to control your NPC's inventory, which is nice.  I mostly took the dwarf rogue with me through this portion.  None of the NPC's really had my interest for long.  She took care of traps for me, and that was enough.  This part only got 3 stars in my book...<br /><br />HoU:  This expansion was AMAZING for me.  Going through the Underdark is a lot of fun, and you get a wopping 2 NPC's at a time.  YES!  THERE IS BANTER!  The kobold bard from the previous title (was pretty annoying then) follows you through out.  He's pretty much comic relief.  I really enjoyed the story and the characters here.  I think there might have been a slight graphical upgrade too.  Also, there is a way to customize your gear, so you can make your awesome magical gear even more awesome!  5 stars!  It's pretty awesome!<br /><br />One day I'll get to King Maker and some of the other modules.  If so, I'll be sure to edit this post with my input!",

After ogling at the prettiness of the box it came in, I buckled down and started aligning pieces. The instruction videos made it look so easy, I swear!

All I remembered was a lot of frustration, a lot of pressing slippery pieces into place and a lot of application fluid. Proly just a noob thing, but eventually I got the hang of it, how much fluid to spray on and all then, and the rest of the installation went smoothly. Not a perfect job on my end, but GOOD ENOUGH.<br /><br />Proly took a few hours to do all this.<br /><br />I still have a few pieces left as I only needed the exterior of my 3DS covered.

            "question": "title: A great game to rent\ntext: Overall the game is fun, realistic, and engaging.  I really appreciated not having to learn a new button sequence as they kept everything the same as COD.  Therefore, there's really no adjustment period to get used to the controls.  The first thing I usually do when I rent a game is play through the campaign on Normal.  I enjoy playing on Hard difficulty, too, but usually save that for games I purchase.  I was done with the Normal campaign in about 6 hours.  It was certainly the shortest game I have played, and I found myself wishing it was longer.<br /><br />However, similar to COD, they do a nice job mixing things up so that you have a chance to use many different guns and vehicles throughout the game.  Combat is great - the first time I shotgunned a guy in the head...HOLY cow.  Anyway, I think it's definitely one to put on your \"rent list\" and then see what you think.  Luckily, I didn't purchase this game right away since COD was coming out in early Nov.  I would have seriously wanted my $60 back.",

It has simple functionality with only a volume knob, on/off button, and port for USB charging. It is quite comfortable with the normal cushions on the ear pieces and an additional padding on the top part for your head. The microphone works perfectly. The speakers are also great - they insulate the sound so that it doesn't bleed; meaning that people around you can't hear anything.<br /><br />I tested it out on a Mac, PC, and PS4. For the Mac, I needed to go into my System Preferences/ Sound and change my output and input to the headset. Once I did that, they worked with no issue. I tested it with a video chat and the quality was great - both the audio and my microphone. With the PC, I didn't need to do anything to set it up; the PC automatically sensed the headset and started working right away. On the PS4, it also paired fairly quickly. I only need to change the settings to toggle between Chats Only and all sound.<br /><br />The headset connects to your devices with a USB hub; so it is wireless, but not bluetooth enabled. So, it is great for computers or gaming, but you can't use with your iPad or phone. It would have been nice to also have a blue tooth feature so that you could use the same headset across all technology platforms.<br /><br />Bottom line - awesome headset, great quality!",

            "question": "title: Players voted it Best Game of 2019 for a reason...\ntext: Just like the title says: this game was voted by gamers as Best Game of the Year.<br />Not the critics, the PLAYERS voted for it so, yeah, it wasn't an award they bought.<br />From what I understand, this is the first Fire Emblem title to hit it big anywhere outside of Japan and, having played it, I'm glad the devs got some recognition.<br />At first glance (or first couple hours of play time) the game seems straightforward enough. It's a turn based RPG. Pretty much 'nough said in most cases. You either like them or you don't.<br />But.<br />When you're \"released\" from the normal and necessary exposition and tutorial that always comes with starting an RPG, and you can wander around you meet all the usual characters. Of course you do. It's an RPG.<br />Yeah, this time the premise seems interesting and the \"downtime\" activities might be a little unusual-- voice acting is certainly a solid notch above what you usually get in an RPG but it's still an RPG though. I mean, you even have the standard archtypes (if quite a few more than usual): the jock, the socially awkward girl, medieval cheerleaders, geek with the glasses in the back.... They're all there.<br />At least, that's how it STARTS...<br />As you start playing though, between managing inventory, leveling, combat, and, of course, unraveling the main plot etc, etc, etc-- something starts to happen.<br />The One Dimensional archtypes that you've written off actually start taking on... well, DEPTH.<br />And the STORY actually starts getting interesting too!!!!<br />I won't front, it had been SO LONG since I had seen this level of good writing that I had honestly forgotten that it was even possible in an RPG. And the acting is just... WOW.<br />Ok. Yeah. Graphics won't make you weep at the beauty and magesty of realistic 4k as you count the individual hairs on the back of your character's head but... that story and that acting more than make up for it.<br />First off you canNOT hope to get through everything on just one playthrough. Forget multiple ENDINGS, this game has MULTIPLE PLOTS. No joke. The WHOLE STORY is different depending on what you pick in the first few hours.<br />Now, you want multiple endings? OMFG!!!<br />Apparently, after spending do NOT tell me how many hours with these characters, the game actually generates a little ending for each and every single character you have gotten to know based on what YOU were doing during your playthrough.<br />Computer-wise, it probably didn't take that long but the writing chops to go through and figure out what would happen to every single possible pairing of 40 characters and never miss a single beat...<br />Wow. Just. Wow. You have REALLY got to have a definitive idea of who these characters are in your head and remain true to that idea in order to do that- I mean, Hollywood has a hard time doing that with less than FIVE over 90 minutes a lotta times. So, yeah, hat's off there. Lol.<br />So, the writing and the acting rocks but, this is a GAME, how's that gameplay, you're asking...<br />I haven't had this much fun with a turned based in a long, long time.<br />The loads of menus IS a little intimidating at first but it's honestly not that difficult to get the hang of things. Tiny touches and flourishes make things both a little easier to pick up and a little rewarding as you do. I love the real time prediction mechanic that shows you how much damage a character can make to an enemy and how much damage they can do back so you can experiment a bit BEFORE you confirm a command. Another nice touch is the little action cutscenes when an attack is made. You CAN turn them off if you want but I left them on because they actually seemed to add a little more drama to the fights.<br />Now, I will admit that this game is a Completionist's NIGHTMARE. Because of all of the different characters and all of the different details and all of the different plots. I tried to do my normal grinding for levels, etc but eventually learned that that's NOT how you're supposed to play this game. You're supposed to just play the game and pretty much let the cards fall where they may when it comes to the details. And that is how I recommend playing it.<br />Also, folks who gots ta has their eye-candy and/or looove that space bar when it comes to playing on the computer (skip cut scenes alot) will NOT find any fun here. Nor is this a good game for action junkies. Y'all got Devil May Cry, etc for that. Go enjoy Astral Chain. Great game too and far more enjoyable for button mashing.<br />You want to wander through a great story with interesting characters and excellent acting though?<br />Yeah. Stop debating, just hit that buy button and-- well, cancel any future plans you got for the next few months. U gon b buzy.<br />:D",

The case holds the device snugly, and is very well padded.<br /><br />The zipper is stable, closes easily, and doesn't jam or open on its own.  I think that's important for a case like this.<br /><br />I highly reccomend keeping the little baggie the clasp comes in.  It's perfect for storing the super-tiny Sony storage cards.  Then you can stuff that in the webbed area and have them together with your system and not easily lost in the case.  I find no use for the clasp, but as clasps go, it's a nice, sturdy one.<br /><br />It's large enough for the AR cards to sit in the top compartment, though a slot for them might have been nice. They don't fit in the webbed area--not quite.<br /><br />It's a good, basic case.",

We both really like that there is a sound control and on/off switch in the cord that is easily accessible too. The microphone rotates up when not in use which was a sticking point for her. I should note that they do light up, something we didn’t expect is that there are two cords to plug in. One is the headphone jack and the other is a USB plug that powers the lights. That’s all it does. So if you don’t want them to light up, they don’t have to. However, when they do light up they rotate in a rainbow of colors. They don’t stay a solid color that you can choose. This was not that important to either of us but was a fun feature nonetheless. Overall, we both recommend these headphones. The quality of the product is sturdy and doesn’t feel like it will break any time soon. Great purchase!",

            "question": "title: First Impressions: It's the BioWare MMO\ntext: My main first impression, a little more than ten hours in and around level 13, is that this is \"the BioWare MMO\".<br /><br />What I mean by that is that if you are used to playing BioWare's games (particularly the more recent titles like Dragon Age or Mass Effect, but even also the older KOTOR series), you'll find that this game plays mostly like a BioWare game with MMO elements -- it's basically a BioWare storyline game stiched together with MMO elements.  Whether you like this or not will depend on the degree to which you like the BioWare approach to game design, with its strong emphasis on storytelling, cinematic cut-scenes with interactive dialogue, choice-driven character development, and the like.<br /><br />I have always liked BioWare's games, and so these elements are welcome in an MMO experience for me.  Gameplay is also what you would expect in a BioWare game (in my opinion):  good, but fairly \"standard\".  In my opinion, BioWare does not design its games around gameplay, but around storyline and setting, and gameplay is intended to be engaging, but essentially to forward the story line in an interactive way.  TOR is no different from this general approach.  The gameplay, in terms of nuts and bolts, is very similar to what you have in other \"theme park\" style MMORPGs -- quest hubs, leveling advancement, training/banking/trading hubs, leveled zones and the like.  It is all done competently in TOR, with remarkably few glitches, but the gameplay isn't revolutionary, new, groundbreaking or anything like that -- it's standard, good, gameplay for the genre which is used to advance you along the storyline with its many interactive cinematic scenes.<br /><br />What does this mean for potential players?  One point is that if you are a veteran MMO fan, looking for something that is new and groundbreaking in terms of the actual gameplay elements, this isn't going to be it.  What is new and groundbreaking about TOR is the interweave of the BioWare elements of storyline and interactive cinematics and dynamic character development, rather than actual gameplay mechanics.  I think that quite a few of the people who are liking the game less fall into this category of people who are MMO vets and \"want something new\" from the perspective of gameplay mechanics, and find that TOR is a competent iteration of familiar gameplay mechanics for a theme park MMO, but with a lot of the elements from BioWare's single player game design ideas woven in.<br /><br />It also means that if you are a big fan of BioWare's single player games, you'll probably like this MMO more than most, due to its emphasis on many of the same elements that BioWare has introduced and emphasized in its single player titles.  Having said that, because it is an MMORPG which has to have a lot of other elements involved, the storyline and cinematics and so on are not at the same level -- in my opinion -- as what we have grown used to in, say, the Mass Effect series.  In other words, it isn't a single player game.  It's an MMORPG \"chassis\" stitched together with BioWare's game design ideas from its single player games, but done in such a way that they \"fit\" in the context of an MMORPG.<br /><br />Where this game goes remains to be seen.  It's solid, not very buggy or glitchy, and has a huge pre-existing fanbase both for the setting/IP and for the developer, and is fairly easy to pick up and play.  That confluence of factors hasn't aligned this way in the MMORPG world since .... WoW.  We've had games made for great IPs that didn't turn out to be great games (STO, AoC, WAR), and we've had games made by respected developers that didn't turn out very well, too, but this kind of confluence hasn't happened in a while.  We will have to see where it goes as the game develops over the course of the next several months.",

Take it apart and instead of standard Philips screws this little bastard has the tiniest torx I've ever seen. Smaller than any torx bit I own. There is no reason for this beyond a middle finger aimed at customers trying to fix their own gear.  End edit:<br /><br />Downsides, in order of severity.<br />It doesn't always work. It can go a week without issue or I could loose signal to the mouse half a dozen times in a day. When this happens the only solution is to unplug and re-plug the mouse. This has occurred on both my desktop and laptop, so is an issue with the product, not my hardware.<br /><br />Battery life is less than 1/4 of what's advertised. This is honestly fine, but I strongly recommend getting a few sets of rechargeable batteries  and having them ready.<br /><br />Every time you plug it into a computer it automatically installs it's garbage bloatware software without prompting.

I figured the FLYDIGI app is what I needed, and sure enough I found it on the Playstore.  The app uses lingo and terms only gamers probably understand. Classic mode, native mode, mapping mode, Flashplay mode, etc. There is a big learning curve to understand what all these modes mean and does. Next to word CONNECTED, is the word UNACTIVATED. Apparently you need to activate something, and it gives you a choice of using U-Tool or the PC. What is U-Tool? I don't know, but the app assumes you do know. So I googled \"U-TOOL flydigi\" and I discover it's some sort of rooting dongle. So then I figure, I'll check out the PC method. For this option, they tell you to go to their website and download the PC tool. Except, the only option is an Android APK. SMH.<br /><br />They have an email, and they seem to have a community, but I'm not that much into gaming to put in this type of effort. I wanted a controller that would hold my phone, so I can play roblox with my kids, that's it. LOL! Because I hate the touch controls in Roblox. This is too complicated. I'll go 3-Stars!

            "question": "title: Bugs and Design Flaws\ntext: EDIT (April 1) -- Well, the game has been out almost a month now, and while the servers are mostly stable now (rollbacks are still not uncommon, but connectivity is mostly stable), nevertheless the game is riddled with questionable design choices and outright bugs currently.  One might hope that the bugs will be addressed at some point in the not too distant future, but it appears unlikely that the design choices will be revisited.  These impact things like city size, traffic functionality, the interplay of demand between R, C and I, the trade system, and the overall problem that the simulation is, frankly, too easy and too streamlined to provide the kind to depth that SimCity's fanbase would have liked to have seen in the game.  I would be very careful before deciding to buy this game, as a result.<br /><br />=====<br /><br />It's been a long time since the last iteration of the series was released -- January 2003, in fact, just over ten years ago.  So, you can afford to wait a bit longer to buy the next iteration -- and you should.<br /><br />SimCity has been reimagined as a multiplayer online game.  The ostensible game-design reason this was done was to permit people to play in a region together with other people online, each controlling one city in a region, trading resources, specializing their city and cooperating with the other mayors in the region to achieve challenges and build regional great works like large airports.  While that may sound well enough, the side effects of this core design decision are many -- both technical and gameplay.<br /><br />First, the technical -- and this is why you should not buy this game right now, but wait to buy.  Because SC has been recast and redesigned as a multiplayer online game, it is played on servers, as is the case with an MMORPG.  The city you are playing exists on a region on one of EA's servers, and not locally on your machine.  You must be connected to EA's servers and logged into them in order to play, just as if you were playing an MMO.  And, if a server is down or offline or full, you can play on another server, but, just as would be the case in an MMO, your \"character\" (here, your city) is located on the other server which is full -- if you want to play on a different server, you need to create (claim) a new city.  This will all seem familiar to gamers who have played MMORPGs, but may seem surprising to players of the previous iterations in the franchise, because this kind of architecture has never been present in the franchise before, and is not common in city-builder simulator games in general.  And, as is the case with MMORPGs, this kind of design generally leads to a lot of problems when the game is first released due to the heavy volume of player interest.  That is, the servers are set up to accommodate a stabilized player load, and not the rush of new players when the game is released.  So, currently there are massive, massive server problems for this game, making it barely playable -- servers are offline, or being maintained, or simply full, there are queues, there are rampant disconnects from servers in which one's city fails to save to EA's cloud, meaning that significant progress -- perhaps 30 or more minutes of play -- is simply lost into the ether.  At this point, because of the server problems the game is experiencing and the large load of players (the game just released in Europe, meaning more players inundating the already full servers -- and, no, the servers aren't geographically limited in terms of who can login to them), it just isn't very playable.  Your best bet, even if you are intrigued by the new design, is to wait 10 days or so for the initial rush to die down and then check on internet sites to see if the servers are stable yet.<br /><br />Second, the impact of this design on gameplay is substantial and wide-ranging.<br /><br />For starters, the basic idea of the game is now to play in multiplayer regions where the cities depend on each other.  As a part of this design, the size of any one city in a region is rather small and limited -- very limited when compared to SimCity 4, for example.  You aren't supposed to be building the one great city, but a specialized city that works together with other cities -- trading resources and services with each other based on comparative advantages.  In this way SC adds a regional cooperation simulator into the game, but it's more of a cooperative online game than a simulator, as you are really playing trade-offs with other players.  The main impact of this is that it limits what you can do with your own city, because you are kept to a small enough space, and with only certain resources and not others, so as to force you to specialize.  Now, you can play this in private mode, where you control all of the cities in the region, but this is still a very different kind of gameplay than previous versions of SimCity featured.<br /><br />Another set of impacts from this is that, unless you are playing in something called \"sandbox mode\", you lose a lot of control over what you can do in your cities.  The reason, again, is that this is designed as a multiplayer game, and like many multiplayer games it therefore polices what you can do, as a player, when you are playing.  Even if you are playing in \"private\" mode, you are still restricted, because in theory your gameplay could result in leaderboard rankings, achievements, challenge rankings and so on.  If you are playing in sandbox mode, these aspects fall away -- that is, your play is not \"counted\" towards any of these -- and you get more flexibility to control what is happening in your game.  But, keep in mind that even though this sounds like \"single player mode\", it is still taking place on EA's servers and streaming to your computer, and therefore you need a continuous connection to the internet to play in sandbox mode as well.<br /><br />The game has some interesting features as well, like upgrading public buildings, more variety in road design, and, of course, much better graphics.  But prospective buyers should (1) wait at least until the server rush dies down and the servers are stabilized so that you can actually play the game for more than 20 minutes at a time and (2) consider carefully whether you want the kind of design that the game is -- a design that is focused on the regional level of play to a much greater degree than earlier games, and which is fundamentally designed to be played on a regional level with other players rather than as a single player game.<br /><br />----<br /><br />Note that this is an initial review -- I will edit this review as time passes and I can experience the game without the current server issues and become a bit more attuned to the new design.",

            "question": "title: 2 for 2, failed buttons. Just get a Deathadder\ntext: I wanted to like this mouse. I like the position of the buttons (particularly the toggle DPI that lets you have a \"snipe\" button - more mice need that) and the general shape of the mouse, but it's just got so many problems, including abysmal build quality (which is shocking for logitech)<br /><br />For starters, it's weirdly draggy and a bit heavy, even wired and with zero weights in it. I can't see anyone wanting to add more of the included weights - the point of this kind of mouse is to start LIGHT and let you tune it, not start heavy and let you make it worse. Genuinely heavier than my full size WIRELESS teknet mouse that I use for my media PC.<br /><br />The feet lasted okay, they're starting to feel worn after a year of use on an aluminum banshee pad mousepad (I usually got about 2-3 years out of a set of feet on a Razer Deathadder) And they're very sensitive to picking up schmutz. Replacement feet are not readily found, you're gonna be using teflon tape. The combination of really meh feet and really heavy/draggy weight makes the mouse wildly imprecise after only a couple months. Even with teflon tape over the feet, I still can't make a \"clean\" drag across my mousepad with a smooth cursor movement. Not even sure it would when it was new. The  aforementioned teknet mouse still absolutely glides after years. I think it's just because the 502 has SIX absolutely gigantic pads, and other mice I use tend to have 3 or 4 much smaller feet at most, which keeps the inherent friction lower.<br /><br />Cord is okay if used with a mouse bungie.<br /><br />The scroll wheel is abysmal. It has a side/side rock, which is already not good for a proper gaming mouse (they all have a habit of mis-registering mouse 3 clicks) but this is easily the worst I've ever experienced. I am used to the design, but this one is so bad and vague that I had to straight up disable the rocker, so now I only get about 15% of my middle clicks mis-sensed. The ability to unlock a scroll wheel is nice when I have to turbo scroll through a 300 page document, but again, in GAMING practice, is just one more way the scroll wheel feels incredibly vague and inaccurate.<br /><br />mouse 4 is just set too far back. You have to press it with the knuckle of your thumb, which requires an incredibly awkward \"palm pinch\". If you use all the mouse buttons in a game, you're going to hate this thing so much.<br /><br />And the thing is INCREDIBLY fragile. My first one's left click broke just sliding off my chair onto carpet, the whole mouse button itself sheared off. The second one's L2 switch itself is now failing, as it registers right click but doesn't register HOLDING it. After only a year, this is appalling. If you play MMO's, this makes steering an absolute nightmare. If you play FPS games, right click iron sight/scope becomes agony.<br /><br />And there's something about this mouse that gives me really sweaty palms, which is weird because I have a kind of hybrid palm/fingertip grip that keeps my palm usually hovering just above the mouse<br /><br />My deathadder was only replaced by this mouse because I suspected the skin flakes embedded in the chassis had evolved a new form of life. This one is getting hucked in the garbage because it fell to pieces in a little over a year and a half. I am staying away from Logitech for a few years after two absolutely atrocious peripherals and going back to the good old iron duke of a Razer Deathadder.",

I used to be a die hard unmentioned brand fan boy at one time, but I have found that there are many others that have risen to compete against the best. HyperX happens to be one of those. I have a few other products from them that have blown me away in performance and quality. This Pulsefire Raid is most definitely my favorite at the moment. These days I mostly use a good mouse for video and photography editing and though I don't game much anymore, I would rather use a gaming mouse over a standard boring mouse. The Pulsefire Raid is anything but boring. It feels good in the hand and with the responsive clicky buttons, it makes for a better editing experience. I love that I can still take advantage of the programmable buttons as shortcuts within my editing software. It has become my new obsession to find the most useful and time saving shortcuts to map to my mouse. The Pulsefire Raid makes this so easy and I couldn't be happier with the overall performance. The customize-able lighting is fun to play with and that lighted logo is just so sick looking. Plus I love how smoothly it glides across my mouse pad.

These are the worst that I have purchased so far. After around 3 charges each the batteries don’t hold a charge anymore.  Also, the batteries would show that they were “green” and charged. I put them in my Xbox controller and it would show 3/4 fully charge then after about 10 minutes of playing a game, the controller would disconnect. I also NEVER got a warning when the batteries were getting low. I would be in the middle of a gaming session and the controller would just disconnect and it would be because the battery was dead. Another thing I don’t like is the charging unit which charges the batteries is poorly made. My brand new Xbox One controller would show the battery as dead. Would not even connect to my Xbox. I put it in the unit to charge and it would show “green” as if the battery was fully charged. Then after being in the charging unit for about 5 minutes the light would turn red and then the charging sequence would start and it would go from green to red to orange to green. It never showed as red when I put the dead battery in the charging unit. I purchased other rechargeable batteries that are wonderful and are still working perfectly.

I play about three to four hours a day since I got it now for about fourteen days.  I'm not as good as some I see on you tube beating stuff on level one they do and I'm level seven and still calling it a fight.  Besides me being lame, the nice part is you can level up quick by making weapons like daggers non stop in white run, or by making potions again white run, or by even if your level one or so just take a rubber band around your xbox controller and make your character sneak for an hour against a door or wall where there's people around, you will go up in sneak quick and probably a few levels for character and no work other than watching for the the system to make you reconnect or return on you controller which will shut off in about every twenty minutes or so.  I just bought a house and am about level fifteen or eighteen not sure now, cash will come later and a lot of time is spent with potions, smithing, and using soul gems to make weapons to then sell them for good cash instead of peasly amounts for unmagical stuff.  I get two hundred to five hundred an item now, turn undead weapons pay the best I've noticed, even with just a few charges in them.  It's a game that will draw you in to wanting to just get one more thing done or get ready for the next day as is the way I play.  Killed my first dragon today and two ogres (ogres from distance with arrow one hit from them or two would kill me) was a rush.  I highly recommend this game though I don't appreciate how now I can smith dwarven and elvish armor and it's barely any better than just leather or studded, kind of ticked me spending perks since you only get one perk point a level to spend.  Oh well keeps playing turf even I guess instead of becoming to bad ass, lol.  Get this game if you like role playing getting used to fighting is a slight challenge to keep facing the foe or being the right distance to hit him with weapons.  I use fire on my left hand and a sword in my right seems to work for me the best.  Good luck and enjoy the journey.",

I don't use the 3D effect too much but the features are still really beautiful. I like that you can chose 12 lives. I recommend to become efficient in every life class. I started off with the Paladin and use him as my main character with whom I do the Bliss Quests which is the main story line. To learn how to mine and fell trees and to fish is very useful while you explore the different areas. Other trades such as Blacksmith, Carpenter or Alchemist and Cook are also useful to learn. I like making my own furniture or cloths as example. Each life has its own set of quests. Even if I finish a quest while I am in a different life the game will let me know. The credit though for completing those quests can only be received once you change into the life to which the quests belongs to. I try to keep an balance between fighting my way through the game and trying to create items I can sell or use for myself or meals I can also sell. In the game you have a general leveling up and also a certain level you can gain through your quests within a that life. Once you finish a certain pain in the main story you also invite other characters in  the game to fight with you and you can play through your internet  with other players once you befriend them and they own this game as well. I know the game can be redundant, you always have to collect items or constantly have to battle monsters, but I also like games like Harvest Moon or Rune Factory or Pokeman. I received 3 DS games this Christmas from my children, I am an older player, and this is my favorite game ever.

            "question": "title: Classic game\ntext: Back in the mid 1990's I worked for a small engineering company, and for a time you could tell when it was 5pm without even looking at your watch. That was because the sound of keyboards being pounded began to echo through the engineering department. Myself and seven other engineers would start playing Descent right at 5 o'clock and continue to do so till late into the night. It was a great game.<br /><br />I never got around to playing the version for the original Playstation until years later when I had bought a Playstation 2 console. Just recently I purchased one of the new Playstation 3 slim consoles, and I was under the impression that the PS3's could not play Playstation 1 or 2 games. But a couple weeks ago I was reading a thread in the Amazon Video Game customer discussion forum and someone there mentioned that you could in fact play PS 1 games in a PS 3. I tried playing the original PS1 Silent Hill game and it worked! Finding that out I went and browsed the used video games here on Amazon looking for some old classics to buy. Descent Maximum was the first one I ordered. Got it in about a week later and have been playing it since.<br /><br />The game play is as I remember it - with the exception you're playing against the game itself and not other people. Being an old PS1 game, playing it on one of today's 42\" television leaves a lot to desire - the graphics are really blocky on a screen that size (still playable though). So I ended up moving my PS3 and connecting it to a smaller 24\" monitor, which suited the low-res video resolution better.<br /><br />Descent Maximum is very similar to the PC Descent II game - you have similar tunnel systems, weapons, and the addition of the guidebot to lead you to objects and locations. Like the PC game, you can rotate your ship 360° in any direction (which at the time made some people a bit queasy). There are six worlds to play, each with six levels (36 total). Blowing up the reactor on the first level when I played this PS1 disc for the first time brought back memories.<br /><br />There are a lot of fun old games like this out there - I'm glad to find out that I can still play them and will be looking for more.",

            "question": "title: Feels cheap, but works well and has lots of features\ntext: I don't usually go for 3rd party controllers, but Brook makes some nice products usually. The packaging is really nice, but when I opened it, right off the bat this controller feels cheap. It may be a little more than half the price of a Pro controller, but it feels more like a $15 offering.<br /><br />It seems that Brook products never come with instructions even though they really need them. The advanced functions of this controller, like turbo and macros, are not intuitive to setup. You can get the instructions on their website, but a printed version would really be nice.<br /><br />The first thing I did was sync the controller to my Switch over USB. I was extremely confused because the face buttons were all mapped incorrectly. The X and Y buttons were reversed and the A and B buttons were reversed, so attack and jump were on the right side of the diamond layout instead of the left that we're all used to.<br /><br />The next time I booted up the Switch and the controller was already synced to Bluetooth, the buttons were all correctly mapped. I thought maybe it was just a weird fluke. So, I hooked it back up to USB and the buttons were reversed again. So, I don't know what's up with that, but playing wirelessly works great and playing over USB messes up the button mapping.<br /><br />The analog sticks feel pretty good. I don't have any issues with those. The AL and AR buttons on the bottom are actually pretty cool. They are basically shift keys to hold down and reduce the speed of the analog sticks to make aiming easier. This actually works really well.<br /><br />The turbo functions work, but require instructions to understand how to set it up.<br /><br />The d-pad feels ok. It's certainly better than something like an Xbox 360 controller d-pad, but nowhere near as nice as the Switch Pro controller. It's responsive and not too difficult to slide your thumb around on it. Each direction is distinct and easy to find with your thumb.<br /><br />The buttons are all responsive and actually feel pretty good, regardless of how cheap the plastic shell is for the controller.<br /><br />The battery does seem to last a reasonable amount of time and the Bluetooth works well without dropouts.<br /><br />I tried the controller with my iPhone. The phone fits nicely in the cradle that connects to the controller. I didn't really have any games to use it on, but it worked well navigating the Game Center menus.<br /><br />TLDR;<br /><br />Overall, this feels cheap, but is very functional. I wouldn't pay $40 for it when you can get a Pro controller for a little more. Unless you want the turbo, macro, or analog sensitivity modifiers, then you could probably get away with a cheaper controller that works as well.<br /><br />Pros<br />  - Responsive buttons and analog sticks<br />  - Battery life and Bluetooth connectivity are good<br />  - Lots of features (turbo, macro, and analog sensitivity modifiers)<br />  - Comes with charging cable and mobile phone cradle<br /><br />Cons<br />  - Feels cheaper than the price suggests<br />  - Weird button mapping when using USB<br />  - No instructions included<br /><br />Edit:<br />I'll add that the thumbsticks are actually quite slippery. The actual Pro controller isn't perfect either, but this one is definitely more slippery than the Pro.",

I preordered the shaft from the manufacturers website and just received it a couple of days ago. I have to say that it works awesome. It runs all the old VC games and works great with the N64 games as well. It is awesome playing Brawl with this thing too and I'm excited to use it with the new Mario Kart game.<br /><br />The joystick fits perfectly in my hand and I like the feel of it. The buttons are the right size and the stick feels great as well. At first I thought it would have been nice if it were wireless but to be honest I think I like it better this way. It always seems that my wiimote batteries are dead and the response time with the classic controller has noticable lag. The joystick looks really good too. There is another joystick out there, the Hori, but it is an ugly box and it won't control analog games (N64 games, wii games, gamecube games).<br /><br />I like some games with the wiimote but I still feel most games should use a controller. I hated playing Brawl with the wiimote and if this controller only worked with that game it would have been worth it. Great product from a new company.

            "question": "title: Not perfect, but it works, nothing was broken :-)\ntext: From purchase to setup, I am pretty pleased. However the hiccups were there.<br /><br />While others chose All Access, which is actually separate from this bundle offer, considered a \"new model.\" I chose the Black Friday limited time offer, then paying in equal installments over 12 months, using Amazon Prime Visa. I did this, because I converted from Live Gold to Ultimate Access, recently, and have two years prepaid. Over two years, though, the Xbox One X bundle is actually cheaper, when considering Ultimate is two thirds of the cost. On top of that, All Access requires a Capitol One credit check, and I didn't want that in my wallet.<br /><br />The order was shipped across the country, why? I don't know, I would have thought the local Amazon warehouse would have had it ready for same day delivery. When it arrived, it was raining, though no attempt was made to deliver it to the door. It was dropped 6ft over the fence. Strange, you tell them once, deliver over the fence for a soft package you weren't going to be home for, then for the rest of your life everything gets tossed over the fence, no matter what it is. Fortunately only the outer box got soaked. The rest remained dry.<br /><br />Somethings I noticed. The Xbox One X was made mid 2019, yet Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is a new game bundle. There was a secondary set of circular stickers sealing the sleeve to the packaging. Also the primary box was dusty. I have a theory. Somewhere along the chain, the box was opened, and the contents replaced/changed/updated, then the bundle sleeve was added. I don't know who does this, Microsoft or Amazon.<br /><br />I was disappointed that the game was a digital download, and not a disc. The item presentation suggests a disc. Still, I cannot play the game. After downloading over night, it has 11 hours left. Not everyone has gigabit.<br /><br />Setting up the unit wasn't as easy as documentation suggested. The iPhone Xbox App does not use the camera, therefore you cannot use the QR code to set things up. Also because the unit was so old, there was a 700MB+ update required and this disrupted and complicated the setup. Where I could type in a code to setup the unit from my phone, it forgot after the update, and I had to do it again on reboot - the iPhone app was no longer able to participate. Also, I had to manually enter codes to add the game license and extend Xbox Live Gold, by 20 days. What ever happened to using the camera and OCR to read the codes? Oh that feature is with the QR code reader - non-existent.<br /><br />I replaced my Blu-Ray player with the bundle, on a new 4K TV. I decided to reuse the HDMI High Speed 1.4 cable, already run to the previous component. This may have been the source of screen blackouts during setup. I have reseated the cable and it hasn't blackout since. But the situation has been noted.<br /><br />I liked that the Xbox detected the TV was 4K and a switched over to the higher setting.",

Townspeople say generic things and most of the settings look like animatronic rides that cycle animations...all the people look wooden.<br /><br />The story is kind of OK.  I am 10 hours in and just don't care about it.  Alphen and Shionne have a ridiculous relationship where they love each other one minute and hate each other the next.  The little interstitial dialogues you activate with R1 (when you notice the tiny message in the bottom right corner) paint Shionne as a weirdo...in these, she's goofy, hungry, absent-minded, etc. but in the main game dialogue, she's an icy cold princess who will destroy anything in her path.  None of the characters are well developed and it's hard to care about them at all.<br /><br />The music is garbage.  It's the usual symphonic mess that all blends together, sounds exactly the same as every other game, and offers no emotional cues other than annoyance.  I turned it down to 10 in the menu, as should you.  The voice acting is OK but the characters repeat the same phrases during battle over and over again in either Japanese or English.  The Japanese-to-English translation is also pretty liberal and I switched over to the English-only option because my ears were hearing things that the subtitles were not saying.<br /><br />The battle system is stupid.  All enemies, even the low-level trash mobs, have a ton of HP and take an excessive amount of time to clear as you don't do much damage unless you get the ultra-precise combo strings every single time. You can also just run in circles to avoid damage but, since you don't do much damage yourself, it takes way too long to take out even weak enemies.  It got to the point where I was trying like hell to avoid battles...but then this game requires you to grind battles to get any kind of levels to face bosses.  You also don't get much money to upgrade your gear.  Bandai Namco wants you to buy upgrades (+5 levels, 100000 gald, etc.) with real cash and the game reflects that in its core design.  It's bullshit that forces you to pay with cash or your own valuable lifespan just to get to the next boring, non-interactive map.<br /><br />The game is pretty lame; it has main characters with nice modeling and various sexy outfits that keep the incels happy but it's shallow, boring, and trite.

I am not sure how this company can stay in business. This is now the third time I realize that I ordered an item from this company and 2 of them they got wrong! I would recommend to purchase cables from a different vendor. They do sell nice cables but odds are you will not get what you wanted.",

We both found this game to be very challenging and addictive.  This is a great game for all ages although it might be a little scary for some youngsters.<br /><br />One thing that we found amusing about this game was a little hidden text.  There is a challenge where you will go downstairs to a room (kind of like a lab) and read some letters and notes.  This is towards the end of the game.  The main part you are supposed to read is darker than the rest of the text.  If you strain and read the lighter text, you will see some interesting things there.  It's been a while since we played it so I don't remember the exact text but it had to do with views towards the current president.

Simply increase the Global_Hype_Scaling in the drivers.ini file for all drivers and presto the opposition AI cars can go any speed you want. Slow them down to where you can outdrive them using your feet if for some strange reason you want to. Or make them go much faster than the game defaults to where nobody could ever beat even one of them unless the blow an engine. Or anything in between.<br /><br />To test just go to qualifying stay in the pits and accelerate time. You will see the speeds of every other driver during qualifying that your new Hype number changes have accomplished. Then by  trial and error take an hour and set the global hype scaling to where a few of the other drivers are slower  than you, but most are faster. Now you can learn to drive without being discouraged!<br /><br />Soon you will decrease the Hype to speed up the opposition as you learn how to drive.<br /><br />This sim is the most configurable racing sim ever.<br />And therefore one of the best to learn with.<br />It is also the best racing sim ever.

            "question": "title: Lightweight, average sound\ntext: I was drawn to the Logitech G435’s because of the design for smaller heads and how lightweight they are. Headphones that are too heavy or tight give me a headache, and many of the headsets designed for male gamers are just too big for me.<br /><br />The G435’s are VERY light, weighing in at 5.8oz. That’s light enough to dangle off my pinky finger. Some comfort is sacrificed to reduce the weight -- the headband has no padding. A tightly woven mesh sleeve covers the top portion of the headphones, I can easily feel the frame. I can see the mesh getting snagged if you put these in a backpack or bag, it’s not super durable. The earcups are also some sort of mesh, which I found comfortable for a few hours, but not a super long gaming session.<br /><br />The earcups do not “lock” or click into position. So every time you put them on or take them off, the earcups slide up and down, and you have to readjust the fit. The earcups are on the smaller side; these headphones are best for kids, teens, or adults with small heads. The description says, “fits a wide range of people but designed for younger players with memory foam ear cushions and sizing for smaller head sizes.” Definitely younger and smaller head sizes, not a wide range of people.<br /><br />Sound quality is on the lower end of average. Not quite tin can, but “hollow” is the best way for me to describe it. Quite frankly, I expect better from Logitech. I don’t use a gaming headset for just gaming -- I use a headset for everything, including listening to music and watching tv/movies. When I was trying the G435’s and listening to music or watching a show, I found myself reaching for my usual headphones because the sound was just not great.<br /><br />The headphones do not have any play controls on the earcups, only power, volume up/down, and a mute button.<br /><br />The headphones have no noise cancelling, and in fact, I thought they magnified background noise. My mom watches videos in the next room and I could still hear her videos over whatever I had playing when using the G435’s. I have other headphones that don’t have noise cancelling but they still block out the background noise. Not so with the G435’s.<br /><br />Battery life is really good. I did get about 15 hours right out of the box. The headphones charge via USB-C. They are only wireless via the Lightspeed adapter or Bluetooth.<br /><br />Overall, these headphones are a mixed bag for me. I like how lightweight they are, but the sound quality is not what I expect from Logitech.",

            "question": "title: I love the concept, but certain things take away from the fun\ntext: I love the idea of this game. Basically you play a character who chooses to quit taking his \"joy\" pill and instead try to remember the past, which is mostly your brother and what happened to him along with the rest of the world. The joy pill basically is a pill that does what it says. It makes you happy and joyful, and forget all your troubles.  While on joy everything around you appears bright and colorful and safe. While off it you see the truth, a foggy and dull world full of rotten food, etc.<br /><br />So the idea is great! I love it. However, my biggest problem with it are the following:<br /><br />Food and water: You have to eat and drink water every so often. Failing to do so results in low stamina which means you can't run for as long,  and it also affects fighting.<br /><br />Sleep: This too affects your stamina if you fail to get enough of it.<br /><br />The above (food, water,  and sleep) offer no fun to the game at all. It's just annoying as hell to deal with. Why they thought this would add value is beyond me. Never once during any other game that I've played in the past did I say to myself &#34;Boy, I wish my character required food, water, and sleep. That'd be so much fun!&#34; -- NOT! It's annoying. The only game that gets away with that are the Sims.<br /><br />Another annoyance: There comes a point in the game where you'll be made to take joy pills to blend in with the town you're in. The problem is Joy pills only lasts 1-2 minutes in real time. It's highly frustrating having to constantly search for a booth (where the pills are located) every 2 minutes when all I really want to do is explore. And no, you cannot fill a bottle with pills. You may be able to find a loose pill that can be carried with you here and there, but overall you'll be relying on booths. If you fail to take your pill on time the crowd will attack you. Even if you hurry and run into a booth to take it, they're still after you! So if you plan to explore, good luck. I struggled so I gave up.<br /><br />Furthermore, there are glitches and bugs with the game still. I feel they released it too early. They should have waited until they were fixed.<br /><br />Overall, still an enjoyable game. Could be better is all.",

I quickly earned my reputation points for the lake and entered my first tournament.  SURPRISE!!!! you don't begin the tournament in the same location as you do for free fishing!!! Well I was totally lost and lost my first tourny.  The next one went much better as I learned what to expect (FYI- DON'T be late getting back-  even a second late means you lose a pound of fish!)  After about 8 to 10 hours play I hve unlocked 6 lakes, won a boat, earned enough gift cards for 2 additional rod/reel combos, purchased a tackle box full of lures, and lost every boat race challange I have tried!  Yea this game takes a bit of getting used to but it does have a lot of play value and I'm having a blast!",

            "question": "title: Disappointed Overall\ntext: My daughter and I ordered the digital downloads directly from Nintendo's eShop, plus two pre-orders from Amazon to give as gifts.  After playing my game for 15 minutes I was wishing I hadn't downloaded it because now I'm stuck with it.  I can't give it away, and I can't trade it in or resell it.  Only option we have is to play, and make the best of it.  But I will be spending the $5.95 to return the two unopened games to Amazon.<br />We have played the two previous ds games and loved them both, the 2nd was better than the first one.  Because of our experience we were very excited to play the new 3ds release.<br />There have been many changes made, some good, but more bad. The graphics are a nice improvement, and being able to play with in-game friends is a welcome addition.  We think it's cute having Nibbles, the vivosaur follow you around.<br />We feel they have made what used to be a fun game very annoying, and more juvinile.  The instructions are a little vague at times.  The Bone Buggies, while nice, are harder to control.  I realize that further in the game there are upgrades that improve this, but it will take some practice, patience, and feelings of frustration at the time wasted trying to maneuver into the position you want to go.  We don't like how you only have one chance at digging up a fossil.  Meaning you can't save before you clean a fossil in case you want to retry again.  But it can be convenient because you don't have to keep going back to clean them when your pockets are full.  It's nice that the jewels you find are automatically sold too.<br />Also, we do not like that they took away the ability to see where you are on the main Park.  The bottom screen shows the map, but now there is no dot on the map making it easy to know where you are, and where you want to go.  I found that convenient, and used it all the time on the other games. It takes getting used to this change, and wish it was still available.<br />One last thing I want to point out is there is no way we think this game should be compared to Pokemon.  It is my opinion it's being compared as a selling tactic because of Pokemon's popularity.  The Pokemon games are a favorite with our friends and family.",

            "question": "title: Worst Lego game, in my opinion. It's fine if you just want to pass the time.\ntext: I love Lego games. I own them all. This is my least favorite for several reasons.<br />There are only about 14 levels. Most of those levels are ridiculously long. If you save halfway through, you are likely to lose some of your mini kits.<br />There are so many things crammed onto the levels that it can get annoying. I hate having to keep going back to change Batman or Robin suits. I hate that I can't just pick a suit in freeplay mode. I can only use a suit when it's there and needed.<br />My game only had a couple glitches, but it just added to the frustration I already felt. Google helped me fix the biggest problem....you finally defeat the Joker robot, Lex and Joker are together, and Robin comes to Batman's rescue. It would freeze right there so that I couldn't finish the level. I just pressed the big green xbox button on the controller over and over and over so that the game could \"catch up\". It worked, but there are other solutions online. The other glitch was in Lego World. If I used the batmobile to go up the ramp to collect studs, the car would crash over and over and over forever. I had to start over, losing my progress.<br />You can walk or fly around a really cool Gotham City. It's pretty cool, but it takes forever to get everything and it gets monotonous. The worst were the flying controls. I would be about to land perfectly, and the controls would stop me, turn me around, and leave me quite a distance away from where I was about to land. It was so frustrating, but I like to finish things so I just kept at it.<br />It took me forever to figure out the map, but once I did, it was easy to navigate and find the things I needed.<br />I'm at close to 100% on this game, but it has taken me forever. I only get a few hours to play every few days and I've been at it for weeks. With the other games, when I was almost finished, I'd just go through finding the mini-kits, then save/finish level. It shaved so much time off, but this one won't save the mini-kits unless you play all the way through. At least I hope they'll save that way. I haven't found out for sure.",

            "question": "title: Excellent addition to the game.\ntext: Pets brings a whole new world to the Sims 3 title by allowing people to make friends with and family members out of animals of all sorts--cats, dogs, and horses are the main ones, but also birds, reptiles, and even wildlife like deer and raccoons!<br /><br />The expansion installs easily, though CC users stand warned right now that most of your object-based content will likely need updating; hairs, clothes, stuff that animals don't interact with should be fine, but furniture and decor objects are probably toast. CC's always had a rough history with Sims 3, but it's eviscerated with this patch and EP. I use a Mac for my Simming so can't really use CC anyway, so it wasn't hard to live without it. Some CC sites have various hotfixes and patches available to make your CC work with Pets' patch, so proceed carefully. I'm also starting to get some crash-to-desktop issues and Error 12s (both issues with memory) after a fresh reinstall on a decent Mac, so suspect that a lower-end or older machine might have some real trouble running this game once this expansion is installed.<br /><br />The expansion pack (EP) has a wealth of stuff besides animals. It comes with a town that is Western-themed and a ton of new objects and clothes. I didn't see any real misses in any of it. The objects are amazingly well-detailed, and the clothes/hairs knock it out of the park once again. EA's current artists are really doing good work nowadays; the original game and Store offerings weren't nearly this detailed and usable. It should be very easy to create a custom look with these objects. Of the animals, a number of breeds of cat, dog, and horse are available in Create-a-Pet; you can't make a kitten, puppy, or foal, but can adopt these ingame. Customizing a breed by making it fluffier or changing its build is complex but can be learned. Fanciful coat patterns are fun to apply and can be moved, sized, and colored as desired. The objects needed to care for these animals, such as a cat box or horse stall, are also available as objects to buy in build mode.<br /><br />Gameplay is more fun than can be believed. Much has been made of the fact that unicorns can be enticed to join the household--and it's true. Black or white unicorns float around the game, and a Sim who has shown herself to be friendly to animals can make best friends with them and eventually get them into the household, where they act like a normal horse--except one that can breathe fire, paw vegetation into being, and bless or curse other people/animals. I immediately had my teen Sim get one, and I've been pretty much ignoring the rest of the game since then because OMG UNICORN. Riding is now a skill, and adult Sims can become professional equestrians, incidentally. The new concepts are very richly-woven into the Sims 3 tapestry. (Of course, if you don't want animals near a particular house or venue, there are KEEP OFF signs for that, just like in Sims 1, but these can also be configured to entice particular breeds of animal to the place OR keep them away!) Cats are a blast in this game--talkative ones yowl along with music, shy ones hide under the bed, and non-shy ones take their half of the bed out of the middle. You can play with them with laser pointers, pick them up and cuddle them, or even just sit by the fire with a kitty on your lap and pet them. It's fun to look through one's house and see a cat sleeping on the counter. Pets' attributes are not set in stone; by encouraging or punishing behaviors, you can shape the pet's personality to a great degree, so if you want a talky kitty, you can get one!<br /><br />All in all, this is the EP I would recommend to people who can only get 1 EP and also would love to see animals ingame. It's amazing what EA's managed to bring into life, and a month after getting the EP, I'm still constantly amazed by the new things I see in it.",

Graphics are good and the user interface is well designed and fairly easy to use. There's a wide selection of quests and most of them are fairly interesting. The mapping is especially good. The penalty for dying is not too harsh.<br /><br />The Bad: Unlike D&D you only get XP for completing quests or quest objectives. There are no random encounters so you are forced to repeat the same quest multiple times to get enough xp to level up and become strong enough to face newer, more challanging quests. You have to find and join groups to complete quests because most are too difficult to solo and there is no advantage to soloing (no extra treasure or xp). Finding a group can take a long time - together with the long login process I normally I don't get to adventure for at least 10 minutes after starting the program. There is an xp penalty if a member of the group is higher than the quest level. I just tried a level 4 quest where a level 7 rogue joined us for 5 seconds and left (literally). We all suffered a 35% xp penalty :-(<br /><br />There are also some minor problems with some of the quests. If you don't do exactly what they expect sometimes you have to start again or can't even complete the quest. I expect these issues will be resolved soon.<br /><br />The Ugly: Lag. There is terrible lag as you enter new areas that can stop you from moving for up to 30 seconds. This is especially frustrating when you're in a dungeon being attacked and you can't respond. I'm sick of dying because of it. At first I thought it was my box but I managed to connect to a server shortly after it was restarted after it crashed (two server crashes in as many weeks while I was playing) and I had almost no lag at all so I'm pretty sure the problem is partially at the server end.<br /><br />I just cancelled my subscription. I'm wasting too much time waiting for the game.",

            "question": "title: Fantastic Reprise of a Classic\ntext: Shogun: Total War was the title that marked the beginning of the Total War series of games -- games which feature a combination of strategic/turn-based play on a campaign map and tactical/real-time army combat on a 3D battlefield map.  The original Shogun was a fabulous game, and, after years and several other iterations of Total War, including Medieval, Rome, Empire and Napoleon, Creative Assembly have returned to reprise their classic game, and done so fabulously well.<br /><br />Shogun 2 drips with the atmosphere of medieval Japanese clan warfare and intrigue.  The voices, the music, the scenery, and even the diplomacy are all period and region perfect, and give the game an unforgettable atmosphere.  The campaign map reprises the clans of the classic game, with Japan divided among numerous warring clans, each headed by a Daimyo/warlord.  The player controls one such clan, and must manage his clan's economy, trade routes and income, family relationships, general loyalties and roles, diplomacy with other clans, construction of buildings, military units and naval ships, spying/subterfuge/assasination/religious conversion and, of course, warfare.  The basic outlines are, of course similar to those of the other games of the series, but with markedly less \"bloat\" than we have seen in some of the more recent titles -- units are more streamlined, which makes some aspects of the battles more intuitive.<br /><br />The game, however, is set at a challenging level.  Even advanced Total War players will find the challenging settings to be very challenging indeed.  Newcomers to the series may find even the easy setting to be challenging as well.  The AI in Shogun 2 is smarter, more adaptive, and more aggressive, at lower difficulty settings, than in previous titles of the series.  This added level of challenge gives the game more depth, and keeps the player on his toes, although it can be admittedly frustrating if you have a low frustration tolerance or are more tuned to the difficulty settings of earlier games in the series.  However, if you enjoy a bit more of a challenge, you'll find Shogun 2 to be a wonderfully engaging strategy game that will provide interesting play for quite some time.<br /><br />In all, this is a must for any fan of the Total War series, and probably the best game of the series to date.  Any serious strategy game fan should give this game a shot -- you won't be disappointed.",

I had to create yet another account, download a software package, install two browser plugins, and then proceeds to be nothing more than a webpage. The website itself is irritating with a thousand different updates on every single server you played on and a bunch of other noise. The server browser is atrocious, and you literally have to exit the game and reload the browser page to switch servers. It's important to note too that it takes several minutes to load a map, and my computer is very fast.<br /><br />The game itself is a buggy mess. I have played dozens of games on my current computer with zero problems, and I had to spend hours getting BF3 to actually work for more than 10 minutes without crashing. Even now, I still frequently experience crashes, but at least it runs. There are huge balance problems, game play is often irritating and feel is sloppy. This is coming from a big fan of multiple BF games since the original.<br /><br />Almost every time I play this game it is nothing but frustration. From having to deal with the moronic Origin and crashing to hackers in game and balance problems, it's just not even fun.

            "question": "title: Great additions this year, plus what other football game are you going to get?\ntext: I don't usually buy Madden's 2 years in a row, but I caught this one for 40 bucks and I'm super happy I did.  New mechanics for throwing and catching, as well as defending passes have made Madden feel fresh again.  Big time receiver can make circus catches down field.  QB's can throw touch passes over the linebackers but in front of the safety.  This all makes defense a bit harder, but defenders have the choice of playing the ball(going for an INT), or if they're beat, playing the receiver(tackling and trying to knock the ball loose).  These are great additions to the series.  It is a little annoying how long it takes from the time you turn the xbox on until you can play, especially online.  It has to check and download rosters and profiles.  Alas, this is just the old man in me waxing philosophical about the days where you just put a game in and played it.  Madden 16 is truly legit, and it's not like it has competitors.  Go Packers!",

            "question": "title: it's pretty..but thats all.\ntext: UPDATE 4-------<br />OK. now the eye candy has completely worn off.  And I can see clearly, for the first time, that this game is just NOT a good 'simcity' at all.  The cities are so small.  And even such, I could live with 'probably', but even with the small cities, they limit the tools you have to work with.  They only let you put a little bit of bus stations, street car depos, and NO subway.  Even a small city needs more than they let you have.  These people are banking on the fact that you will be overcome with the 'pretty' aspect of the game, and not notice how limiting it is.  My nephew has a PS3 and the graphics, on this game, are about on par with his system.  Graphics are no big deal anymore.  Sorry Origin.<br />UPDATE 3-------<br />Twice, tonight.  The system crashed.  I just wanted to nix the schools in my ONE city, as so they would send their population over to city Two's way.  And maybe they could make their city an educational one, for a specialaztion.  But two, I was shut down.  So now, they lose another star, from me.  Although this is a PRETTY, PRETTY, eye candy game.  It's, simulation quality, was not an aspect they cared much about.  The MAIN work was put into the cosmetics of the game.  Not the realism, part.<br /><br />UPDATE 2-------<br />OK.  They lose another star from me.  For 3 days now, and this is the third, so it COULD continue tomorrow. The program has crashed on start up.  Requiring a shutdown of the program, and reload all the way back to where you were, usually about 5 minutes.  I really thought that the Sim-city was OVER the crashes.  If you do get this, don't have, very high exceptions for it.  Just the eye candy part.  It is ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL.  But beauty is only special until the NEWNESS wears down.<br />UPDATE-------<br />as of may 14-2013, the hosting company 'Origin' has brought some more servers online to handle the increased bandwidth needed for all the Sim City players.  And also, after the initial release, there has not been so GREAT of a demand on the servers.  So the WAITING for a place in line to get a server, is almost over.  There is still the occasional hiccup in the system, so it only gets a 4 star so far.<br /><br />good points.<br />The game 'Sim city' has always been extremely error ridden.  In every version, since the beginning back in the 1990's.  I played this on my Amiga 2000.  I thought it was awesome, but it crashed when my city got to a big size.  And so did all the subsequent editions.  Except for this one.  They keep on 'patching' the program, as problems are discovered.  And they are adhering to the job, rather well.  I've reduced my action on the game to 2 times a week.  But 1 of those times, will install a new update package, 3 minutes total.  So on, that front, I am very pleased.<br /><br />The graphics.  Absolutely breathtaking.  I think this must be the entire defination of the term 'eye candy'.  I bet it takes all the power I have, an i7 3.4Ghz, 16 G ram, but there is NO slowdown or any other adverse effects.  Well written code.<br /><br />In conclusion.<br />Yes, I would buy the program again now.  They were NOT ready to ship this on opening day, but the weather is better now.  There is still an issue sometimes with getting a server.  But if you have time to take an hour out, it'll be OK.  Now, if you made a date to do this, with a Lil' time window, that has no room for alteration.  That would not work.  But I don't have those criteria.  'I' like the program, too much, to 'not' play it.  so YES, I would buy the program.<br /><br />I cannot even play the game, because of busy servers.  I've been trying every 6 hours, for the last 36 hours.  No server,  then there was a server, it said.  But after a big dance around and around, it could not connect to the server.  I don't think there ever was a server.  Shame on you, Maxis.",

They are nearly 300 now though so I will instead get the VKB sticks since they are almost the same price right now and seem to be better quality. The option for the customization seems to be great as well with the VKB sticks since you can either buy the springs separate with the standards or have them with the premiums.

It's satisfying to type with, is extremely sturdy with the metal frame, and has the best color schemes. The only tiny complaint I have is the spring feedback while typing.

I bought it on sale recently, and it turned out to be one of the best games I have ever played.  It is definitely worth it even at full price, and you will be hard pressed to find a game that will give you more play time and enjoyment for your money.  Without completing anywhere near all of the side quests available, Origins and Origins: Awakening gave me a solid 72 hours of game play.  And that is just one character!

If you love traditional RPGs, this game is for you.  But for a few bugs that are few and far between (and mostly inconsequential), this game is nearly perfect, and even though a couple of years old, it feels fresh and engaging.<br />The graphics are nothing overly special, but the game is relatively bugless, and feels great.

The case is obviously designed to look like Mario's outfit. You're getting a nice Nintendo theme without the Nintendo price tag. LOL! It comes with a dock, the power adapter, HDMI cable and a USB-C cable. It even has a strap to carry the case via shoulders if you wish. A great on the go solution. Unfortunately, I'm going to knock off 1 star. This would be 5 stars, but I'm rating it a 4. The reason is because the dock is useless to anybody who puts a tempered glass on their switch. The fitting is so perfect for the Switch, there is no room for anything else. I can't even force it in. I can see the plug on the dock pushing up the edge of my screen protector. If I force it, I'm sure it will crack the screen protector and scratch the real screen underneath. Everybody nowadays love to put cases and screen protectors on their gadgets. That is why marketplaces are inundated with smartphone accessories, as well game console and computer accessories. Why would you not take this into consideration in your design? The dock is a big part of the price tag, and it'll be unfortunate for those who can't use it. I'll only knock 1 star since it should work for people who do not use tempered glass on their Switches, and it might even work for those who only use a thin film protector. But hardened glass protectors are very popular, and I feel this should have been taken into account.",

Which is pretty pathetic for the amount of money Your spending here. Their Astro website is horrid to find the information Your looking for. I ended up giving up after I wasted 30 mins. It would be nice if they had a in depth tutorial video to take full advantage of this product. Your basically left to figure it all out on Your own for the more advance settings.<br /><br />Mic - picks up any background noise. Pickups my fan thats not even near the mic and my breathing too. Gets so annoying trying to enjoy the quality audio when the annoying sounds get in the way of that. My 2015 Astro A40 model never had this issue. Its like they are forcing You to buy the $60 upgrade mic set. Friends say I sound fine but hear my fan.<br /><br />Headset audio - sounds amazing at times, sometimes sounds like a low budget headset, and sometimes it gets too overkill on intense action. Like its not balanced well enough or won’t process audio correctly through the mixamp. It picks up certain friends mics humming interference. Gets annoying trying to hear the game and hear humming when friend talks. Other friends mics sound great, crystal clear. This headset would take a long time to get audio just right. Any factor could be a plus or minus the quality. Its also pretty disappointing this headset is no different in audio compared to my old 2015 A40 model. Such a let down. Wished the headband was more comfy. Its very basic comfort. My head is big so maybe that might be a reason.<br /><br />The Astro Command Center is a bit difficult to understand cause theres no instructions but Im pretty tech savvy so I figured it out in 8mins. Had to google “best EQ settings for 2019 Astro A40” to even find help on that part. Glad it wasn’t buggy and did its job well.<br /><br />Music - it distorts horribly on certain songs. Pickups strange messed up audio in some songs. Stuff I never heard before. Just ruins songs. You constantly have to be messing with the mixamp to get a song just right.<br /><br />Its very lame they got cheap and decided not to add a AUX cable like they used too, to connect a mp3 player. And wished they added the Stream cable connection too. For the hefty price Your paying thats messed up its not included.<br /><br />Overall - I waited 4yrs for these and turned out to be a big let down. Its nice You can customize the EQ settings and buy the upgrade kit. Sound Quality is great but mic ruins that. You basically would enjoy these if You play single player games and / or stream them. Not great for multiplayer games. No improvement in sound compared to my 2015 model. I feel my 2015 model is way better out of the box plug in play compared to this one. Which its constant experimenting to see whats perfect / good enough. I say keep searching for something way better. This headset should be way better for what Your paying here.

            "question": "title: Twisted... but oh so good\ntext: American McGee's Alice is possibly the most bizarrely entertaining computer game I've ever played.  If you have ever wondered what it would be like to live in a Tim Burton movie, this is your chance.  Alice takes the classic Alice in Wonderland, combines it with the Quake engine, tweaks it into an incredibly dark fairytale and then carries through with style.<br />The game begins with a cinematic showing Alice fleeing a house fire than consumes her parents as they scream.  If you find this image too repulsive to accept, then this game is almost certainly not for you and you can stop reading because the entire game continues in this vein.  A booklet that comes with the game is the diary of a 19th century psychologist that explains that Alice has been catatonic in an insane asylum since the death of her parents.  The game itself is the journey of Alice through various realms of Wonderland that are now a dark reflection of the Lewis Carroll book, and is representative of Alice's subconscious attempt to regain her sanity.<br />The game screen is a `follow' view of Alice, with Sanity (aka life) and Willpower represented by tubes on the sides.  Alice can jump, climb, swim, etc as you would expect from the Quake engine.  In the course of the journey Alice finds various \"Toys\" such as a Vorpal Blade, a deck of Cards, and Demon Dice.  The Vorpal Blade (a large broken knife) is the standard weapon while all other Toys require Willpower to use.  The Toys are usually fantastically twisted, i.e. when the Demon Dice is rolled it creates a portal that a demon comes through and fights your enemies, but if there are no enemies the demon must still feed so it attacks Alice.  The Toys all have very different properties and the choice of Toy can make the difference between death and survival.<br />I am in awe of how well done the world is.  Alice is not a parody of the original book, but more like a loving sequel and the world is all the more interesting for being so like the familiar Wonderland. The game is divided into a number of chapters that have distinct looks and feels, so the Skool is a demented version of English boarding school with huge bookshelves and insane children while the forest is inhabited by soldier ants (with muskets!) and killer mushrooms.  I really enjoy each new environment.<br />I've never died so regularly in a game despite the fact that I'm only playing at standard difficulty.  Alice has the most perilous environment I've every seen in a game, in particular from falling.  The developers are not only inspired but also sadists.  This is a recurring thought I have while playing: \"I wonder what THAT is...  Oops, dead again.  Good thing I save every five minutes.\"  Fortunately, the developers gave Alice different ways to die to entertain the player before loading a saved game.  My persistence is amazing because normally I favor strategy and role playing games, and found Rune and Alien vs. Predator frustrating and boring very quickly.<br />So why am I not giving this game four stars?  Mainly on technical issues.  A patch is available on the Apple website, but for some reason the patch caused the sound on my game to become corrupted.  After many reinstalls and calls to technical support I just reinstalled without the patch, which means that all the known issues are uncorrected.  This has not been a major problem thus far, but it is annoying.  The enemy AI is decent but sometimes enemies continue to fire ranged weapons into walls when taking a step to the side would give them a clear shot at Alice.  Enemy pathfinding is also fair, though I did see a couple of Queen's guards caught on staircases.<br />All in all, I recommend this game highly.  There's enough combat and gore to people looking for hack-and-slash.  There are a huge number of mazes and other puzzles that require problem-solving skills.  The voice acting is some of the best I've heard in years.  The graphics, background music and environmental sounds are above average.  The overall storyline gets a little fuzzy at places, but that can be forgiven in a game set in Wonderland, though it is lamentably linear.  And most of all is the fantastic demented game world with a underpinned with a gripping story about the struggle for sanity.",

All other mouses paint would've been reduced to ar white smudge by now where the two clickers are, but this mouse still has a shiny coat of gloss as if I just got it brand new (which I didn't)!",

I'm not sure if the issues are due to my phone or glitchy Android drivers but there seems to be more latency when using BT on android and also get random disconnects.  Most native Android games do not include controller support but it does work well with emulators (aside from the disconnects and slight latency)<br /><br />Despite the issues using this on Android I still think this is a great controller since it works flawlessly on PC and has great battery life, hopefully I can get the android issue resolved either through drivers or system updates (my phone is low on resources and not running the latest version of Android, so its likely it could be an issue with my phone",

I began playing this game on the heals of completing Chrono Trigger (DS) and Tales of Phantasia (GBA).  It plays much like Tales of Phantasia as one might expect.<br /><br />The cut scenes and voice acting are done well for a portable game and add to the game.  The battles are real-time, but felt less tactical than Tales of Phantasia did.  Battles were still fun.  The AI for the other 3 characters in your party is pretty weak but workable.  I fought with the primary hero (Roddick) for the entire game except the final boss.  I had to take over Millie (the healer) because she didn't know how to keep the party alive and just let the AI beat down the boss.<br /><br />It's a shorter game compared to most rpg's out these days, which was a good thing for me.  I explored and did a lot of minigames/sidequests and finished it in 25 hours or so.  Personally 25-30 hours is nearly perfect for me.  The story progresses at a nice pace until the end where it feels rushed...but it all works.<br /><br />My favorite part of the game was the skill system where you customize your characters abilities.  There is a lot you can do to customize your party.<br /><br />All in all, it was the perfect into for me into the series as I know Star Ocean 2 is a longer game.

You have to search hidden object scenes for clues, and use those clues to determine who the suspect is.  You'll get clues along the way as to the suspect's gender, height, hair color, etc., and you'll use those to determine who you're seeking.  The hidden object scenes are located around the world, and you'll need to determine where you need to search.  So far, this all sounds good.  The main problem with this game is that there aren't very many locations or scenes, so it gets repetitive VERY quickly.  It's good for approximately two games, then it starts to get boring.

            "question": "title: I regret buying this at launch. I paid to be a beta tester, which isn't cool.\ntext: If you're interested in the game, wait for a few more patches to hit before you buy it. I'm a huge Mass Effect addict, I love the original trilogy to pieces and was super excited for Andromeda to launch. I've never pre-ordered a game in my life, but I eagerly did for this game, because I assumed that at worst, it would be on par with the graphics in ME3.<br /><br />Hooooly cow, Batman. I had no idea the kind of glitchy, disgusting trashfire I was in for. The face meshes were so bad I strongly suspect EA Games told Bioware not to worry about faces and to just use the leftovers from one of the Sims games. All the characters look like they're drunk or hopped up on some sort of drugs all the time - there are NPCs standing around on shuttle landing pads just.. staggering back and forth, people's eyes dart all over during conversation. The lip synch is TERRIBLE pretty much across the game. Just a ton of crap that should have been fixed prior to launch. They've since fixed the shading on the eyes in the latest patch, so it's much less &#34;Everyone has crazy Manson eyes!&#34;, and that's good. They've fixed a few of the other glitches, but I'm still finding terrible ones. The faces don't always align during convo, and last night I had a glitch where Ryder's head did a total 180 on his neck like something from the Exorcist during a conversation. I was in an area with a chasm, driving well away from the chasm, and my characters kept screaming  a swear word - which is the dialogue if you fall into the chasm, so their convo triggers are messed up. Characters talk over auto-dialogue all the time. If you're examining something, you're stuck in the examine dialogue and can't move even if enemy creatures come up and start biting you - there's no way to quit out of it or square-key skip it, and since some of the sites respawn Creepers, it's an issue. I've had weird crash issues where I have to restart the game, and suddenly my Nomad will be underground atop a Remnant pillar, or stuck halfway inside a rock wall, or on top of a building. I'm hitting glitch after glitch after glitch, and while I expect a few glitches in games right at launch, the level of glitches I'm still getting, two patches in, is just awful.<br /><br />Other annoyances: The combat dialogue is repetitive to the point of annoyance. After you've heard Jaal say &#34;We're not alone!&#34; or Vetra say &#34;Good job!&#34; or Cora &#34;Charging shields!&#34; for the fiftybillionth time in the same battle, it's really just irritating. Also, whatever targeting algorithm they used causes Cora to constantly steal my kills and that makes me want to shoot my own teammate. It happens every time I target someone, and while this may be a game mechanics issue, it could also be a character personality issue, but it makes me want to kick her out an airlock. I no longer take her on missions, she gets to sit in the ship, because otherwise my poor Ryder gets no chance at combat.<br /><br />Remember how annoying it was to have to run back and forth on the Citadel? Yeah, there's a lot of that literally everywhere. You don't have elevators but you do have a tram system that you will be constantly taking back and forth on the Nexus. CONSTANTLY.<br /><br />If you have migraines that are light-triggered.. Eladaan is going to require sunglasses. For some reason, the designers thought it'd be ~awesome~ to put in a blinding white fade in desert glare ... for every time you open/close a menu, look at a map, or fast travel. My partner has average eyes and no migraine issues, and that white flash causes him to swear in pain when it happens.<br /><br />You start on literally the worst planet for beginners, Eos. You'll have a new, upgraded Nomad and neophyte level characters.. and it's a radioactive wasteland full of rocks and slopes. Which your Nomad can't jump over or ascend. Half the missions you are assigned for the world, you can't even do until you've cleared the Vault and then gone to another planet long enough for the radiation to die down - read: until you've completed most of the missions on another planet. If you're a completionist type of player.. which I am.. this is infuriating. I hated this so much I almost stopped playing the game altogether.<br /><br />Oh, and that brings me to the map. You'll drive into a new area, and it'll print their name on the screen, &#34;Four Pillars area discovered&#34;. Did those labels make it onto the map? Nope. You have to kind of deduce where things are by the topo features on the map, because good luck remembering the names to all the places.<br /><br />Y'know how you used to be able to interact with people on your ship? You can still do that, but now they hijack you for conversations that have nothing to do with anything. &#34;So and so wants to talk to you.&#34; &#34;I'd like to chat if you've got a minute.&#34; etc nags constantly until you go talk to them. I LITERALLY had a conversation with one of my crew about licking rocks. There was no option to make a dirty comment. There was no way to escape the conversation. It was painful. It's forced interaction and it's annoying. At least in ME2 and 3 when you were notified a character had to talk to you, it had something to do with a mission or the plot. If you wanted more personal info, you got to initiate convo, they didn't hijack you and nag you to death until you talked to them about inanities.<br /><br />Romance conversations.. at least with Gil, lemme say that I am Not Happy. Y'know those creepy guys who flirt with the subtlety of someone hitting you with a brick that's on fire? Yeah.. in this game, that's Ryder. He's a lech. It's icky. There's even a point where it sounds like Gethin Anthony - the voice actor for Gil - was uncomfortable, he sounds taken aback at something Ryder says. Ryder's dialogue is written as though someone watched creepers at some meat-market dive bar hitting on people. Some of the 'heart' dialogue with other characters is decent, but pretty much every line he has with Gil is just.. grossly blatant &#34;Nice shoes, wanna ...?&#34; Not so much romance as &#34;I spent 600 years in cryo, I have lots of adrenaline flushing my system all the time because hey, combat does that to ya; you're cute and I hear you're into guys too. Wanna?&#34;<br /><br />Things I like:<br />I love, love, LOVE that, aside from loyalty missions, I can bring whomever I want on a mission. I can spend skill points for everyone while on the ship, I don't have to take them on missions to be able to level them up.<br /><br />I love the ship. I love the landing/takeoff sequences. All that effort they didn't spend on faces? They did spend on the ship meshes and sequences. They're lovely.<br /><br />I love my Krogan. He is the best thing in the game so far. He is old and cranky and takes no crap from anyone, and the best dialogue ever is when he and Liam are in the Nomad together. I want to find the person who scripted those lines and buy them a beer, because every interaction they have is glorious.<br /><br />The music is spot on. The soundtrack is, per usual for the games, a thing of shining beauty. I did get a good giggle at the recycled Geth and Reaper noises, slightly altered but still there in the game. Even the &#34;BWAAAAAAHM!&#34; Reaper Call is there, quietly in the background, but occasional enough that if that sound makes you scream and jump.. you're gonna have moments where you'll scream and jump. In a good way.<br /><br />I like Ryder. I like that they differed this character entirely from Shepard. Even at the beginning of ME1, no matter what you chose to start with, Shepard had experience and was, for good or bad, kind of already a legend. Ryder's a shiny new kid with very little experience and no stature whatsoever. You have to earn your stature in-game.<br /><br />I like the story so far. I like the goals.<br /><br />I LOVE that there is a 'Turian Calibration Tool' as an item. This, and all the other little sly kudos toward the first trilogy, make me squeak with glee every time I encounter one. And there are a lot of them.<br /><br />I like that things respawn. The worlds aren't just empty voids like in ME1.<br /><br />Even with all the things I enjoy about the game, I am still upset that I paid ~$60+ to be a beta tester. The game - even after two patches - feels like they threw it out the door it to meet a launch deadline. While I'm happy Bioware is listening to the feedback and fixing things that players are screeching about.. most of this shouldn't have been a surprise to them. Those horrid facial meshes and the wonky movements? There's no way they thought people would be ok with them. The early pre-play should have been launched months prior to release and all this crap worked out then, instead of five days prior to launch. All of this is what game testing is FOR. I don't feel like they did much, if any.<br /><br />I don't feel like I bought a game. I feel like I paid money to be in the beta tester pool, and it's detrimentally affected my enjoyment of this game. I'm kind of grimly playing through it to see where the story goes, but then it'll probably sit there unplayed until there's some new content for it that makes me curious enough to pick it up again - and right now, that would take some seriously spectacular DLC. I'm currently on something like my 22nd consecutive playthrough of the original trilogy, clunky ME1 game mechanics and all, and right now I just want to get through Andromeda so I can go back to playing the original trilogy. I enjoy playing those three games. I am not, right now, enjoying Andromeda enough to give it even a second playthrough.<br /><br />Giving it 2 stars - 1 for the pretty ships and buildings, 1 for Return of Space Hamster. May revise this after they patch it a bit more, but.. doubtful. My disappointment with this game is the stuff of legends. :(",

The only thing I can think of is Sony fanboys inflating the reviews. Here's my honest review from a casual gamer who's had a Sega Master System, Sega Genesis, N64, Dreamcast, Wii, PS3, and PS4. I'm not loyal to any brand or company, so my view should be unbiased.<br /><br />GOOD:<br />1. The small speaker on the controller isn't much, but I like it and think it adds something to gaming.<br />2. The headphone jack is also helpful.<br />3. The light bar is cool, not only for looks, but to identify the player.<br />4. Sticks are better than the PS3 sticks.<br />5. L2/R2 curve in (not as much as it should) which is a big improvement from PS3.<br />6. The grips are a nice texture which give you a good feeling of control.<br />7. Sticks are symmetrical (I prefer this).<br /><br />BAD:<br />1. Quality/design issues. I've had two controllers break with a faulty R2 button. I was able to repair them myself via YouTube videos, but as a casual gamer, this shouldn't happen since I don't play all that much (2 - 5 hours per week).<br />2. A big one....battery life sucks. The battery life is about half of my older PS3 controllers (even with the light bar dimmed all the way). I'm always having to charge or worry about if my buddy's controller will fire up since it might have been sitting awhile.<br />3. Quality/design issues 2: I just noticed the rubber splitting on one of my controller (the one I use the least!). This is unacceptable.<br />4. Not a big one, but annoying....the option and share buttons are too small and should be more triangular and follow the curve of the circle the face buttons are on (hope that made sense). And I have very small hands for a man.<br />5. The grips (though well textured) are just round cylinders and don't feel like they mold to your hand. It's not terrible, but could be much much better.<br />6. Touchpad. Love the idea, however it seems like it's barely used, which means that real estate could have been better used for a one color LCD screen or something else.<br /><br />That's it! The controller gets the job done, but for how much crap people give the DS3, this DS4 improves upon the DS3 in some areas, and fails miserably at others.",

After a small adjustment period (2-3 days), this was by far the most comfortable mouse I have owned. It fits in my hand so nicely, and the curves on the mouse don't allow it to really slip out of your hand. The clicks are nice and solid, but the coolest thing is the scroll wheel. It has a mode where you can just free scroll with it. Just flick it up or down and it will spin on its own. It's nice for reading comments on youtube videos or scrolling through your twitter or whatever. The battery is very solid. Lasts me more than a week with light use.

Highly recommended for those who enjoy exploring\ntext: I picked up Guild Wars 2 when it first came out, and at the time, thought it was only okay.  I returned to the game a few months ago, and I have to say it has improved substantially.  Many of the old mechanics have been modified/improved (added way points, loyalty bonuses, exploration bonuses) and there have been some great additions, like gliding.  I really like how Heart of Thorns got rid of the cut scenes for story progression, as it feels more natural, and thus gives a more immersive experience.  The addition of the mastery point system for max level characters is great.  Nearly everything important is linked to the account (magic find, masteries, outfits, boon-bearing items, etc.)  The lack of a subscription fee is very nice.  The gem shop offers some cosmetic/minor game-enhancing items for a dollar amount.  None of these are necessary to enjoy the game, but I can see why many folks would choose to spend some bucks on these items (mostly bag/character/bank slot increases, account-wide inventory slots, etc.)<br /><br />Some of the most attractive features for me are the map events, the fact that you never really &#34;outgrow&#34; a zone, and the sharing of resources and kills.  The map events keep things fresh, and provide decent rewards upon completion.  If you were to enter say a &#34;starting zone,&#34; you'd &#34;level-down&#34; to the appropriate level.  Of course, your abilities and improved help out and you will be more powerful than other low-bes, but you'll still earn experience and rewards.  Finally, the fact that everyone can mine the same nodes, chop the same trees, and gather the same herbs is wonderful.  There are no &#34;tagging of mobs,&#34; either.

It is difficult to just start a season and play through.  There are so many plays and formations that you don't even have time to cycle through them before the play clock expires, making it a long, arduous process to learn each team's playbook and what works.  The coach's picks seem to be pretty lackluster and seem to repeat the same plays down after down.<br /><br />The depth of the game and teaching of different formations is pretty great.  If you dedicate yourself, you can truly understand almost every aspect of the game of football.",

            "question": "title: Project Mirai DX\ntext: I played the demo, so I was sure I knew what to expect, but it turned out to be a whole lot more than the two songs from the demo. More than I can possibly cover in this review.<br /><br />For starters, the main function of the game is the rhythm game, where you play different songs with different characters, at different difficulty levels. If you've played any rhythm games before, the fundamentals will be familiar. Here, you can chose to use &#34;tap mode&#34; or &#34;button mode&#34;, where you either touch the screen, or press the A/B/X/Y buttons, respectively. Since I'm a bumbling oaf, I figured button mode would be the easiest, but it turns out I like playing with tap mode better.<br /><br />When you start the game, you choose which character you want to be, and the style of room. I chose Miku and the green room, but you can change that. The game uses StreetPass, so make sure you have an open StreetPass slot (Nintendo really needs to increase that). Since I've only had the game for less than a day, I haven't tagged anyone, nor have I used the AR cards. Dunno exactly how many AR cards there were, but seems like about 10.<br /><br />When you play songs you earn points so you can buy new decorations for the room or outfits. There's some mini-games you can play. So far I've played Go, which you activate while in Hang-out mode. There's also a Tetris-style game on the main menu. You can collect different different stamps for accomplishments. You can take photos in game, which are saved to the SD or post them to Miiverse in the usual manner (there's a new Miiverse community for the game).<br /><br />In the interests of brevity, I'm going to cut this short, but there are plenty of other things I haven't mentioned. If you like rhythm games, or just like Miku or the Nendoroid Vocaloids in general, this is a fun game so far with plenty to keep me occupied.",

            "question": "title: A micro-managers dream come true\ntext: This game was recommended to me by a friend who also loves real time simulation games. Next to the Simcity franchise, this is one of the most popular and well-received RTS games out there.<br /><br />A little backstory... I started playing Sim Theme Park (1999) back in 2000. That was (and still is) a very fun simulation game. One of the best in my opinion. I feel the mixture of real-world accuracy and fun gameplay (even though very cartoony) was executed perfectly by the developers. Furthermore, the overall aesthetics and art style of the game are very appealing to me.<br /><br />RT3, however, is a jumbled, overly-complicated mess in my opinion. The UI does not flow well, and the item menu layout makes it difficult to manage your park. Most importantly, there are just way too many options to play with! Everything (and person) in the park has a full-range of options to tweak... enough to make an OCD person go absolutely nuts, lol. I fully support real-world accuracy in these games, but I also understand that it's still a game, and I want to have fun playing it. And the developers definitely went full-tilt making RT3 as realistic as possible. Some people will no doubt love this, but I think that most people coming from Simcity or Sim Theme Park will find the game far too micro-manage-y.<br /><br />The sandbox mode is fun, but since money is not involved, you quickly lose motivation playing it. What's the point if you can build anything you want, immediately? The campaign mode is not what I expected... I was thinking it was more along the lines of Sim Theme Park or Simcity where you start with a lump sum of money and an empty park, and you build your park from there, managing it along the way to keep a positive cash flow. Instead, the campaigns are somewhat preformed, giving you a basic park that you 'take-over' management of. Not very exciting in my opinion.<br /><br />Overall, the game is not as fun as I had hoped for. If they allowed users to let the park run more autonomously (perhaps an 'auto-pilot' mode if you will) with the ability to tweak various items if needed, that would be better. Or, as an alternative, provide advice to the user on various aspects of the game (i.e. people find admission prices very cheap... people are not satisified with the quality of ice cream offered... etc). In it's current state, however, I don't want to go through my 5 hot dog stands and adjust the amount of mustard on my hot dogs.... and have to guess what the best selling price would be based on the insignificant amount of financial data the game provides real-time. The concept is great, but they just strayed too far in to the weeds without providing enough framework to allow the player to adequately adjust all of the options.<br /><br />Those coming from Simcity- or Sim Theme Park-style games beware... you probably won't enjoy this one.",

I have a teenage son who plays cooperative games on-line with a friend of his and so I let him use them for that purpose. It took very little time for these to show their strengths.<br /><br />The first thing we noticed with them is that they are very comfortable. The padding is soft and the cans fit over the ear so there is no pressure on the ear itself. They can be worn for a good period of time without fatigue. The shape of the headphones themselves looks a little odd and as such I was a little concerned that the fit would be off, but this ended up being a non-issue.<br /><br />We plugged them into the computer and immediately they lit up. I mean, there are lights on these things and when powered through the USB port they illuminate nicely. They look cool when they’re lit and the lights are not super bright so this is not a bad thing.<br /><br />The sound quality is very good. We decided to test them out with some music tracks that have a good range of sound and the headphones managed to give us good reproduction of sound without distortion and without overdriving the highs or lows. These are not quite audiophile quality but they are better than a lot of more expensive headphones I have used. The detail is there too so there should be no problem hearing more subtle sounds without cranking the volume too high.<br /><br />The microphone itself is a little tricky to attach but if one pays attention when trying to attach it, it is not all that difficult. Once connected, it works very well and the noise-canceling aspect of the microphone itself helps to eliminate some of the background noise. The result is a fairly clear transmission of sound.<br /><br />The cord has three plugs on it: one for the USB power, one for microphone in and one for headphone out. It’s a nice, long cord too, so range of motion is not restrictive.<br /><br />So far I can’t find too much wrong with this headset. The sound quality is great, it seems to be well constructed and the price is not prohibitive. This is a solid offering the midrange of gaming headsets, and it’s definitely worth a look.",

The camera isfun and includes a variety of mounts add a larger capacity micro SD card and it is fun to use.

            "question": "title: Logitech G935 Wireless Gaming Headset\ntext: I tried the Logitech G935 Wireless Gaming Headset for about two months before writing this review. I wish I liked the headset better, but after testing it, I’m still on the hunt for the perfect headset.<br /><br />Currently I do most of my gaming with multiplayer Switch games, such as Splatoon 2. I have to use Discord on my computer or phone to talk with friends while we play. But I also want to hear game sounds, so the option to have dual sound inputs is what really drew me to the G935. I connected the headphones wirelessly to my computer and used the 3.5 mm cable to connect to my Switch. A bit messy, but I was willing to accept that if it worked well.<br /><br />But it didn’t. No matter how many sound settings I adjusted, my voice was muffled when talking. I had better results using a normal pair of headphones and the built-in microphone on my computer!<br /><br />Not to mention, finding the proper button I want to use when wearing the headset is difficult. I have to feel and count the buttons, which takes my attention out of the game and performance suffers. I suppose I’d develop some muscle memory if I used the headset for longer, but I still feel like there are too many buttons. And the volume rocker is at the bottom of the earcup, so if you take the headphones on or off, it’s really easy to change the volume and not be able to hear or get a screech in your ear.<br /><br />Comfort wise, I tend to get headaches if a headset is too heavy and/or tight. About an hour was my limit for wearing the G935, or I’d have a headache from the weight of it. The earcups are actually pretty comfy and well padded, the headset is just big and I wouldn’t recommend if you have a small head.<br /><br />Sound quality is good, one of the better parts of the headset. But I couldn’t find a way to adjust the volume on one source and not the other via the headset if I did dual inputs.<br /><br />I just wasn’t thrilled with the G935 headset. At the level it’s designed for, I would have expected Bluetooth connectivity instead of a wireless dongle, better button design/layout, and better comfort overall, not to mention clear voice quality.",

            "question": "title: NCAA Football 11\ntext: I haven't owned an NCAA Football game since probably back on the PS2, but I had read really good reviews about this game. I've played a couple weeks now and thought I'd share some of the things that I liked:<br /><br />First off, the graphics are really nice. Very sleek and clean. The gameplay is fast and easy to pick up, especially if you're used to playing Madden. The time it takes to play a full game on the default settings seems pretty decent for me (ie, it won't take you an hour to knock out a game).<br /><br />Next I love the customization ability on this game. You can create your own College by using EA's Teambuilder website. Pick out your stadium, pick out your uniforms (at least 50 choices there), pick out your colors, upload your own log. I love that level of customization and hope that will be a feature that EA uses in all of their sports games going forward (especially FIFA).<br /><br />I like that you can also customize your players easily online in the Teambuilder site instead of using the controller. Juice up their stats. Change them all to Freshman if you like. Change their names manually or have them randomly created. If it's a common name, the announcers will pronounce it during the game commentary too.<br /><br />Then you can swap your made-up school with another existing school, and start a Dynasty that goes year after year (not sure how far out it runs). You can customize your non-conference games to adjust your strength of schedule. So I must say I really love that piece of the game.<br /><br />The recruiting in the Dynasty mode is a bit manually intensive though. I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing. I personally kind of like it, but if you were only interested in the actual gameplaying of the dynasty, then you may be upset at how much time it requires.<br /><br />Having played a couple seasons tweaking my strategy, it does require some devotion. You can't really auto-simulate it, or at least, not if you want a good freshman recruiting class. I turned off all of the Helper Options, which helps give you more control. I also limited myself to about 20 prospects, as this helps keep the board from being uncluttered. I preferably only add guys who have you in their Top 3 initially. I also found that if you wait around until mid-season, you can start recruiting some Junior-College (JUCO) transfers since they seem to wait until longer in the year to sign.<br /><br />The recruiting piece almost feels like a Role-Playing-Game (RPG). You check back each week to see if you've moved up on their list, or you get upset if they committed to someone else after you wasted hours of recruiting time on them. If you want to do a good job at it, it'll probably take as long each week in recruiting as it does to play the week's given game. I haven't tried online dynasty against others yet.<br /><br />Overall though, I think NCAA Football 11 is a really good football game. I agree with a previous reviewer who said that now NCAA Football doesn't feel like Madden's poor, red-headed step-child.",

            "question": "title: Great atmosphere, intriguing story\ntext: Metro 2033 is a game developed by 4-A games based loosely on the book by the same name.  It takes place in a post-apocalyptic Moscow, Russia.  Nuclear bombs were dropped and the people of Moscow fled to the Metro where they were safe from the fallout.  In the game you play as Artyom, a 20 year old Metro resident.  At the beginning of the game you learn of the \"dark ones\" and of course you set out on your journey to save the world, or at least your Metro station.<br /><br />Graphically I found this game quite pleasing.  The lighting was great for setting the atmosphere, dark tunnels with only your headlamp to light the way definitely added to the spookiness of the game. The textures looked great most of the time and will please all but the most die-hard graphic enthusiasts.  The sounds were great, adding creepy noises to the darkened tunnels.  While the atmosphere is great and sets the mood, this game isn't all that scary.  Sometimes its kind of creepy but doesn't have many jump out of nowhere moments like other survival horror games.  The HUD is minimal, your watch shows how much time left on your gasmask's filter (you need to wear it in certain areas, like above ground or you choke and die) and how well hidden you are.  For pneumatic weapons they have a gauge on them that shows how much pressure remains in them.  Mission objectives are viewed via an in-game journal which you can bring up (without pausing the game).  When switching weapons or picking up ammo the weapon and how much ammo you're holding show up for a short time then fades away.  This minimal HUD definitely helps keep the player immersed in the world.<br /><br />The gameplay is pretty standard first-person-shooter setup.  Right trigger shoots, left trigger aims down sights or is a secondary attack (such as the auto-shotgun's melee attack).  You can hold 3 different gun types: pistol, automatic, and special.  Pistols are revolvers with different attachments like scopes and silencers.  Automatics are AKs, SMGs and other assault rifles.  Special guns are shotguns or pneumatic weapons.  Each weapons type uses a different ammo type, with the automatics using 5.45 mm rounds which come in two varieties, dirty rounds and military grade.  Dirty rounds are made in the Metro and are inexpensive.  Military grade rounds are from before the war and are higher quality, do more damage, and are also used as currency in the Metro.  You shouldn't shoot these if you want to afford to upgrade your guns or other equipment.<br /><br />The game can be played like most other shooters as a run and gun, and when facing the mutants you pretty much have to dance around and try to shoot them (they usually move very fast and are hard to kill).  When you are fighting other humans, you take a more stealthy approach.  Just about any light can be turned off or shot out to create darkness.  On your watch you have a light that shows red (fully visible), yellow (can be seen if the enemy looks your way), and green (in complete darkness, only those with night vision goggles will see you).  If done correctly the stealth approach is greatly satisfying.  You can clear a whole level using very little ammo and suffering little to no damage.  While the run and gun approach can leave some players feeling the game is broken and the hit detection for the bullets to be very off.  But when playing stealthily, just about every well-placed headshot finds it mark, and just about every human enemy will die with one direct hit to the head.  Sometimes it will take two hits if the enemy is wearing a helmet (you can shoot the helmet or gasmask off their head and the next headshot will surely kill them).  Sometimes however, a silent kill will still alert all the enemies to your presence and they will start to run around screaming about how they are going to kill you.  In these cases, staying in the dark and behind cover will prevent them from zeroing in on your location and taking you down, and isn't really a problem if you have patience to take them out one by one.<br /><br />There are other gameplay elements that are added in to help fuel the survival theme.  These include your flashlight and night vision goggles needing to be charged and pneumatic (air powered) weapons needing to be pumped up.  While your flashlight will never completely die, it will dim and you can get a brighter light that penetrates the darkness further when fully charged.  Your NVG won't work at all unless charged.  Charging your battery is easy as pulling out your hand generator and pumping it for 10-20 seconds (possibly less), until the gauge is filled.  The battery doesn't deplete so quickly that it becomes a nuisance to keep recharging but just enough for you to think of conserving power by turning off your light or NVG when you don't absolutely need them.  Similarly, the pneumatic weapons are pumped in a similar fashion, and can be \"over pumped\" to get a bonus to damage and range.  The pneumatic weapons are great for stealth and are quite powerful at full charge or higher.  Other elements to add to the survival theme is the scarcity of ammo.  If you scavenge ammo you'll probably never run out of dirty rounds to use, but if you don't check every body for spare ammo or look in out of the way places for ammo crates, you could run into a problem with ammo, causing you to use your military grade rounds which in turn makes you very poor and unable to buy new weapons and other equipment.<br /><br />As for the story, it's based on the book, but from what I've heard (not having read the book myself), it is only very loosely based on the book.  The story is interesting to say the least.  The whole post-apocalyptic world is fascinating and its amazing how they've shown off the way life goes on in such a world.  Each station you go to is filled with NPCs going about their business and talking to each other.  As mentioned before you start out in your home station, Exhibition, and after fighting off an attack from mutants you learn about the \"dark ones\" who seem to be making other Metro dwellers go insane.  The Ranger named Hunter asks you to go on a mission for him, without your stepfather's knowledge, to deliver a message about these dark ones attacking your station.  This sets you off on a journey throughout the Metro system fighting mutants, bandits, communists and Nazis on your journey to Polis station.  The story is absolutely linear with only a few small choices dabbled here and there that have little effect on the storyline.  One thing that gets annoying by the end of the story is the fact that Artyom is the luckiest man alive because no matter what situation he gets into someone is there to save or help him.<br /><br />Overall the game is great for fans of the post-apocalyptic setting, who don't mind a linear game.  I would suggest it to any fans of games like Bioshock or S.T.A.L.K.E.R.  It has the same linear, with some slight exploration as Bioshock, with the great feeling of post-apocalyptic Eastern Europe as S.T.A.L.K.E.R.",

I was totally immersed in the graphics and the story line has some wonderful twists, plus (I forgot her name) is kind of good looking. Very Athletic and has a companion that invites respect, this thing looks menacing so I just admire and enjoy. Come to think of it: who really needs to go to the movies and spend almost the value of a game like this? This is as good as a movie, plus you are in the comfort of your own home, properly baked, and in front of you is this amazing and challenging game. I have always favored the Castlevania series from Konami and this one is no exception. I am sure the experts, those that play and know so much, might be able to find faults or criticisms on this and any other game. But from where I sit, just about every chance I get, I love the hell (stress hell since the surroundings are very much like I could easily imagine hell to be...) out of Castlevania: Lords of Shadow. Had to learn the hard way what I was doing wrong in order to defeat and advance the many violent situation that one faces in this game. Money has been scarce, which attests to my limited abilities for now, but once you get those experience point and start investing in the future, let's just say I can't wait for the end result, for this guy is one tough hombre of the Castlevania era. I give it 5 for value, awesome graphics (although I must say that with Little Big Planet, Red Redemption, Unchartered 2, et., the Playstation is one powerful machine), story line and sheer entertainment factor. When it comes down to it: Why would you go to a movie where so many in the end suck, when you can make the best deal and start buying games such as this for a collection that surely will endure the test of time? Who needs a movie when you can be part of this movie? Beware! This journey is long and tedious, dangerous and exciting and will test the skills and endurance of Gabriel every step of the way. Yes, it has moments when it goes into full majestic movie mode where you are kind of required to watch instead of participate but us people of the stoner age rather welcome such moments. 5 Stars, no ifs or buts, for Gabriel is indeed the man of the hour!",

When the Switch powers back on, it doesn't come on automatically, you have to hit the power button. Nor does it hold your prior color/effect settings. If you want it to be a nice lighted display in your entertainment center, you need to power it separately. Which is a pain.",

            "question": "title: Nintendo Labo is innovative and fun!\ntext: The Nintendo Labo is one of the most innovative ways to enhance gameplay I’ve seen in a long time. While I am an adult, I love building, decorating, and designing things so Labo seemed like the perfect game for me.<br /><br />The kit comes with five toy-cons you can build: two RC cars, a fishing rod, a house, a motorbike (handle), and a piano. Each one has small parts to go with it as well, like strings, rubber bands, and marker stickers. It also comes with the cartridge for the game.<br /><br />Most people are apprehensive about Nintendo’s use of cardboard but I think it’s actually better than making plastic add-ons. For one, it is easier and cheaper to replace. More importantly, it is better for the environment and it can be disposed of when children outgrow it, rather than sitting around collecting dust. The cardboard is actually quite sturdy and high quality. As long as it is not outright mishandled, I think it will do a good job holding up. Additionally, I love the ability to customize your toy-con to suit your tastes and make it unique to you.<br /><br />Making the cardboard structures is incredibly fun--reminiscent of putting Lego together. For anyone worried about the strength of the toy-con, there are actually a lot of reinforcing pieces that help make certain otherwise flimsier parts more sturdy. Cute, witty comments pop up while you make your toy-cons, guiding you through the process while occasionally cracking jokes, making it feel very human.<br /><br />The Discover section is a fantastic place to learn more about the engineering behind the toy-cons. Three characters converse and guide you through the science behind the genius of Labo. You can view cutaways of the toy-con and test the IR camera in a particular mode. There are also sections on easily repairing broken toy-con, troubleshooting, and creative ways to customize. There is even basic physics learning involved with certain joy-con--no doubt a good way to get children into physics.<br /><br />Toy-con garage is the best part about the kit. It works through very simple input-output coding. You put in an input (pressing a button for example), select an output from a list, and connect the two to make the switch create the output. I love that this gives kids the ability to make their own toys, which will no doubt spark a love for engineering and design within the next generation.<br /><br />There are a ton of different things to explore and secrets to find within the game. I highly recommend this for anyone who loves to use their hands and be creative!",

            "question": "title: Well made controller--may not be for you\ntext: This is a well made controller that cannot replace a dual shock controller, but it can make a great complement for fighting games or a solid controller for Genesis emulators.  The quality is there.  Not $100 amazing, but nicer than the typical OEM or third party controllers.  It's wired, which can be seen as a positive, especially for folks looking for low latency (handy for fighting games).  This along with the lack of sticks makes this a downgrade from the stock controller for casual use.<br /><br />For games where you need to use the d pad, it's much much better than what Sony provides.  That's more of a knock on the standard controller than a compliment for this one, but you get a great d pad.  Likewise, the buttons are more responsive than the mushy oem buttons.  These two factors along with the revised layout makes it more of a traditional fighting d pad arrangement.  As someone who grew up with old school arcade games, I prefer an actual digital stick vs a d pad, but otherwise, it's a great feel.<br /><br />The upsides are there, but console games tend to be made for the console's oem controller.  The d pad and front buttons work different, which can lead to some games not registering inputs the way you'd like.  Most games work well without issues, and anyone could appreciate the snappy responsive feel of the buttons.  I'd suggest checking out a couple YouTube reviews using this and the specific games you wish to play before buying.",

I like a heavier mouse for gaming but some people may like this. It doesn't feel cheap even though it's very light. The left and right clickers have a solid click feel and sound. The scroll wheel also feels solid. The RGB is not over powering and when you are using the mouse your hand covers most of it so it won't distract you while gaming. The back of the mouse slides in and out, which is great. I was able to adjust it to a comfortable position. There is no RGB control on the mouse so all of it has to be done through the Mad Cats program. Overall a really good mouse option.",

Want a softer color, go to the Logitech support website and download the software so you can customize just about anything you could want out of this keyboard. While you are looking through the software that you just downloaded, you can also set up function keys, disable keys and more. You can program all function keys to simplify tasks and you have 26 key rollover where you can press any number of keys for complex moves. There is also a switch, which delivers 25% more responsiveness. Naturally, the kids will want to play with all of those pretty colors.

My 5 year old loves the Lego Games, so I have a hours of \"daddy can you help me\" experience with Lego Star Wars, Indiana Jones 1 (&2), and Batman (all for the PS3).  We got Harry Potter for the expecting that the \"Wii wand\" would fit well with a the concept.<br /><br />The Good: my son loves it and has little/no problem with using the Wii controls to navigate.<br /><br />The Bad: the graphics are notably lacking. I am no graphics snob, by any means, but they are very, very poor compared to PS3.  Some may say of course they are and, yes, we expected some degradation.  But if I had to choose again, I would not choose the Wii version (and I much prefer Wii for my son, over PS3, generally).  Also, there seems to be little use of the Wii wand as a \"wand\" in the game.  I'm not sure why I expected that one would wave the wand around as if it were a real one, but, thus far (about 1-2hrs in) there is none of that.  That would be cool though right, so maybe I am missing how to do it, or some vital \"option\" to turn on - if so, then the Wii version has only the single glaring graphics issues.<br /><br />The Summary:  the game play is very fun.  The game itself is great.  My son loves it and doesn't notice any of the \"bad\" I listed above.  Just be forewarned: if you get this for the Wii, it does not look crisp, smooth, or flashy, by any means whatsoever (enough so that I bothered to write a review).",

Some are harder than others, but almost all are very fun. The Power Cruising wasn't quite up to par with the other games, so we don't play that one much.<br /><br />Our favorites, which are all excellent, are the Swordplay, Archery, both variations of Frisbee (Frisbee Dog and Frisbee Golf), Table Tennis, and the Basketball 3-Point Contest<br /><br />Wii Sports Resort is a great choice that has something for everyone in the family to enjoy.

It has actually been my all time favorite keyboard and I have used many different brands throughout the years. The G815 is basically the same style/construction as the G915 TKL except that the G815 is wired and has the ten key pad. The G915 TKL (Clicky) is very well constructed and flex is minimal due to the solidly built metal frame. Because it is the TKL version it is considerably smaller and fits well on the pull-out drawer of my computer desk and it gives me the freedom of being able to easily pull it out from the pull-out drawer and place it either in my lap or on top of the desk. I  also like the idea that I can use it with my smart TV.<br /><br />I love the media controls on the G815 and was very happy to see that even though the TKL version is smaller, they still included the media controls on the G915 TKL. If they would have removed those, I may not have been as fond of the TKL version.<br /><br />I also love the fact that the G915 TKL has two different angle settings which are nice and sturdy.<br /><br />The battery life is actually pretty amazing especially if you turn off the lighting but I tend to keep the lighting on and even then battery life is impressive.<br /><br />Personally I am not all that savvy with keyboard switches and the different benefits so I can not give any specific details as to how well the switches work other than I love the feel of the shorter throw compared to other keyboards I have used in the past. The “Clicky” keys are not as loud as other switches on other branded keyboards that I have used and I feel like I prefer the “clicky” keys vs the “Tactile” or “Linear”. This may be due to my love of the G815 that I have been using for a while which also uses the “Clicky” switches. To me the other two feel mushy.<br /><br />Overall I love this version and feel like Logitech has continued to make great products throughout the years and it is a brand that I trust! Personally I feel that the G915 TKL is a bit on the pricey side but you really are getting a solid and well made keyboard that should last a good long time if taken care of.<br /><br />*On a side note - I am having some issues with the Logitech G Hub software which I had to uninstall, as it was not working properly and now I can’t get it to install. I would dock stars for this but I think it has to do with my current PC which is not aging very well. When the software was originally installed it worked fine so I am hoping with some effort, I will be able to get it installed again at some point.",

I'm also not into competitive battling, so I won't really be talking too much about that, or things like the new fairy type. Those are topics for discussion on forums, not a game review. Since most of the changes are the online features, I'll probably discuss those more than anything else.<br /><br />For starters, yes, it is the same as every other Pokemon so far. The same introduction, pick your starter, battle random trainers and gym leaders, collect badges, defeat the champ. The same limitations of having a party of six, with each having a max of four active moves. If you stop and think, everything else is gravy: story, graphics, music, etc. The fundamental mechanics are the same, and I think that is quite frankly the majority of the reason for the franchise's staying power. You can pick up any gen game, and knowing your basic types, weaknesses, etc, you'll know how to play.<br /><br />A lot of the changes in this generation are based mostly around the online features, some of which were only in their beginnings in BW/B2W2. But you no longer have to find a Pokemon Center to participate in the online functions, they're all right on the screen. You can turn the online functions on and off at will.<br /><br />Probably the most interesting is the PSS, the Player Search System. Like most native 3DS games, this game integrates with the 3DS friend codes, so you no longer have to manage separate friend codes. You just add their 3DS code to the 3DS friends app, and then you can see their status in-game. Now while you're in game, you can see their status: player profile, badges, and other things. You can battle, trade or chat with them. Pretty much like in the old Union Rooms, but not as limited as the Union Rooms were.<br /><br />Over time, you'll see people being added to the PSS, under the headings of acquaintances and passerbys. Acquaintances are added as you interact with other remote players via the global trade, battles, etc. I'm not exactly sure how passerby's work, but I think they just are random people who appear on your screen; again, you can interact with them in all the same manners. One thing I enjoy so far is the \"wonder trade\", which is a random trade matchup: you chose which Pokemon you want to trade, and it'll find someone in the world, and you get what you get. You might get trash Pokemon, or you might get something good.<br /><br />Beyond the online features are all the other changes to the game. Music is awesome, no longer grating to the ears (altho I'm a chiptune fan, you can only listen to the Pokecenter music for so long without wanting to stab your eyes out). The graphics are fantastic, altho I do not play in 3D mode. The avatars are nicely customizable. After a long-winded review, I'll just close with that I think this is a great addition to the franchise.<br /><br />Post-game edit: I beat the champ in about 5 days, less than 25 logged playing. This is by far the easiest version I've played. Each gym, elite and champ, I was able beat in one attempt. I never felt it necessary to rethink my team, go back and grind up, or anything of that nature. I also played straight thru with my starter, Fennekin, in slot one. She was KO'ed a few times, but I never considered retiring her. With Exp Share, even my HM slaves become viable.<br /><br />I'm still exploring post-game play, and since I have tried to refrain from strat guides, I don't know how extensive post-game is yet. So far, I've found a side-arc of working in a detective agency, and found daily jobs at a hotel. I found two stationary legendaries to catch, and ran into one roaming legendary but do not know how to catch it yet. I did not find anything similar to BW2's Join Ave, or the little and big stadiums, with their daily battles, but I'm probably not searching hard enough.",

            "question": "title: Phenomenal\ntext: This is an excellent game.. Some people are complaining that it's the same exact thing as Modern Warfare 2.. Overall, it pretty much is, but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing.. I'm a strong believer in not fixing what isn't broken.  MW2 was amazing, as is this game. So far I've invested about 30 hours in this game between campaign, multiplayer and the new spec ops modes, and I still have a long way to go!<br /><br />In the campaign, you continue on with Soap and Price's story.  The campaign is fun, enthralling and action-packed.  I played it on normal difficulty and it took me about 6 hours to complete.  Again, a lot of people complain about the fact that the campaigns in the COD series are too short, but we don't buy these games for the campaigns, we buy it for the multiplayer.. However, in my opinion, the campaign is still a lot of fun.. From team-sniping with your AI partner to using predator drones, the campaign is still as awesome as ever.<br /><br />Regarding multiplayer, it seems like it has improved! When it switches hosts I've yet to be dropped out of a game.  I also get put into matches pretty quickly.  There are also new game modes which are excellent!  Team Defender is a variation of capture the flag.  There is one neutral flag with no destination for it.. Your objective is to simply capture the flag and hold onto it as much as possible while teammates protect the flag carrier.  Then there is kill confirmed, which is a variation of team deathmatch.  In this mode, when you kill an enemy you must pick up his dog tags for points.  You must also try to retrieve dog tags from fallen teammates before the other team picks them up.  Both game modes are very intense and fun to play.  In this game, each weapon has its own level so not only do you level up, but your weapons do too.  The higher your weapon level, the more attachments and camo you unlock for them.  Finally, killstreaks are better than ever!  You make a different killstreak with EACH class..  You can also choose between assault, support and perks. It adds an entirely new element of strategy when making your classes.<br /><br />Finally, there is spec ops mode.  Spec ops mode brings back missions like there were in MW 2.  I haven't played much of this mode so I don't have much to say on it, but also in spec ops mode there is survival mode!  Survival mode alone is worth the price of the game!  You can play solo, split-screen or online with 1 other player and you fight off waves of enemies.  You can choose from any of the multiplayer maps (which there are plenty of!) and you start off with a pistol and fight off the first wave... Each kill earns you money which can be used at any of the three crates placed throughout the map... A gun crate where you buy guns, an air support crate where you can purchase predator missiles, air strikes, and even AI-controlled delta squad support!  Then there is the equipment crate where you can guy frag grenades, flash bangs, turrets, etc.  They are usually placed pretty far apart and you only have about 30 seconds between waves, so you need to prioritize what you need for the upcoming wave.. You start by killing foot soldiers in the first wave that take a few shots from a pistol to put down, and before you know it you're fighting attack dogs with C4 strapped to them, juggernauts, choppers, massive infantry forces, and eventually combinations of all of the above.. It gets INTENSE and this game mode is INCREDIBLY fun.  Like I said, this mode alone makes MW 3 worth every penny.<br /><br />So if you liked MW and MW2, definitely get this.. You will not be disappointed. Again, it is pretty much identical to MW2 in a lot of ways, but I think that's a good thing.. When Black Ops came out, the number of players seemed to dramatically decrease on MW2 to my disappointment.. Now Modern Warfare is back, and I will probably never touch Black Ops again. Also, since comparing MW to Battlefield seems to be the thing to do in reviews, in my opinion this game beats the living hell out of Battlefield.. It did win shooter of the year.. And if anything else, if you buy MW3 used, you won't have to spend extra money on an online access pass like BF 3 (which is ridiculous)<br /><br />Hope this review helped!",

The graphics are quite good considering the third party view point but the UI is really difficult to get used to. Too much click in five places to get something to happen - you can pause the game at any point while doing this but it's still very cumbersome and takes away a lot of the enjoyment. My biggest complaint is that the other party members tend to stand around doing nothing. I've tried everything but the PC group members are complete retards. It should be trivial to say 'attack this until it's dead' but they stop attacking after a few seconds or if the foe moves away. They won't even follow me, I have to keep right clicking to get the to come to me. Now maybe I've missed something in the UI that would make them act intelligently but it's my review and I don't like this game. Plus I paid too much for it :-(<br /><br />OK So I just figured out I must have hit the \"H\" key by accident.<br /><br />Anyhow this is still a poor game with good graphics.<br /><br />1.

Intermediate quest points are not indicated on map or when you mouse over them so you're expected to memorize all 40 active quests?<br />5. No free movement between places of interest (Oblivion got that right)<br />6. Anvil of the void quest is bugged (party members stopped responding) - happens other places too (no I didn't press H)<br />7. Difference in difficulty between trash mobs and bosses is way too great.<br />8. Fight with Loghain is too long w/o opportunity to save.<br />9. Mage keeps going loony and thinks she's a tank.<br />10.Mage won't use mana potions even though it's in her tactics.<br /><br />I could go on but you get the point.

The earpieces are NOT optimally shaped for the ear. I'm not sure why, but almost no one makes headphones so that they are actually comfortable. I have had exactly ONE pair of headphones where the company made them wide and oval-shaped so that the entire ear rested comfortably inside, as opposed to getting squished one way or another.<br /><br />2. The cord attached to these headphones is HORRIBLE. Even the slightest brushing up of this cord against anything (such as happens when you just barely move your head) creates an awful, distracting, echoing rubbing sound up into the earpiece. It's really quite awful for a headphone of this quality to have made their cord of a material that would create this sound.<br /><br />I stuck with 3 stars because the quality of sound is quite good - as long as you never move any part of your body so as to avoid rubbing that cord against something.",

This is easily the best controller in its price range and competes with those that are 3X more. Buttons are mappable. You can save different profiles that have pre-set vibration levels, dead zones, hair triggers, and mappable paddle buttons among other settings. Really, the only negatives are that with the clickable paddles they are easy to hit as they aren't analog paddle switch-style and are just large buttons (that press VERY easy, though this could be a good thing in some scenarios) and also that the controller is wired only with no wireless/Bluetooth. I have been using another wired controller that competes with the high dollar elite controller, and this is better. The advantage the Gamesir has is how customizable it is, not only with what has been mentioned but also with the swappable faceplate that magnetically removes and attaches (though it doesn't budge one iota and is near impossible to tell that it is a faceplate). They give you a white one and a black one, and the white one can be drawn on with acrylic markers or paint and customized in that way as well! Extremely low latency (I have nothing to test with but can tell this is very very good when comparing to official Microsoft, as well as  other 3rd party aftermarket controllers). To be able to plug into a computer and modify settings, do firmware updates (and hopefully other features not yet implemented and/or realized) is a game-changer. This controller feels premium, not just for the price, but next to the other top \"pro\" customizable controllers as well. Highly recommended, and a salute to the Gamesir engineers!",

First, this has the worst graphics I have ever seen on a workout video or game. It's like they used low quality video footage from 1980 and superimposed a person on it from blue screen. And they constantly change the less-than-one-second loops of footage, I think to give it a dynamic feel, which is just annoying. Especially if you look closely at the same crab walking along the sand loop constantly. But the quality is so poor you can barely make it out. Also, why would anybody in their right mind make a yoga program that you need to press \"A\" to go from one exercise to the next??!! Or change position of the wii remote? It's just dumb. That's a mistake every poor wii yoga program made in the past & got panned for and now these people do the same thing. Also, \"inhale\" and \"exhale\" does not provide adequate instruction on how to move through a yoga pose. Sometimes you get instruction, but sometimes you just get \"inhale, exhale\". So I guess you have to look at the screen, which is hard to do when you're supposed to be facing the floor. Another terrible Yoga program I will never use! Waste of money.",

If you have not played a turn-based game in the past, it is a different experience from most other games on the market in that the planning and strategizing require thinking in a different way, and this style of play is not something everyone enjoys.<br /><br />One of the very first things that a player will notice about this game is that the graphics are absolutely stunning. Stardock put an incredible amount of effort and care into the interface, from the menus to the cut scenes. Everything is smooth, seamless and, well, beautiful.<br /><br />Although the graphics are well-done, the interface is exceptionally complex and busy. The player manages almost every conceivable aspect of the game -  economy and tax rate, research direction and funding, relationships with other civilizations, planetary production, fleet composition, trade and more. It is very easy to get lost in the sheer volume of options available.<br /><br />Gameplay starts with several choices, most importantly race but certainly not the only option. Victory conditions (more on that shortly), universe size, star cluster density, frequency of viable worlds, number of other civilizations, and a few other options are all specified at the start. After making all of these selections, the player gets a single planet, a colony ship, a survey ship and an asteroid miner.<br /><br />Every turn consists of a number of important choices. The player decides how to allocate all of the resources available and takes steps to better their position, with the ultimate goal of meeting the victory conditions specified at the start. This may include exploration of space junk (there is frequently much benefit to doing so), colonization of a new planet, or perhaps cranking up the tax rate. Once all of the desired options have been selected, the player ends the turn and a new turn begins after all selections have been executed.<br /><br />One of the most interesting aspects of the game is in designing new ships for the fleet. The player gets to pick hull type, armament, sensors and everything else a ship needs to be a successful contributor. Once a design is complete and named, any starport orbiting the player's planets can build those ships. It is important to keep in mind that some designs may not work well through the entire game but that sometimes a design should be retired in favor of new, more advanced designs.<br /><br />Gameplay continues until victory conditions are met. There are several conditions that can be specified - military conquest, diplomatic victory (peace treaties with all other major civilizations), technological victory (done through research) or even a cultural invasion.<br /><br />Every choice a player makes affects something else within the game. For example, higher taxes can cause a planet to mutiny and join a different civilization. More important, though, is how choices affect relations with the other civilizations. Most civilizations pay attention to ethical alignment and military might, and depending on how strong or weak a player's civilization can even incite a war. Finding a good balance is the key, and finding that balance is inherently tough.<br /><br />As this version comes with both expansion packs, there are three campaigns that are available for play. I have not tried any of these so I cannot really comment on them.<br /><br />This is a very engrossing game with slick graphics and many, many choices for the gamer who wants absolute control over every aspect of the game. If this style of play is appealing to you, seriously consider picking up a copy for yourself and say goodbye to your free time.",

            "question": "title: 3.5 stars\ntext: The Amazon Basics Nintendo Switch case, above all, is a sturdy and large briefcase. People may think you've brought something dangerous on board your train, but behind its James Bond-esque appearance is a fairly simple storage space. This is a case conducive to the Switch owner who prefers their games digitally stored rather than physically purchased, as there's minimal space inside for games or cases. You get enough space for the Switch console with two attached Joy-Cons as well as a Grip with two more attached Joy-Cons, space for the dock and cords and that's about it.<br />The asking price as other reviewers mention feels a bit high for what you're getting, though not knowing how much it costs to put together - and given most things associated with the Switch are more expensive than I expect - I don't knock the cost too much.<br />I also concur with a reviewer who expressed surprise at its bulky size.<br />My only remaining concern is the stability of the actual Switch inside. It fits decently into its assigned slot, but based on the seeming fragility of the Switch device itself, I doubt I'd feel terribly comfortable carrying the case vertically as it's designed to be, since that would mean the Switch itself faces horizontally within the case, and though I'm sure it's designed properly to account for that, it still concerns me as a consumer considering the Faberge egg-like care with which I try to handle the system.",

            "question": "title: A Ton of Wasted Potential\ntext: First of all, most comparisons will be to Prof Layton games.  While that is a fair comparison, this game is really a hodge podge of genres...all of which I like, but doesn't work in the simplified format they provide in this game.<br /><br />Prof. Layton-ish - Yes, this game has puzzles like Layton but it really has 5-10 different types of puzzles (Sequence, tangem, fill in the word, push blocks, find the difference, etc) that get re-used over and over.  If you are looking for a Professor Layton clone for the 3DS, I think you will be disappointed.<br /><br />JRPG-ish - You collect spirits to battle the boss spirit at the end of each dungeon.  The spirits level up with each successful usage.  These battles are okay, but far from good.  Portrait conversations and people spread across town to talk to.<br /><br />Zelda Adventure-ish - Go into a dungeon, sneak past some guards, push boxes to complete a path to get further in, with only a single boss battle.<br /><br />The story and characters are done fairly well.  They even have plenty of side quests which add more depth to the main characters and sub-plots.  The voice acting and art style work well.<br /><br />I like the detail they gave to the city.  They filled it with plenty of locations and people, but in the end it's really empty.  The people say mostly useless things like \"I love Paris\" and the locations are simply used to go underground.<br /><br />There are supposed to be 250 puzzles, but they are really just the same puzzles re-hashed.  You have to roam around the city to random points marked on the map to see if you have found the next dungeon or not.  There is usually a sheepish riddle that can help you figure where you might go next.  Then in the dungeons you wander around sneaking past guards and pushing boxes to get further into the dungeon.  There are a couple of doors where you have to solve a puzzle to get past.  And finally you battle the dungeon boss with leveled up spirits (basically one time attack cards).<br /><br />In the end, I was very disappointed.  I was mostly interested in this for the puzzles and this is definitely no competition to Professor Layton.  The concept they put together is interesting but feels like you are doing busy work just to get to the next puzzle/story.<br /><br />I would not recommend this game.",

I tried setting it down and picking it up an hour later just to make sure it was completely done with. Turns out my character started running in the other direction (opposite from where he was originally running). It's a piece of junk! And I originally thought that maybe some people were just rough with their controller and that's why it got some bad reviews, but no. I am very gentle with all my stuff and it broke already.<br /><br />I should also mention that this 3rd party controller is not as comfortable as the official controller because you need to press some of the buttons harder than others to get a response.<br /><br />LISTEN TO THE ONE STAR REVIEWS EVERYONE!!!!

            "question": "title: ***UPDATE: DEAD*** Great for normal headphones, AWFUL for Creative's own.\ntext: UPDATE 08/24/13:<br />After months of letting this sit, I decided to try again. I downloaded all the drivers and firmware, but nothing. When I plug it in, my computer notifies me that a device has been entered in one of the USB ports, but the Recon3D doesn't light up. I doubt it's the Tactic Link card in it.<br />I downloaded Creative's updater, and it recognizes the device when it's plugged in, but the update constantly fails. It's a shame because I loved it when it worked. Now it's a paperweight.<br /><br />Also, I never heard back from Creative after my last email earlier this year.<br /><br />UPDATE 04/21/13:<br />DEAD!<br />My Recon3D is dead. Or, at least, it won't turn on when connected to either my Mac or Windows computers. It's strange, because my computer will recognize when it's plugged in as any sound will try and shoot to the device, but since the actual Recon3D itself won't light up (ie, turn on), it can't connect to my Omega headphones, thus defeating the purpose.<br />I've emailed Creative to see what the issue could be.<br /><br />UPDATE 12/13/11:<br />I've kept the original review below. It turns out I was missing the card, but Creative was gracious enough to send it to me so I can experience the full sound explosion in its glory. As a company, they rock. Their products are amazing, albeit overpriced.<br /><br />Pairing the Omega headphones with their Recon3D was easy with the TacticLink (though I did have trouble at first), and the sounds is fantastic. I tested Star Wars on Blu-ray, and, sure enough, there was a huge difference from just using the Recon3D with $20 Sennheisers. Not only do the headphones make a difference, but the Recon3D does a magnificent job of imitating true THX sound. Having the Recon3D, it eliminates the cords from the Omega connecting to the TV and PS3. You only need to connect the Recon3D via USB to the PS3 and the optical cable (included) from the PS3 to the TV, and that's it. The Omega headphones sit comfortably on their rest, no other cords, pucks, plugs necessary.<br /><br />It's fantastic for console gaming, but at $300 for both, it's too pricey, considering that you can find some with slightly less sound quality for under $100. While it's multi-platform (though I've only used it with the PS3 and Macbook Pro), the price can detract some, but the sound quality makes it worth it.<br /><br />----------<br /><br />Shouldn't it be the opposite? I have Creative's Tactic 3D Omega headphones, and got the Recon 3D to pair with it. It should be easier, shouldn't it? With their own products?<br />Unfortunately, that isn't the case.<br /><br />While I have praised the Recon3D, that's only because I'm using them with my $20 Sennheisers. That's where the two stars come. It gets docked enormously for the fact that Creative leaves out the TacticLink, a piece that is REQUIRED to pair their own headphones wirelessly. Unfortunately, the two items separately do not come with the TacticLink, but the bundle does--? If you buy the bundle, you save over $75, but it comes with a component that you need to pair the items. You can pair the headphones with the Recon3D, but by cable only, and I don't have the necessary cable to accomplish that.<br /><br />Therefore, their pricing is extremely skewed, and the fact that you have to pay over $75 more for both items separately when you don't even get the necessary (\"optional,\" as Creative says) component to get the full, wireless experience, make this customer a very unhappy one. Heck, I can't even get the full experience at all because the Tactic 3D Omega can't connect to the Recon3D unless I go out and buy the cable, let alone \"optional\" TacticLink, thus leaving me behind the full enjoying experience.<br /><br />It's a shame because I defended the Omega in another review, but here's where it stops.",

            "question": "title: Good wheel for the money\ntext: Context- I spent the last 2-3 years with a Fanatec CSR on FM4 and was waiting for an affordable wheel to jump up to FM6. FM6 is the only game I play. So this review in many ways is a comparison between the two wheels. Overall, for the price, I am happy, though I am wondering if I may be more satisfied by jumping up to a Fanatec CSL.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Physical setup was super easy. Plug and play. I have a bootleg cockpit setup and all I had to do was drill new holes for the pedals.<br />- Configuration was relatively easy. Took a little trial and error, but I got it to where I'm almost not thinking about the wheel while I use it (which is my indicator of a good wheel)<br />- Overall precision and control is pretty good.<br />- Build quality is surprisingly good. The buttons all look and feel good, the metal paddles feel expensive, and the main wheel grip is great.<br />- Force feedback at 100% is strong enough to probably break wrists/fingers. For me that is useless; I dialed it down to 10% and it gives me enough feedback at that level. I've driven everything from Hondas with &#34;power steering delete&#34; to Ferraris on racetracks in real life, and I've never driven anything with the level of kickback this thing has at 100%.<br />- Former Fanatec users can save some money by getting an adapter that will enable the use of Fanatec pedals.<br />- Lap times dropped by about 2-3 seconds with A class cars around most tracks compared to controlled. Looking at telemetrics this seemed to be due to more precise braking and steering inputs. Naturally your mileage may vary.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Wheel is a little smaller than I'd like. Haven't checked the diameter but I'm pretty sure my CSR is bigger. Personal preference.<br />- No thumbwheel for advanced camera view change in car customization/paint mode/Forzavista in FM6.<br />- No bolt holes for mounting, and existing bracket hangs low, interfering with my knees when I work the pedals. May have to adjust my rig.<br />- Pedals feel really cheap (they had to save money somewhere)<br /><br />Compared to my Fanatec CSR:<br />- CSR has better mounting system<br />- CSR has smoother, more nuanced feedback<br />- CSR turns smoother<br />- CSR has nicer pedals<br />- TMX has much nicer feeling wheel<br />- TMX costs half the price<br /><br />So in summary, I definitely recommend this to anyone looking to make the jump from a controller to a wheel for the first time. However for my fellow FM4/Fanatec players you might not be satisfied. I only got this yesterday so I will give it a couple of weeks before making a final verdict, but initial impressions are good.

            "question": "title: Parts of This Game Are Fun, But Prefer Others in the Series - Here's Why:\ntext: Some thoughts on ASSASSIN'S CREED UNITY:<br /><br />* I played the PS4 version.<br />* I do not have the same frame rate issues that others are reporting.<br />* I think it's not one of the best of Assassin's Creed (AC) games. Having played most of them, I like Black Flag, the Assassin's Creed 2 games, and AC1 better, but like this more than Assassin's Creed III.<br />* This game pales in comparison to Shadows of Mordor and Assassin's Creed Black Flag.<br />* The movement in this game is often erratic. I always find that I get more comfortable with the movement in these games as I play them, but I think this game is particularly bad.<br />* The game feels buggy and glitchy overall. The animations are not as fluid as in other AC games and Shadows of Mordor, NPCs behave weirdly reasonably often, clipping, etc. However, I did not see any gamebreaking crashes or bugs which made me restart a mission/reload the game.<br />* Combat is about par compared to previous games in the series, but much worse than in Shadows of Mordor.<br />* Paris is a good setting for the game. AC gameplay benefits from the city streets, as opposed to open terrain, as in much of AC3 and Black Flag.<br />*In previous games, I really enjoyed the Abstergo/future storyline, but in the more recent games have stopped caring. The plot is overly convoluted and there's very little advancing of the narrative going on.<br />* Arno is a decent enough character though, and I enjoyed his storyline, but I wish that the rich history of the French Revolution was brought into the game more.<br />* Paris seems too chaotic, there's too much random robbing and looting going on. It can be distracting, and you'll get random events occurring during (at least some of the) missions, which can get in the way/become problematic.<br />* Did not try the multiplayer missions.<br />* Integration with the web games leaves something to be desired, in my opinion. I have heard that they are not very fun, and I'm not really interested in participating anyways. Am bummed that I have to do this in order to unlock some of the game's content.<br />* In short: if you haven't played Shadows of Mordor or Black Flag, play those first. If you like both of those games and still want more on a current gen console, Unity may be what you're looking for. Just don't set your expectations too high.  I enjoyed playing this game - just not up to the quality of some of the previous games I've mentiioned.",

They aren't loaded with options, but the basics -- namely sound and build quality – are well done considering the price point.<br /><br />The build quality in particular is impressive for the price point. These feel very solidly built. Even issues such as the cords are well done. I inadvertently gave the cord a stress test – I’ve been mainly using Bluetooth headsets and forgot this was corded. I got up from the PC and gave the cord a pretty good stress test that it passed with flying colors. No complaints at all about the build quality.<br /><br />The sound quality is also very good for the price. It’s a bit thin on the upper and mid ranges, but nothing objectionable. Good bass response which is aided by the around the ear cup design. Very good sound isolation when wearing these. It’s not audiophile-level sound, but for the price, it’s very respectable.<br /><br />The mike is adjustable and can be removed if you just want to use these for sound. There’s a handy in-line control for volume and mute.<br /><br />My primary complaint is comfort. The ear cups are covered with a mesh-like material that I had hoped would allow for some air circulation. However, it’s not very effective – the heat buildup becomes uncomfortable after about 45 minutes.<br /><br />The upper arm padding is thick but could be a bit softer. The rather firm padding on both the ear cups and upper arm, coupled with the overall weight of the headset, got tiring after a while.<br /><br />While these fall a bit short in terms of comfort for me, I feel they still warrant a solid four star rating for the sound and build quality. They are a good value set of gaming headphones that can withstand some measure of punishment without breaking.",

But this headset *always* manages to pick it up without issue.<br /><br />Other pros:<br />Comfortable to wear (although partner has issues with it being too snug for their head, I like my fit). Has a manual volume, mute/unmute, and mic volume (?) box. Semi-adjustable mic point.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Sometimes the cords wrap, at least for me. Been able to fix that with how I put the headset away. Some of the sensitivity capability of the mic means it picks up partner's voice, although this could also be from being in close proximity for our desks and their voice being distinct. Also can be mitigated by tuning down the mic level on the manual box and playing with settings.<br /><br />EDIT:<br />The quality of the headset deteriorates. The plastic of the headband snapped on both sides- just from picking it up. And the sound now has to be turned up just to hear anything. And the mic now picks up more background noise than my own voice, and has to be mic-checked repeatedly- which is finicky. I rescind my recommendation.",

            "question": "title: Day 1 Editions come with a flippable cover\ntext: Gotta say i'm in love with the game's combat mechanics (something Platinum games is know for).<br /><br />Never played any of the previous games, so this is my first Nier game. About half way threw the game I found out there are multiple endings around 26 and it kinda pushed me away from replaying everything from the start, (I have a backlog of games) but later I found out that they dont require a full 26 game playthrough unless its the main, main, game. (Like game A,B and C) (3) But they are played from another perspective, have not started the 2nd play through yet, saving it for the weekend.<br /><br />I also found out that some endings stack on your save file. For example, eat a fish that was considered poisonous and you die. Ending the game, but starting from the last save file. (Save before eating it). It saves that ending to your save file, showing which one you saw, but not ending the ability to finish the game like normal. The side endings are smaller text written. Not the main, main, ending. Just a &#34;what if&#34; sorta deal.<br /><br />I'm not gonna be heavily critical of the game, since I have no knowledge of the previous games (how they fight, map layout, system etc to compare it too) but I bought primarily because it was designed combat wise by Platinum Games. I'm a fan of thier fighting system from Bayonetta, this Nier game and the original DMC 1. I will try to be more objective. Graphically its a personal opinion. It's not a Horizon Zero Dawn, but to me the graphics are passable. I'm also using this on a PS4 PRO so the frame issues are non existent.<br /><br />*Negatives:<br /><br />*The first half of the game's open world you lack the ability to fast travel. Which means you have to walk from point A-C every single time. Which makes the game feel like its dragging. You can run, and later you get the ability to teleport to a location or use animals. This isn't a full negative, I know the previous games normally had large open worlds, I just wasn't use to that and failed to plan my target spots to make the most of the trip. I found myself zig zagging back and forth which made the game drag.<br /><br />*Some might get annoyed by the semi desolate open world. Not till later in the game when more enemies appear.<br /><br />Positives:<br /><br />*Fighting system is awesome, reminds me of Bayonetta but without the magical feel and wacky fighting attacks. You can combine various weapons in 2 sets and switch on the fly by hitting up. You can also add a heavy weapon into your quick attack slot, and light into hard attack, changing the way the weapon works. This was pretty interesting, since most would use a lighter weapon for light attacks and heavier for heavy hits.<br /><br />*A lot of things to do, upgrade weapons, quest and find out how the weapons system combos into each other.<br /><br />*The story is not that bad. Not the best in the world, but not the worst. You have to find a balance of moving the story forward, while at the same time doing side quest to level up. Keep in mind, I have beaten it 1 time and going for the 2nd and 3rd ending later to get the full experience. From what I saw so far, I enjoyed it.<br /><br />EDIT 3/13/2017<br /><br />So after being curious what the 2nd play through does. I looked into it online and played the first 12 minutes of the game. You play as the guy, and 3rd part as the Android A2. Everything carries over, including quest that you never finished. After thinking about it, since you now know the layout of everything, the play time should be reduced. From what I heard online 8-10 hours. You learn the events from the guys point of view, his missions are different and he has hacking sections. Your levels, items, etc carry over. This also includes unfinished quest. We have to assume it happens again on the 3rd run using Android A2.",

I was really looking forward to this game and I have to say....it was a HUGE let down for me.<br /><br />CONS:<br />* From the start,  the graphics are mediocre.  The characters still don't speak, there are subtitles for the conversation.<br /><br />* The lack of conversation wouldn't have been so bad...if there was SOME background music.  I thought I needed to adjust the settings on my DS because it was so quiet.  But no,  there is no background music.  The only background sound that I have found,  is when you are trying to cast a spell.  Not even your decoy detonators make noise (I know,  cause I wasted a bunch....couldn't tell if they were going off!!)<br /><br />* The controls are COMPLETELY wonky!  You are given an invisibility cloak....which is completely useless.  I found that even while invisible AND standing still, the death eaters still walked right over and found me.  Potion making is ridiculous!  I was making a potion and I was told to shake a beaker up and down.....sounds simple right?  So I shook it up and down and nothing was happening to the bar on the side (it fills up as you perform each task.)  I lost time and had to start the potion all over again.  I repeated this 5 times...and I still shook the beaker the same way (as instructed by the game) and for some reason,  it worked on the last try.  CRAZY! I found it awkward to try to walk thru this game using the stylus. I kept touching the up/down/let/right button by accident and as some of your spells are there.....I would end up unintentionally casting a spell and losing power....and sometimes brought unwanted death eater attention upon myself.<br /><br />* The levels are long and you cannot save in the middle of them.  The game only saves when you reach checkpoints.  This wouldn't have been a terrible thing....IF my game had not frozen in the middle of one of these levels.<br /><br />* I just found this game to be flat out BORING compared to the other HP games.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this game.

The battery lasts a long time once it's charged too.<br />We have used rechargeable AA batteries and charge pads for wireless controllers for the Wii in the past, but this set up on our Xbox controllers is much better.<br />This was a replacement as one of the cords we had stopped working after almost two years of play.  I am assuming we pinched and damaged it rather than it being defective.<br />We've actually ordered another controller, and I spent a little more to get the charge and play.  It will definitely pay for itself compared to buying batteries. I couldn't keep enough batteries in the house before!",

I honestly just can't stand Tidus, he's a terrible main character.  Then there's X-2.....Aside from the fact that the entire thing is trying to get Tidus back, the story and characters are all TERRIBLE.  It's literally J-Pop Girl Band The Game.  The only redeeming factor of the game is a faux job system (which are easy to level due to a major exploit) and the combat system, which is actually a really fun take on the ATB system.<br /><br />If you haven't played the games, it's worth getting this for the HD version.  But if you've already played the PS2 originals, I wouldn't bother as there's nothing new here.",

I'd played Mohaa all the way through without any major problems so I was suprised to find that some portions of this game are ridiculously difficult. I found I kept running out of ammo because the vast majority of bad guys don't drop ammo when you kill them.<br /><br />Other parts of the game are also poorly designed such as the bit where your buddy is trying to unlock a door. You get swamped by grenade launching dudes and don't stand a chance. There are several other points which are extremely difficult too. There doesn't really seem to be a good reason for designing a game with this level of difficulty. And, yes, I'm playing on 'EASY'.<br /><br />The standard cheats don't seem to work on this expansion set and I can't find any cheats online which either means there aren't any or no-one cares enough about the game to research them. Either way, the only way around these impossible sections is to jump to the next map.<br /><br />There are some cool new weapons such as a powerful air-rifle, a wimpy sub machine gun, and an excellent machine gun. You also get to use mortars, ack-ack, and other heavy artillery. There's also a good dose of humor too.<br /><br />Overall I'd say it might be worth $10 but not a penny more.",

Now, when I turn off or on my Xbox, my TV will also turn off or on.  Instructions online seemed to imply I would need an IR Blaster, or extender... however this was not required for me.<br /><br />I imagine your success/failure with this product will have a lot to do with if the Xbox works well with your TV (mine is a Samsung UN46D6000).  This, itself, doesn't seem to do much other than talk to the Xbox (it is not a universal remote).  As other stated, the volume was a little funky at first, that is until I figured out where to point the remote, then, even that, pretty flawless.  I think the trick was pointing it at the Xbox, not the TV.  The remote even has dedicated buttons to jump to the Xbox's Movie or TV sections, although I don't use this very often. Only thing I really haven't tried yet is seeing if it is smart enough to switch the HDMI source on the TV to the one the Xbox is on.",

            "question": "title: I love them, my husband ins't so fond. Overall, very stylish and easy to use.\ntext: I'm reviewing this based on occasional usage from me and regular, daily usage from my husband. I love the skin and thumb grips combo. It makes the controller easier to hold and feels better. It also makes it non-slip; there's no slipping and sliding even with sweaty hands. I have little hands, but I actually prefer the two taller thumb grips. I don't place my thumbs on top, though, instead I push them on their sides. It's just a personal preference.<br /><br />My husband, however, does not like the skins. He only likes the two short thumb grips. It makes them easier for him to maneuver and control. He's not too happy about the girl colors (we have one purple, one pink, and one blue), but since we rarely have company he's OK with using it at home.<br /><br />The skins and thumb grips are fairly easy to put on (the skins easier than the grips). They stay on while playing and look great. If you want better control and a better overall feel, these sets are a great choice.<br /><br />I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are 100% mine.",

It has default function key shortcuts and basic lighting effects. For PC only (Windows 7 or later), you can download software from their website for more control over lighting, macros, and key mappings.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great keyboard for the $55 price.

It's a phrase I like to use with my kids when they want a toy that I think is going to interest them a total of about twenty minutes.

Mostly during the main quest lines, and at times you'll wonder if you're playing an RPG or a visual novel.<br /><br />Once you trigger a main quest line (and that also considers Live quest lines) you're sorta stuck in that arc until you finish it. There's a few points where you can take a break, but for the most part, if you need a break, just close the cover rather than waiting for a natural pause.<br /><br />Luckily, the main story is not hard and the game's general progression will level you appropriately. I finished at level 25, and feeling cocky, I visited some new areas where some monsters took 50% of my health in two hits, so the difficulty is not so much in the main part, but post-game. And I haven't even touched multiplayer yet!<br /><br />And finally, one of those few games where I was compelled to watch the cutscenes.

            "question": "title: A whole new experience for me\ntext: This is my first time to use the mechanical keyboards, and I had no idea how it works. Along with the upbringing sound, this keyboard provides pretty good typing experience overall. So here is what I think.<br /><br />Build Quality & Design:<br /><br />This keyboards have pretty good build. It has height adjustor on the back and the key is slightly augmented compared other conventional keyboards. It has uniform black color but the LED lighting gives a little design kick. It has welcome signature pattern, which is also looks nice. The fond on the key is larger than normal if it matters to you, and overall it has everything you need. The keys are pretty sturdy but I think it's replaceable if you want to as well. It has black-matte plastic finish, so it doesn't look particularly exquisite, though.<br /><br />Sound & Touch:<br />To be honest, I think this keyboard is a little too sensitive on touch, I assume it is typical for mechanical keyboards. I hope it has function to ignore the light touch. It does make quite a bit of \"noise\" and I think it's very personal preference. I think you can't use this in the quite working environment, but it's very good if you like the typing sounds.<br /><br />Buy this if you want: a mechanical keyboard on budget. It's 20% off so the price is very competitive<br />Don't if you want: some mechanical keyboards with low noise. I know there are other products that provide this feature, but they are much more expensive than 20 something dollars.",

            "question": "title: Disappointed\ntext: I really don't see why Valve would even sell this disc package, as none of the games are actually on the disc. You have to download all of them. So really all you're paying for is the piece of paper with the activation code that comes in the DVD case. There are four games in this package, each requires a download of around 2GB ~ 4GB+ to install.<br /><br />Ok, I should have known better. I'm one of the many people that even today who don't have high-speed broadband. I live in a rural area that isn't served by any of the regular ISPs. So I make do with dial-up and a cellular 4G MiFi service. Sure the 4G is high speed, but I'm limited to 5GB a month. So to get just one of these games, I would have to use up the bulk of my monthly data plan, or spend $10 per GB to buy extra. Which is why I ordered the physical box package, so that I wouldn't have to download anything. It really makes me a bit angry to find out that this disc was intentionally created by a company without the actual content on it. I could understand if they were just doing downloads to save the cost of a physical package (DVD & case), but they're not.<br /><br />I'm sure these are great games, but since I haven't been able to play one, I'm just giving them an \"OK\" rating. Maybe some day I'll be able to download them and come back and give them a real review.<br /><br />At least the activation code did work, I see from reading some of the other reviews that is not always the case.",

            "question": "title: Razer Kraken Pro v2 50mm driver 2017 white model\ntext: I've read some of the older reviews tied to the 40mm models where they say the wiring was weaker and prone to fail. I bought the newer 50mm drivers and they seem to have upgraded wiring. They feel insulated, instead of the slippery wire you see on headsets or basic cables.<br /><br />The headset is loud, clear, and you hear and feel the bass. I tested these on a computer with no special enhancements or 'effects' and they have excellent sound. The volume goes up pretty high too. People had no issues hearing me in a video call I made to test the mic. So the mic was also upgraded in the newer models. It feels high quality, heavy as in well built but not overly heavy while wearing. It looks and performs like a premium device. You can mute the microphone by sliding a button on the cord, if you dont, it stays active even when inside the headset. Clearly marked red for no sound making it easy to quickly turn on and off at a glance.<br /><br />I had to return these once I tested these on my Playstation 4 Pro, which was the original reason I bought them for. The reason I rated a 5 star is because it does deliver, and works as advertised on a Playstation 4 console, computer, cell phone etc and has excellent sound and bass. They also seem to have fixed the complaints from the older models. The problem for me was the controller of the Playstation 4 that it plugs into. NOT THE HEADSET. The controller lacks a powerful amp built in for headphones.<br /><br />What ends up happening is the high quality, volume levels, bass etc all take a dive. It ends up under performing because the controller does not have a built in amp or DAC to feed it power, so the controller feeds it compressed bluetooth audio on top of not having a built in amp. The difference in sound quality on a computer, sound system and even my LG v20 smartphone (which has a Hi-Fi Quad DAC) is like night and day. It sounds like a basic headset.<br /><br />It's okay, but for the price and I was only planning on using these on a Playstation 4 I decided to return them. I can see how it would be phenomenal for computer gaming which Razer uses computer gamers on thier website as spokesperson and streaming films on a laptop or computer. In my case, I only use my computer for basic internet use, not gaming or streaming. (I leave that to my home theater system).",

            "question": "title: Great for Watching Special Effects Movies, Overall Excellent But Pricey\ntext: Here's my review for what it's worth:<br /><br />First, I'm a movie and music buff, not a gamer, and I usually prefer earbuds rather than headphones for my Samsung Galaxy 4S Blaze. I typically prefer lightweight, easy to pack headphones when I travel and am a little mystified about why there's been a throwback to much bulkier versions, like the ones from the 60s and 70s. Maybe I'm just getting old, but I don't see how bulk is better.<br /><br />That said, I have to say I felt very cool wearing these red and black headphones. They are almost a dead ringer for the trendy Dr. Dre Beats headphones lots of kids wear these days. However, upon closer inspection, I can see these are so much better made, with small details that really make a difference in comfort and function.<br /><br />PROS: Overall solidly made, though the plastic parts make me wonder how much use it will take before those vulnerable parts break. Judging by the other reviews I've read of this product, I have reason to be concerned.<br /><br />Sound quality is excellent. I watched \"Titanic\" and \"The Impossible\" on my Windows PC and the surround sound was fantastic. I'm reserving these headphones for movie nights when disaster films are on my agenda.<br /><br />Music. You can adjust the timbre, bass, etc., using the Bluetooth app.  While I'm not a professional musician and there are those of us out there who are more discerning, I was quite impressed with the depth and clarity of the jazz, classical and rock tunes I tested these with. Bass started to crap out at a very high volume, but I would rarely use it at that extreme.<br /><br />Comfortable to wear and lightweight, despite the size. Your head feels less sore because of a cushion cleverly stitched on the underside of the band that rests on top of your head.  I can see myself using this on an airplane for hours, and the manufacturer encourages this by providing an adapter for flight use. Clever.<br /><br />Easy to fold and store. Again, I'm not a fan of big headphones, so I'm glad I can shrink them down whichever way I can. I do wish, however, that the manufacturer had made the headpiece bendable and foldable as well, not just the muffs. For $300 why not?<br /><br />Versatile. I like the fact it can be used like an ordinary headphone with a cord, used wirelessly for your cell and once charged, pumped up with surround sound for movie watching. Whatever situation you want, these headphones offer it.  It comes with Bluetooth, USB, and 3.5mm jack cords.<br /><br />The buttons are conveniently placed, though all of them are located on the right earmuff - if you're a lefty you'd have to switch. I especially loved the fact that I can control the volume by simply reaching up to the headphone and rolling the dial.<br /><br />CONS: The included USB cable is kind of thick, which is good for durability, but it's also kind of short. I would have liked it to be longer.<br /><br />The storage case has a zipper on the back, making you assume the cords would be naturally stored there. But the compartment is tight and stiff, and it makes the package bulky.  I ended up wrapping the cord up with a pipe cleaner and putting it inside with the headphones. Not sure what I would use the exterior zipper compartment for.<br /><br />Noise cancellation. The noise cancellation was OK but not as impressive as the BOSE headphones I used to own. I feel as if the noise cancellation works mainly because the earpiece covers the entire ear rather than having a true noise cancellation mechanism.<br /><br />I still have to test these using SKYPE, but for now I'm impressed with these. For $300, I would not expect anything less.",

            "question": "title: Good For The Price\ntext: Since there seem to be reviews for multiple models of Zalman keyboards here, I want to state up front that this review is for the Model ZM-K200M, which currently sells for somewhere in the $13 range here on Amazon. Obviously, Zalman has quite a wide-range of keyboards as they span from the cheapest (the one that I am reviewing here) to one that currently sells for over $100. I can't imagine paying $100+ for a keyboard, but prices do tend to be exaggerated when it comes to the PC gamer market.<br /><br />Obviously, for $13 I was not expecting a lot of bells and whistles. Just something that wouldn't fall apart instantly and was as simple to use as any other keyboard. There are certainly cheaper keyboards here on Amazon, but most are not ones I would want to use on a daily basis. The thing that sold me on this particular model was that it is not only cheap but comes with a number of multimedia buttons that I figured would come in handy.<br /><br />I am not super-impressed with the keyboard action, shape of the keys or the short and stubby ENTER key, but unlike an even cheaper multimedia keyboard I bought here a couple of weeks ago (which I gave one of my very rare 1 star reviews) this one actually works.<br /><br />Going into a little more detail, there are no instructions that come with this model. Fortunately, it is largely a plug-and-play type of device though. It is pretty much self-evident what the volume control keys do, but others such as the Home and Mail keys are quite a bit less obvious. From what I can tell, the Home button simply takes you to whatever is set as the homepage in the particular browser you are using. This seems to work for Chrome and Firefox on Windows 8.1. I can't speak for other browsers or operating systems though. The Mail button only seems to open up a new browser window for me. There is another button with the image of a computer on it that seems to open up an instance of Windows Explorer. Another opens up the Calculator program. All of the audio controls seemed to work fine on my computer. Again, I have to caution though that there is no guarantee that these buttons will work with your own version of Windows, Mac, Linux, Android or whatever other OS you are running. The keys are not programmable in any way, to the best of my knowledge.<br /><br />Construction is about what you would expect at this price range. The body is 100% plastic. It is very light, but not so light that it moves around when you use it. Neither is it so flimsy that I would expect it to break after dropping it from 3' off the ground. It is not a mechanical keyboard, so it obviously is not as responsive as you would expect from a more expensive model with that feature. At least the keys are not &#34;mushy&#34; like some others I have seen though. The USB cable seems long enough for normal use and the cabling uses a reasonably thick gauge. Honestly, it isn't something that I would want to spend hours at a time typing on, but it is good enough for most uses.<br /><br />All things considered, this is an excellent value at its current price. Compared to most keyboards I have tested in this price range it has to be considered of above-average quality. I feel that I have definitely gotten my money's worth.",

            "question": "title: The Bad with the Good\ntext: This is one of the newer Nancy Drew games, and there's both good and bad to it.  I'll start with the good: the atmosphere of this game is great- very creepy.  An old Irish castle after dark is bound to be spooky, and indeed it is.  The graphics when inside the castle are also fantastic- high resolution, lots of detail.  You really feel like you're in the castle.  Part of the castle has been blown up, and it was never really clear why someone was staying in a room with half the roof missing, but we'll hold that thought until we get to the plot.  Other pluses of this game- it's a fairly long game to get through, and some of the puzzles were quite challenging.<br /><br />On to the negatives: the most important one is the plot.  Quite simply, there isn't much plot- Nancy is searching for her friend's missing fiance, but beyond that, we get little plot development.  On the same note, I found the ending to be quite unsatisfactory.  I don't want to give anything away, so I won't go into to detail, and will just say that the ending severely interfered with my enjoyment of the castle's atmosphere.  Also, I was unhappy with the outdoor navigation in this game.  Outside the castle the player controls Nancy from above, meaning that the graphics are quite simplistic, and it's more like an arcade game than a mystery.  I much prefer to see the game through Nancy's eyes.  In sum, Nancy Drew addicts will definitely want to play this game, and there are certainly things to recommend here, but it's not one of the better Nancy Drew games.  The first third of the game is decidedly the best part, and then it starts to go downhill.",

            "question": "title: A Few Frustrations But Overall Great Gaming Experience So Far (And Some Things I Wish The Instructions Said)\ntext: My entire family is into gaming and other applications that use headphones and speakers, so I was very interested in try out the Siberia P800 series wireless gaming headphones.  There are a lot of excellent highly technical reviews out there for these, but I intend to approach these headphones for someone who is not as into gritty tech details as they might be into practical every day applications.<br /><br />I am writing this review for those who really want to know about products prior to purchase.  I am as detailed as I can be without being overly so, because I want to provide information that I would like to know before purchases.  This is an expensive purchase, so it deserves some explanation and time given to research.<br /><br />WHAT COMES IN THE BOX?<br />The box that these come in is excellent.  It is sturdy and you can keep it for storage of the extra cords and parts if you like.  Inside the headphones come carefully pressed into a molded insert.  It comes with a wireless transmitter box, every cord you might possibly want to connect it to the Playstation, PC,or Xbox.  It also comes with a mobile cable and analog cable for use with TV or mobile device.<br /><br />The startup guide is, well, let me say really not as good as it should be with an expensive set of headphones like this.  For visual learners, you might have some issues unless you are a real techie.  There are no pictures of the back of the transmitter box or of the back of the playstation (or other items) you want to connect to so if you are not really good at understanding what goes where, you might have to look up online somewhere how to hook this up to your console or other devices.<br /><br />WHAT ARE THE HEADPHONES LIKE?<br />The headphones themselves have a cushioned top and small ear covers on them.  The retract and get slightly bigger, but not a huge amount.  The top is cushioned and they hold onto the had pretty well, at times feel a bit tight.  That will loosen up over time, I am sure.<br /><br />The left ear pad has a retractable mic in it.  When the mic is turned on, a red ring lights up.  The disc on the outside of the left ear pad also twists off and that is there the lithium battery is put.  When you want to replace, you quickly twist off the cover, replace the battery and you are good to go.  There are two arrows that line up for you to replace the cover quickly so you don't have to fumble with it in a hurry to continue your game.<br /><br />The right ear side has the on off switch on it located just slightly toward the back of bottom of the circle.  If the ear pad was a clock with 12 at the top and 6 at the bottom and 9 toward your front with these on, it is about at 5 o'clock.  To turn it on, you press for about a minute or so.  The switch will light up.  If you want to turn on the mic, you tap the same switch once and the mic goes on.  Tap again and it goes off.<br /><br />On the right ear side, there is also a control.  It is a wheel which controls volume, but when pressing it, will change the menu on the transmitter box.  Then if you move the wheel it will scroll the menu.<br /><br />The ear pads do fold flat which makes them a bit easier to store when not in use.<br /><br />I also find that the longer I use these, the more comfortable they seem to become- I imagine they will continue to loosen up over time.<br /><br />HOW DOES THE TRANSMITTER BOX WORK?<br />I tested these headphones out on a PS3.  I found very little on the internet about using these headphones with a PS3, so knowing that many still use the PS3, I wanted to test using that gaming console first.<br /><br />SET UP WITH PS3<br />Optical cable- plug in to optical out on PS3 in back then plug into optical in on the back of the transmitter box.<br />USB- plug in mini USB side of the cable to the transmitter box and plug the regular USB side into the front of the PS3<br /><br />POWER - this is optional.  The power plug can be plugged in where it says DC but keep in mind that means the transmitter box will be on at all times.  If you prefer that it turns off when your PS3 is off, then don't use it.  The advantage of the power plug is if you want your battery to charge up when the unit is not on, you can have it plugged in for that. Once done, you can still remove the power plug until needed again.<br /><br />SIDE SLOT<br />This package comes with an additional battery.  One battery had a single bar of charge on it and the other had two bars of charge on it.  So, while using on, the other is charging in the box.  I found that with the power plugged in, it took about 45 minutes to reach a full charge or so.  One battery took almost an hour.  The battery pushes in and locks into place while charging, and then if you push on it again, it will dislodge and come out so you can use it and replace with the other one if you like.<br /><br />FRONT PANEL<br />The front panel has a white light up design.  It shows the battery charge, that the headphones are on and if you are using gaming and voice and the balance of the two.  There is a dial on the right and a back button to the left of that.  When turning on the headphones, I get a light that shows they are on then a quick large display of battery power left in them, and then it goes to the screen that shows me PS3 and how much volume is being used at that point.  It will also show me the current battery charge of the battery that is charging on the side of the unit too so I can keep track of when it is ready to use should I need it.<br /><br />The menu is pretty simple to adjust.  You press the button to change menu and turn the dial to run through it.  There are presets for equalizer and you can also set custom.<br /><br />WHAT THE DON'T SAY IN THE INSTRUCTIONS<br />Call me dumb if you want, but although I have programmed computers and done a lot of technical work, I guess I was having a dull moment when I set up these headphones.  I could not get them to work.  I went through every setting over and over again and just could not make them work right.<br /><br />Since I have never had headphones on my PS3, (I am the only one who hasn't) I did not realize that I had to change the settings in the sound menu.  I should have, but I didn't remember.  So, after much looking around, I finally found the setting that has to be changed.  There is no mention of it at all in the instruction book.  Since this review is geared more toward the casual gamer, I thought you might like to know that small important fact.<br /><br />You have to go into the PS3 settings menu for sound and pick either the optical sound or you can have both going if you like- through the TV AND headphones.  I like to do that when the family wants to be in the room and see what is being played but I want to hear details of sound you normally don't catch on just the TV speakers.  You just have to remember to change the settings when you change how you prefer to transmit the sound.<br /><br />HOW WELL DO THESE HEADPHONES PERFORM?<br />I am going to have to really work with these for a while to find the ins and outs of them.  My first impression of them was awful.  I really was disappointed.  There was hissing, crackling and all sorts of noise with sound effects on various games.  The music seemed fine, but every time there was an explosion or some sort of noise that was supposed to be electronic in nature, the headphones had so much other noise in them it was distracting and annoying.  I messed with volume and settings and everything and it just didn't get as good as I thought it should have.<br /><br />I kept on, however, changing to various games.  As I moved through all sorts of different games, I realized that some games must be designed with engines that do not seem to transmit clearly over the wireless headphones.  They just are awful.  Then other games seemed to be clear and a lot easier to play.<br /><br />DOLBY<br />So far, I have had the best results when removing Dolby on all of the games I have tried.  I am not sure if that is because the headphones are designed for 7.1 and the PS3 is designed for 5.1, but it seems to be more muffled with the Dolby on and there are more annoying features that come up with sound effects.  I will continue to play with this and see how to make it work if I can.  I will update this review at that point.  We have several different gaming consoles we can try these with, so over time I will elaborate if I find solutions or differences.  The listing on these headphones does specify that it will work on both PS3 and PS4 so I plan to see what I can find out about this over time.<br /><br />MUSIC<br />I have watched videos on these headphones and found them to be excellent.  I can hear all sorts of nuances that I did not catch on just the TV speaker.  I watched them via Netflix and also Bluray on the PS3.  Sound was much better than some games.  Like I said, however, it could just be the software used when developing some games that does not translate as well into the headphones as others.<br /><br />I do want to point out, that these are GAMING headphones.  They are not going to be the top of the line for music listening, so if that is primarily what you want them for, they probably will not be what you want.  For the variety of needs I have on the PS3 of videos to music in games and movies, they are surprisingly good.<br /><br />MICROPHONE<br />I have not had the opportunity to test out the mic yet with other players.  I will update as that opportunity presents itself and will comment on performance during gameplay.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />So far I really like these headphones but have a few issues with them.  Some games do not sound right in these at all, and others sound beautiful.  That is not always the fault of the headphones, but it does make for annoying experiences in some games.  The design of the headphones is nice and I do love how they work when they work well with games.  The transmitter is easy to use and battery life seems a bit shorter than 20 hours, but I like the fact that you can keep a battery charging while playing so when you need to replace you can.<br /><br />I also like that you can opt to have the power on to them while the PS3 is off so you can recharge battery, but then unplug it so that it only turns on when the PS3 is on too.<br /><br />For the price, I have rated these four stars at this time.  As I continue to use them and learn more about them and the ins and outs over time, I will update and amend my rating if need be.<br /><br />FUTURE UPDATES<br />I plan to test these out with other games as well on my PC games as well as tablet in the future and will comment on those experiences as well.<br /><br />GAMES TESTED SO FAR  (more coming soon)<br />Monkey Island (newest one)<br />Hydrophobia<br />Zen Pinball<br />Peggle<br />Planet Minigolf<br />Spellunker HD<br />Beyond Two Souls",

We just searched for Nintendo Switch Lite cases and picked one out. Initially, we got one of those soft TPU ones, but then we realized the top is exposed. So we continued searching and we found this listing. If you want FULL body protection, these 2 piece hard shell cases are what you want. However, you should consider this \"con\" before making your decision... You see the Switch buttons and directional pad protrude above the surface only by a little, so by placing a case layer on top, it makes the buttons almost feel flush to the surface. It's not completely flush, they are still raised above the case, but barely. You will need to feel for yourself and decide if this is right for you. I still give the case 5 stars because it does the job, and includes 2 glass screen protectors and cute thumb grips. A lot of bang for your buck!",

One of the best AAA games out there right now. The story in general once you start it will be impossible to let go of and not finish it. They covered all past games and Nate's adventure around the globe. They show a side of him that deals with everyday life for everyone. Showing his normal life now vs his global treks around the globe. It really makes you see how everyday you wake up like a robot and do the same over and over again and not even notice it. However you see things from his perspective. Anyways, I have not completed the game but currently working on it and in chapter 11 and was blown away by the chemistry all the voice actors have, I would say this surpasses Uncharted 2. The music goes with the flow of what is happening inside the game which really sucks you into the storytelling and action sequences. I have nothing negative to say on it.<br /><br />Multiplayer I was impressed with. Everything in game can be bought or unlocked by using multiplayer points won in game. The only thing is the points unlock items randomly or paying for points to allows you to select them. All stages are free to avoid dividing the community.<br /><br />The MP plays like a mix of The Last of Us and Uncharted 3. You can revive downed allies like TLOU however they have boosters that can be bought in game (gun upgrades, more bombs, helpers etc) I liked the fact that every time you buy an &#34;upgrade&#34; inside the game (RPGs, GUNS etc) they cost more the next time so it avoids being abused. They have  a section that teaches you how to use the new items or moves (hooks, one hit kill charge, bombs , mines etc) standards Deathmatch and capture the flag type modes. They also have a section for ranked matches online instead of friendly. It still 'feels' like an uncharted game when playing online similar to UC2-3.<br /><br />I loved The Last of Us but Uncharted has always been fast pace and I was afraid that they would slow down the online in UC4. This time Naughty Dog found a good mix between fast pace action with timing and semi planing similar to (TLOU) so that made me happy. This time the online is fun and feels challenging not just run and gun. The online is also stable (I have 100 down and 26 up) results of online stability varies case by case but even a friend who has 50 down and 6 up stated that it was very stable.",

My initial intent on the review was to indicate that the game wasn't as bad as others have made it out to be.  Now I'm hooked!  The story continues to pick up, and there have been a few times when I find myself very much impressed by the sound and graphics.  Over all, SE/Obsidian did a fine job on this one!  Everything seems very fluid, and over all, I'm having a blast!<br /><br />Previous Impression:<br />I'm seeing some negative reviews on this, and I'm rather surprised.  This game pretty much delivers what's advertised.  When I saw the initial trailers, I expected a clone of Diablo/Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance, and that's exactly what you get.  The graphics and sound are far sharper than it's predecessors, and the play control is solid.  I'm about 5 or 6 hours into the single player game as Lucas.  The story is fine enough (these types of games never have mind-blowing story lines anyway) and the characters are about what you'd expect. I'd say the voice-actors are about on par with Diablo/BG:DA.<br /><br />Is this \"Game of the Year?\"  Probably not.<br />Is this a fun game?  Definitely!<br />Does this game offer anything new to the genre?  Not really.  It's just prettier and more polished.<br /><br />If you've enjoyed previous dungeon crawlers, you might want to give this one shot.<br /><br />Edit: 8/11/2011<br />I still really enjoy this game, and I'm rather disappointed by its over-all reception; it's a fun dungeon crawl, and I'm not sure why people expected anything else.  Granted, it's a bit short, but there is some replay value here (thank the Trophy system for that.)  I'd expect the average person to play through it in about 10 hours.  Some grinding will be necessary if you want an easier time with the end.  Trying to complete the game when you're in your low-mid 20's can be tough for some.  If you're short on cash, this is definitely worth a rent. It's certainly easy enough to complete in a weekend.",

It fits the sleek black aesthetic of the Joy-Con controllers and the box itself is akin to official products as this is an officially licensed peripheral.<br /><br />The Grip itself works well and sits comfortably in the included dock.<br /><br />Before purchasing this item, I recommend strongly considering how you use your Switch. If you primarily play with detached Joy-Cons on the TV, chances are it is no easier to leave them attached and charging on the Switch unit itself versus in the charging grip if you won't in fact be utilizing the grip for play. This is because the Grip includes as a benefit a top shell piece for the L/R buttons, and as a small side effect of this, the Joy-Cons can't be as immediately slid in or out of the Grip. Whereas when affixed to the Switch itself, the Joy-Cons slide right out in one step. And if you play on the go primarily or use the Pro Controller, the product will likely offer minimal benefit. For those who prefer their Joy-Cons in a grip, the PDP Grip is a bit comfier and more ergonomically friendly than the default grip as it offers larger shoulder buttons.

            "question": "title: Awesome controller but not customizable\ntext: I have owned this controller for almost 2 years now and here's my honest review:<br />The design and layout is exactly what you expect since it's based off the Xbox controllers. The mechanical buttons are what drew me to this item and they did not/do not disappoint! I have never felt such smooth button movement in the 20+ years of video gaming. The amazing part is, 2 years later they still feel the same as they did day one!  However, the print on the buttons has completely worn off. The final important pro of this controller is how securely the cable connection is into the controller. The connection points on wireless controllers are extremely weak, as they're just meant to be plugged in to recharge. Try playing with them connected and you usually knock out the cable once or twice a session. That DOES NOT happen with this. Once you plug it in it takes quite a bit of effort to remove. You definitely can't knock it out by accident.<br /><br />Now the cons, and the reason why I knocked off a star. First, if you need replacement parts, good luck. Razer, nor any 3rd party make any spare parts for the controller. They have a few spare parts that they get from returns and things that they will sell you, but it's hit or miss if they have the part you need. Second, there is no way to remap the paddle buttons/spare buttons to keyboard binds. So if you play on PC but enjoy using a controller, you are limited to what you can do with it. For example, I play FiveM (GTA 5) often, and because there are so many functions, most important commands are bound to a key, not a button. If you have an Xbox or PS controller there is plenty of 3rd party software that allows you to remap one of the paddles to a keyboard key. Neither con alone was enough to knock a star off, but together they do.<br /><br />Overall I have thoroughly enjoyed and continue to enjoy this controller. But, if Microsoft decides to release the Elite series 3 with mechanical operating buttons, bye bye Razer.",

I REALLY appreciated that this game has tutorials for you to accomplish before being thrown into the missions.  I specifically bought this game new because I thought I would need to look at the instruction book to figure out how to play.  The instruction booklet was completely useless. The tutorials are all you need.<br /><br />You start off with a few people in your military (heroes, archers, cavalry, etc.)  You also have a builder who is used to build up your base,  your farms, your mines.  Every turn, you try to advance your borders a little further by challenging the armies of your enemy. Each member of your military has specific strengths and weaknesses (which are shown on the screen when you select them).  When you obtain enough favor and materials,  you can advance an \"age\".  At that point,  more god powers will become available and you can upgrade your military.<br /><br />I have been playing this game (as I have time) over the last 5 months and I haven't even scratched the surface with all that it offers.  I finished the Egyptian section and I am almost finished with the Greeks.  I like that there is a lot of strategy involved in this game.....you don't just finish a level and win.

I average about 400 hours per game even though I'm no pro.  Pokémon Omega Ruby is fun.  It's the most fun I've had with a Pokémon game since Soul Silver (my favourite), and it is the best looking to date.  I thought X was mind blowingly awesome but all the little improvements in this one, even minor things like how great reflective surfaces look, how tree lines have more detail and depth, how Pokémon attack animations look amazing is enough to push this game to the top of my list.  This is not a stale remake but of course it follows tried and true Pokémon formula.  It's a better game over all in every category than X with tons of content.<br /><br />A FEW things I really like:<br />DexNav<br />Pokedex (homage to the GBA is awesome and the dex functions really well and is fun to use)<br />Graphics--true improvement in every aspect, even NPC models are a delight--battle animations are magnificent<br />2 different bikes that actually function completely differently--mach and acro<br />Pokemon Contests---while not as fun as Pokeathlon it's still great<br />Transferring Pokémon from other games considering they are \"newer gen\" Pokémon<br />Secret bases--customization is awesome<br />*Also, it's faster to heal your Pokémon with nurse Joy...battle animations have been amped up to be faster.  Other than sneaking up on Pokémon, the rest of the game things can happen faster, including how fast you can go on the bikes.<br /><br />To be fair---here are two things I really don't like--<br />1. Music--it sounds great but when changing areas, entering buildings, especially going into battle, it often seems like a jarring change instead of a smooth transition...it seems pretty major to me and is very annoying, maybe I'll get used to it<br />2. Not being able to customize your character is a step back for a game that took SO many steps forward.  Even if they had limited the options, there should have been character customization options.  People who play hundreds of hours get pretty tired of seeing the same character.<br /><br />Wish--still wish Pokémon could follow my character.  Simple but very great thing about SS.<br /><br />Note....these Pokémon don't suck as some people want to continue to say.  People who say this often continue by saying  1st Gen are the only Pokémon they've cared about.  Every gen has great ones and some stinkers. Well, this game is set for you to catch them ALL.<br /><br />Whether you played the originals or not, there's enough familiar content and new content and improvements that this game, like Heart Gold and Soul Silver gets to stand out on it's own as a major contender for best Pokémon game ever.  It is just a sheer delight to play and Game Freak went above and beyond to give us another super great quality gaming experience.<br /><br />(I didn't mention online play because I don't do that until I've spent around 50 hours on the game. Writing this review I am only about 30 hours in)<br /><br />I hope you enjoy Pokémon Omega Ruby or Alpha Sapphire as much as I am",

A previous one I had was too narrow width-wise, so it couldn't seat. The design on this one seems pretty open, look at the pictures, you'll see the width is wide. So I had hopes this could be the one! My switch with the thin case sat on the dock with no issues at all. That's what I was hoping for based on the design. But I realized of a new issue. Even if you can seat your Switch with a case, it might not charge. The reason is because your case creates a rise that prevents the usb-c port and plug to fully connect. Logically, I knew about this already. But I anticipated that the contact would be enough for it to charge. Sadly, the answer is no. It needs to be 100% docked. The only solution is to modify the case, like cutting out a slot to allow it to fully seat with no rise. This isn't something I'm going to subtract a star for. The dock does it's job perfectly fine when I take my switch out of the case. But just a FYI to those who are trying to do what I'm doing. This is still a 5-Stars product!",

MyTeam took somewhat of  step back as you have to beat other users in 3v3 and 5v5 to unlock the auction and when I have tried those modes the other player has 90+ rated players and my best are mid to low 80's. What really sucks is that you have to use player contracts to play. In one of my 3v3 games they had a 95, 92 & 91 rated player and I had an 85, 81, and 80. So obviously I am going to lose that game and all 3 of my players lost a contract game as well. I liked the online modes last year where everyone just drafted cards but games were pretty evenly matched. This year I don't think I will ever unlock the auction because it isn't worth losing all those contracts hoping to get an even matched game. So unless they change to just play a 3v3 game and play a 5v5 game there are other teams light years ahead of mine, and I love to use the auction to get the players I want.<br /><br />Update...<br />Now the modes in MyTeam have been updated to where you just have to play a game of 3v3 and 5v5 instead if winning one.",

The graphics have the same quality and the load times between segments are similarly slow. In fact some of the segments seemed to take longer to load than to play.<br /><br />The weapons and opponents are largely similar to those you encountered in Quake 2 with a few, quite impressive, additions. There is a good variety of play environments ranging from outdoors and warehouse sized interiors, to claustrophobic mazes. Although Q4 doesn't suceed like Doom3 in making you jump out of your chair every few minutes, it's still pretty tense. Some of the cut scenes, especially the one where you get real ugly real fast, are exceptionally gross. Not for the weak-hearted.<br /><br />Probably my biggest gripe is that there aren't a whole lot of hidden goodies. Many times I found myself exploring under stairs or elevated platforms or investigating little nooks only to be disappointed that there was no reward at the end. When developers put so much effort in to building interesting and realistic environments they should give you more bonus stuff for exploring.<br /><br />I must say I wasn't a whole lot suprised to find out that this game runs on the same engine that Doom 3 uses. They really are very similar. Overall I would say this game is worth the $50 I paid for it, but it didn't blow me away like Doom 3 or Half Life II.",

            "question": "title: Great nose piece but headband needs work.\ntext: This X-super Home product for the Oculus Quest 2 comes with a headstrap and silicone face cover.  Both of these things are accessories that every Quest 2 must get and there are many options available to fit the bill.<br /><br />Out of the box, the Quest 2 comes with elastic straps that just aren't enough to hold the VR Goggles in place very well.  When turning your head, the goggle tends to swing around and feel like they will fall off.  Also, if you're one of the early adopters that purchased the Quest 2 before Facebook issued their recall where they will send you a silicone cover for the goggles, you're stuck with a cloth face cover that lets too much light through and gets pretty disgusting after just a short time using the goggle due to sweat.<br /><br />So the X-Super Home head strap features a battery holder at the back of the head, the theory being that the extra weight of the battery will help to counter balance the weight of the goggles, reducing neck strain while extending the play time of the goggles.  In practice, the battery makes the entire setup too heavy and reintroduces the problem of the goggles swinging around when turning your head.  In addition, there was a design error on the attachment bracket where the slot is shorter than the tab so the battery holder never fully slides into place.<br /><br />Due to the placement of the battery, the tightening knob is offset to the right of the battery.  This offset design creates a problem with the tightening system where one side would tighten more than the other, giving an unbalanced feel to the strap.<br /><br />The silicone cover, on the other hand, is quite excellent.  It has a texture on it that helps to keep a good grip around the eyes even when you sweat and the flaps over the bridge of the nose is larger than many others out there.  While not perfect, it greatly reducing the amount of light that leaks in.  Compare this to the silicone cover that Facebook sent as part of their recall, the Facebook cover is smooth and doesn't have a flap at all to cover the bridge of the nose.  The X-super Home cover is much better.<br /><br />So a less-than-ideal head strap and a great silicone cover.  Unfortunately, this doesn't justify the price of this product.",

I personally got rid of it after completion because I won't wait for or purchase &#34;add on&#34; garbage. because that's all it is.<br /><br />Back to this game.<br />Graphically 4/5 I think theres some parts they could've improved but overall it's rather good. the system runs a little rough here and there, but It hasn't effected or bothered my game play yet. The classes are fun to be part of although I immediately changed my classes after getting through the first part with one class.

The more you get into this game the stronger it will hold you. There's endless areas to explore, things to collect, and evil doers to slay.<br /><br />The menu system I think could've used a little bit of work as well, although i have grown more used to it. I get a bit mixed up gearing up all 4 of my characters at once trying to remember which one wears what can be stressful. however once you get past the rush style life we're used to and pay attention to what you have, one can carefully plan a magic defense, distance, or CQC defense depending on what area you're coming up on to attack.<br /><br />I did do this game as a download through xbox live i'm not sure if the disk is any different but something I do love is that I turn on my xbox, watch some netflix or something and when I go back to the game it's loaded where I left, no boot up or anything, simply constantly ready. It's rather nice. It's made doing whatever I want or need to do easy and seamless to switch back to my game.<br /><br />I've yet to get through the first map that i scouted a town at initially... i foresee many travels in my future.

I searched for \"silent mouse\" and followed a trail of products until I landed on this Logitech G502 HERO mouse. I don't know if it was advertised as quiet or silent, but it doesn't matter too much at this point. The mouse is very well crafted, and the weights that are provided allow you to customize how heavy the mouse is. I didn't think this would make a big difference, but it truly does. The weight keeps the mouse parallel to the desk surface but doesn't seem to inhibit movement at all. It's a fantastic feeling. Additionally, the mouse is wired, which eliminates having to worry about batteries or latency with a wireless connection.<br />I use this mouse for gaming and for everyday office use, but gamers who are more \"serious\" about their gaming will find all the bells and whistles needed. There are around 10 buttons on this mouse, and the software that is downloaded from the Logitech website makes setting up the functions very easy.<br />I believe this mouse was under $40 or $50 dollars when I bought it, and it is worth every penny in my opinion.<br />(By the way, it is not a quiet or silent mouse, but the clicks don't make much more noise than you'd expect of a high quality mouse.)",

This headset looked perfect for my needs - especially the 3.5 mm phone plug with 4 conductor bands, needed to pair with today's laptops and cell phones, which require that plug to get audio into and out of devices.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the audio quality was bad, with missing high and low frequencies.  I don't demand high-end audio quality for $24, but a headset must be better than this.  I returned this unit for a refund and bought a Koss SB/45 headset instead, which has very good audio sound quality for its $23 price, so much so that I could recommend that unit as a budget audio headphone, when you're not making phone calls!",

            "question": "title: Best Game Collector's Edition Ever\ntext: If you're here for an opinion on whether this is worth the money, well, obviously, only you can answer that question.  I will say that three years ago, I was completely blown away by the awesome Songbird collector's edition for Bioshock Infinite and Recore's CE even dwarfs that one.  This is not in any way a cheap product.  The creators clearly spared no expense, especially the magnificent centerpiece of a statue.  It's tall, wide, heavy, and intricately detailed. The box and heck, even the Styrofoam that holds the statue is done up right!  The lithograph envelope is embossed and the lithograph itself is on nice, thick stock with vibrant color.  Whether you prefer a metal disc case (very well done, inside and out) or a traditional X1 case to line up with your other games, you're covered.  One thing to be aware of with this collection, however, is that it is a physical copy ONLY of the game which means the Xbox/Windows 10 Play Anywhere will not work with it.  The game itself is fantastic for those who like old school action adventure platformers ala Jak and Daxter or the Metroid Prime series.  All in all, worth every penny in my book.",

It's an example of \"style\" over functionality.  The PS5 can not be set on it's side securely and has to stand up - limiting where you can place it.  Another serious design flaw is while it is standing up the vents are on the bottom of the PS5 and the vent holes are too small for adequate cooling of the CPU/GPU (APU since it is an AMD).  I am very disappointed in the Sony PS5, I would not recommend when you have Micro$oft X Box and Nintendo switch.  At this time (1/5/2021) due to the limited games, my family is still buying switch games, and trying to find used PS4 games to play on the PS5 - Why have a PS5 then?  Yes the graphics are great - but it has horrible cooling design flaws, personally I believe it is ugly, it can not be secured to sit on its side, and the game selection is bad.

Of course, she is too small to read the story herself but with the picture book game she loves to sit and listen.  My 8 year old loves to use the microphone (its included) to read the stories to her little sister.  You can turn the voice changer on or off while reading (some of the voices can be scary to sensitive children).  My 8 year old doesn't always follow the words and sometimes makes up her own (she thinks she's a comedian).  They only supply you with 16 stories or so some of which I haven't heard before.  The stories must be the original versions because the are very very sad and some are kind of graphic.  One, in particular, titled \"The Little Match Girl\" is especially sad (the child dies in the street).  Also, old favorites like \"Little Red Riding Hood\" has a hunter who promptly takes a scissors to cut Grandma and Red Riding Hood out of the wolf's stomach while he sleeps.  Obviously, it doesn't SHOW it but the hunter has a pair of scissors in his hand and afterwards they fill the wolf's stomach up with rocks while he his sleeping.  Like I said, it is probably the original version of the children stories which may be a bit to harsh for a sensitive child.

After only one day on this keyboard, I know I made the right choice in resuming my search. I have other mechanical keyboards (ALPS, Cherry MX Blue, even Buckling-spring with the original IBM 'clicky' keyboard purchased off eBay), but none are wireless. I gave up on wireless capability, thinking there was no such thing as a wireless mechanical keyboard.<br /><br />On cheaper mechanical keyboards, I encountered issues related to build quality. On mechanical keyboards within the same price range (and the IBM 'clickly' keyboard), noise was a factor. The issue was not related to disturbing anyone as I typed; noisy Cherry MX Blue or Buckling-spring keyboards inevitably become a distraction (for me) when I have to concentrate (while typing).<br /><br />There is a huge difference between this keyboard and membrane/pressure pad and chiclet keyboards - but anyone who has used a mechanical keyboard would know this right away. There is also a discernible difference between this keyboard and the other (wired) mechanical keyboards that I already own. Perhaps it's because this is the first, and so far only, keyboard I have used with Cherry MX Brown keys. The keys are tactile but do not require heavy pressure. And, this the only mechanical keyboard (that I am aware of) that is wireless.<br /><br />My typing is more accurate and much faster (95wpm versus approximately 65wpm on typingtest dot com). This keyboard allows me to concentrate on work rather than be hampered by the tedium of typing. It makes typing almost effortless, and dare I say, even enjoyable. The biggest compliment I can pay to this keyboard is to buy at least two more - one to use at home and one as backup.",

            "question": "title: Large capacity, sturdy, but poor design\ntext: This organizer sound good in theory, but it's really not very practical. I got excited that it holds 80 games, but when I started putting my games in the sleeves, I quickly realized that it's not easy. It requires 2 hands to put a game into a sleeve. If you look at picture 1, you can see that the sleeve doesn't open easily by pushing the game into it. You need to use 1 hand to pull the sleeve open and your other hand to push the game into the sleeve. I found this to be very inconvenient, especially if you're going to fill it with 80 games.<br /><br />My other big issue with the organizer is that the sleeves hide the labels of the games. I'm not removing any stars because of this because it's something I should have realized before I ordered it. If you look at picture 2, you can see that you can barely see any of the game titles, and even then, they aren't readable. The product images also demonstrate this, but it doesn't look quite as severe. Since you only see the red Switch label sticking out, it's difficult to organize your games alphabetically and difficult to retrieve them without pulling the game out to see if you got the right one.<br /><br />I didn't use the tempered glass because I don't have the OLED model. I mainly ordered this for the game organizer case.<br /><br />TLDR;<br /><br />Overall, great value, but it's not convenient to use. If you really don't mind the inconveniences, then this is a great purchase.<br /><br />Pros<br />  - Sturdy<br />  - Holds tons of games<br />  - Good value<br />Cons<br />  - Sleeves hide game labels<br />  - Difficult to get the games into the sleeves",

Seriously?<br />Maybe it's just the version I got, but this game is far too flawed to enjoy on any kind of consistent basis. Commands are not detailed in the manual or on the tutorial (for example, how to QUIT). There is no ingame help system, either. There is no explanation for important concepts like question marks over buildings in the tutorial.. the manual just says to look at them, decide what to do, and handle it. Overall, the tutorial was almost useless as a way of learning the game. Each segment of it appeared to last about 2 minutes and provide about 10 text lines of material, most of it encouragement. The manual, incidentally, can only be retrieved from the CD using Explore -- the CD auto-runs any other way you try to access it. It sure has a lot of pretty pictures, but it doesn't tell you how to quit either, or how to get tools, the shortage of which I tended to knock up against on a regular basis.<br />Graphics are blocky, but survivable. There is no explanation of what stars mean in the initial game setup -- I thought it was a rating system, but turns out it's probably a difficulty level. I still have no idea why I couldn't build a warehouse on the scenario I tried -- I had enough stuff, but it just didn't want to do it.<br />I suppose if I were more intuitive or more patient I could probably figure it out, but as it is, it's just too frustrating to play.",

The storytelling in WoW has never been better than it is in this game.  What's even better is that Blizz has been adding large content patches at a very nice and regular rate to ensure there's more to do.  While some people are complaining about time-locking some content (portions of certain end-game questlines unlock each week rather than being available all at once), I'm totally okay with it because it keeps me coming back and feels more like there's something to do rather than blasting through all content and being bored.",

This is the only Super Smash Bros. game I have ever played, so if you are reading my review in hopes of a comparison to the older games, you might want to skip this review and go to another.<br /><br />When I first picked up this game I wasn't sure I'd get into it. I knew it was a popular game that everyone was raving about, but after watching youtubes and trailers I just wasn't sure. However, I figured I'd give it a chance. Afterall, I've been a Nintendo fan ever since the NES games. I've played many Mario games in the past, just never Super Smash Bros. There's a first time for everything, right?<br /><br />So after popping this baby in and picking up the controller, nostalgia hit me when I saw some classic stages and old characters from the NES/Sega Genesis days of my childhood. I also enjoyed the many characters there were to choose from, and the fact that more could be unlocked. They even added R.O.B. the Robot and the Dog from NES Duck Hunt (If you were like me, you wanted to shoot that dog for always laughing at you back in the day. Now you can get your revenge on him -once he's unlocked of course).<br /><br />As for the gameplay, I had to teach myself a little bit by looking up the controls on  how to do each move. I'm still a bit on the sloppy side since I'm brand new to all of this, but that's part of the learning experience. You could also just smash buttons like a crazy person (great for children if you have any lol) and still hit your opponents that way, but I prefer to learn the right moves. It's more fun that way for me to have total control over my character.<br /><br />Oh, and I'd also like to add that I love all the controller options! You can choose between the Wii U Gamepad, 3DS (That's right, if you have one you can use it as a controller for this game!), Classic Controller, Wii Remote, Wii Remote plus Nunchuck, Gamecube controller (either the adapter or the one that plugs into the Wii Remote) ... You have so many options to choose from. I personally prefer the gamecube or the classic controller, but it's entirely up to you and your tastes! My husband prefers his 3DS as a controller (Btw, unlike myself, he's been playing Super Smash Bros. ever since the very first one came out back in the day and he LOVES this game).<br /><br />Overall, this is a great game that the entire family can enjoy playing together.

We run it off a 7.1 surround system, and I've had moments where a twig will snap behind me, or a beast will roar off to the left.  It is a bit more precise that I'm used to in how it handles locating sound between speakers, by firing both off but not at the same volume.  I really love that.<br /><br />The controller is so comfortable.  I had some problems early on with the rubber coming off, but each time Sony was great about quickly replacing the controller.  The audio jack on the controller means even the most basic headset can be effectively wireless for gaming.  I did not think I would like the touchpad, but now I love it.  It has an accelerometer, so for Infamous: Second Son, when you are using the controller like a can of spray paint, you have to turn it sideways and shake it.  And the embedded speakers are such, it sounds like a can of spray paint being shaken.  The PS3 controller always bothered me a little that it is too easy to inadvertently push down the left thumbpad (so it thinks you hit L3) when you are trying to run around.  I've yet to encounter that problem with this one, not even doing the various rundown sections of Assassin's Creed: Black Flag.<br /><br />Sharing in-game video is quick and easy.  It works so well, and so fast.  I didn't think I would use that, but it turns out I kind of like sharing awesome moments on Facebook.  I'm very much a solo gamer, and the library for that is still very impressive.<br /><br />If you have PlayStation Plus, your games are backed up online.  When I upgraded the hard drive, which is ridiculously simple, I just redownloaded my games, already in progress.  It picked up where it left out without a hitch.<br /><br />For stability, for elegance, for performance, and most importantly, for incredible game play, I give the PS4 five stars.",

It's got weird stylized lettering on the keycaps, the sides of the keyboard glow, and of course there's the animated crazy lighting effects of the keys themselves. The lighting effects are described in a small two-page &#34;manual&#34;, sort-of; the effects are named poetically, I guess you'd say; &#34;the dragon and the tiger spread their wings&#34; is one effect for example. Or maybe more than one; it's hard to say. It's fun to fool with it, for a while at least, though for me the only really useful modes are with the keyboard set up with plain boring continuous backlight.<br /><br />Now, all that said, once I got used to the keyboard after having used a Deck for years and years, I *really* like typing on it. The keys are clicky and they definitely make noise, but they feel great. The keyboard casing is quite solid, with the aluminum top curving around in front, translucent plastic on the left and right sides and in the back, and black plastic underneath. The keyboard barely flexes if I try a &#34;twist test&#34; from the sides (not that that's representative of actual use). Mainly I'm just really enjoying the keyboard for ordinary boring work use; I'm not a gamer. Great value for the money.",

            "question": "title: Honestly one of the most entertaining games I have ever played\ntext: Borderlands 2 is not a complicated game.  It's a first person shooter (FPS) which is focused on all-out shooting and looting.  And more shooting.  And more looting.  And then some more.<br /><br />What makes the game so entertaining, then?<br /><br />There are a few key areas.  The first is the setting and the characters, both of which are steeped in humor and pure entertainment value.  The graphical \"style\" of Borderlands 2 contributes to this -- it follows from the original Borderlands in following an animated comic book style of graphics, but upgrades this significantly with lighting and colors beyond what we saw in the original.  This graphical style is supremely appropriate for the kind of setting and characters, and humor, that the game contains, because the game is not aiming for a \"realistic\" feel, but rather a more contrived, less serious, more funny, and ultimately more entertaining one.  And this works to beat the band.  It keeps the game light-hearted and fun, which makes it a great game to play after work in the evening as compared with a more \"serious\" game.<br /><br />Another core area that makes the game great is the loot/leveling model.  Although the game doesn't feature the same loot explosion/loot pinata effect of the original, nevertheless loot keeps flowing, and one of the core enjoyments of the game is comparing and optimizing your loadouts.  And many of the weapons are just very, very entertaining to use.  In addition, each class has a signature power which can be built upon and upgraded and which defines playstyles that are markedly different for each class despite the fact that the game is essentially a shoot and loot game.<br /><br />The game is, in many ways, a hybrid of the loot system of an \"action RPG\" like Diablo or Torchlight, on the one hand, and a first person shooter, on the other, with a lot of humor thrown into the mix.  It makes for a very entertaining game to unwind with, and ultimately an enjoyable and relaxing gaming experience.  Frankly, this game is just pure fun to pick up and play, even if you are not generally a shooter fan.  Highly recommended.",

            "question": "title: 4.5 stars - great game\ntext: This game is awesome.  It would get 5 stars except for a couple negative things:  First of all, I would think someone from Remington would review the weapons being used in the game since a lot of the weapons are manufactured by Remington.  For example, most shotguns can only hold 3 rounds unless there's a magazine extension attached.  I've earned a shotgun that holds 12 rounds!  Great fun, but not realistic.  Yes, I know this is a shoot 'em up hunting game, and sometimes they do have to bend the rules a little to make it more playable.  I personally own an 870 SuperMag Turkey gun, and even with the mag extension, in real life, it only holds 6 + 1 in the barrel.  Ok, I know I'm nit-picking, but get it right, would ya?  The game creators did such a great job on this game that I would think they shoulda got the guns right.  Another gripe I have is the high-powered rifles that shoot the powerful 30 caliber rounds don't take down the game as well as the shotgun or bows do.  The bow is actually one of the best overall weapons you can use for big game, and the shotgun is great for small game and birds.  The bow usually takes down big game with one shot.  The shotguns are probably the best all-around weapons.  It's kinda cheesy, in my opinion, to use the shotgun to kill everything.  You can really rack up some combos with the shotgun, tho, because you are actually hitting the targets but not killing them with one shot.  Another thing I don't like is switching from weapon to weapon.  It would be nice if you could just pick a couple weapons like the bow, the shotgun, and one rifle, and have just 3.  Just like Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2011, you switch weapons with the joystick on the nunchuck.  It's not too bad, but you actually have 5 weapons to choose from when you earn them, and in a pressure situtation, you can over-manipulate the joystick and pick the wrong weapon.  You have a bolt-action rifle, a semi-automatic rifle, a shotgun, a handgun, and a bow.  So far, I've determined the semi-automatic rifles and handguns are almost worthless in the game.  Starting out, your bolt-action rifle and bow are your best friends.  I'm using a 40\" flatscreen TV, and it's still difficult to determine which rifle is which sometimes.  I actually look at the magazine capacity to tell which one is which most of the time.  That's another thing--I personally own a Remington 760 Gamemaster, and it does not hold 20+ rounds!  It holds 4+1 in the chamber in real life!  Anyway, I'm using my TopShot Elite rifle for this game.  I personally think it's the best option.  The Z button is the trigger, and the C button is the reload button.  A player shoots so much, it's nice to have the softer buttons.  It's also nice to have them located together.  I tried this game with my Wii Zapper, my CTA Sureshot rifle, and the TopShot, and like I said, the TopShot was and is definitely the best option for me.  High scores demand accuracy for this game (a lot like Grand Slam North America), so it's nice to use a rifle-type controller with a stock for stability's sake.  You don't ever want to miss to make it thru some of the levels.  I have made it through the first 18 levels in about 6 hours, and several of them are extremely challenging.  I think I have 3 more levels to go, and Level 19 is almost impossible!  I think the idea of the game is to get at least a bronze medal on each level, and then go back and get a gold medal on each level after you've unlocked the best weapons.  Ok, all that having been said, the game is extremely challenging, but also extremely fun.  There are so many critters to shoot that it's darn near impossible to get them all.  The sound effects and graphics are tremendous.  The music is also very good.  I know I concentrated a lot on nit-picking the negatives, but play this game for yourself, and you will see how good it is.  I put it in the same class as Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2011 and Top Shot Arcade.  Overall, a very excellent game--well worth the money.",

Have tried most of the other charging options and with the new Elite controller the old ones no longer work.  Their are some nice charging systems out there I will probably try out, but for now this works with all controllers for Xbox One and is Li-Ion. So for my Elite controller this is the best solution.  It is Microsofts fault that their elite controller will not work with the other charging systems because the used a different battery cover.  I have tried the other charger and battery options before my elite and they all took up too much space and usually had cheap batteries.  So I will stick with these until I see something new that has the same quality battery.",

            "question": "title: Extremely disappointing.  I bought it for the multiplayer, but doubt my friends any I will be playing it for very long.\ntext: Highly disappointing so far. Very bad matchmaking, no locale only option, party chat isn't allowed in any group game type other than Ground War, group members dropped joining games can't tell you because you're in game chat, and there's no option to leave games as a party, forcing everyone to quit out separately. I sincerely hope a patch comes soon, but there are a lot of things that would need to be fixed to make this enjoyable.<br /><br />I bought COD4 weeks after it had come out, so it could have had buggy matchmaking at it's release as well, but none of the eight people (friends and friends of friends) I just played with had seen issues like this with COD4 or COD:WaW. The matchmaking isn't necessarily fast, you can wait for a while before the game finally tries to match you with other people, but regardless of whether it was fast or slow, we were losing party members more than half the time. That is unacceptably bad. As the party leader, I've got an open NAT on a fixed IP that I pay an additional monthly fee for used only by my Xbox 360, on a connection with 3ms ping, 94.63 Mb/s upload and 65.67 Mb/s download. ([...])<br /><br />I fail to understand how, with that connection, people who connect to me with no problems, who play COD 4 and COD:WaW with me with no problems, don't even have a 50/50 chance of joining a game with me successfully.<br /><br />When we did lose people, they had no way of telling us, we had to figure out who was and who wasn't there. If Modern Warfare 2 would allow Party Chat, they'd be able to say, \"Hey guys, I got booted.\" But virtually every game mode requires you to leave party chat to play. Even game modes where you can speak the entire time. Yes, you do have the option to mute people rather quickly, and my friends who played for several hours today muted hundreds of people today...but even then, if you want to talk with your friends about work, life and the game while playing, you have no idea who could be listening in to your conversation. If this is supposed to make us talk to people, it's just going to result in groups of people talking over each other, as I expect quite a lot of people will keep chattering away, but will have either muted everyone who's not their friend or set their Xbox settings so they can only hear people on their friends list. (The Xbox 360 party chat function had meant that that wasn't necessary...but if I do keep playing this game, I may have to set my account chat setting to friend list only...which I'd rather not do.)<br /><br />When we did finally get into a game, over half the games we entered were yellow connections or worse, and the majority of those were quit out of because the connection was so bad it was unplayable. The same problem plagued Call of Duty 4 but wasn't nearly this bad. Treyarch was able to add a \"Local\" and \"Locale Only\" search option to Call of Duty: World at War, which allowed my friends and I to wait for a good game. If it took 15 minutes to get a game going, it was better than spending 30 minutes jumping out of unplayable games that we were repeatedly thrown into, losing friends on the way, and constantly having to reinvite people to the party but being unable to talk with them half the time due to the lack of Party Chat. (Party chat allows you to talk during loading screens and when people are booted or trying to join.) Infinity Ward failed to recognize how beneficial the \"Locale Only\" search option was, which was a key reason World at War was my group of friends' game of choice over the last year. After a full year of caring about each win (2,747), and loss (645), in World at War, I'm already of the mentality that I don't care about taking a loss in Modern Warfare 2, because the number of unplayable connections and friends lost when joining games is going to mean that dropping out of games is going to become a regular occurrence again. Win/loss stats mean nothing again.<br /><br />Treyarch's World at War was also smart enough to include a \"Leave with party\" option that meant the party leader could pull everyone out of a game together. If someone was getting a drink or using the restroom, the party leader didn't need to wait for them to return to change game types. In MW2, everyone needs to quit out individually, and again, without Party Chat, people sometimes get lost.<br /><br />Yes, Spec Ops is enjoyable, and I'm sure the Single Player campaign is enjoyable...but I bought this game for the single player, and the sheer volume of frustrating moments far outweighs the few really enjoyable games that were had. Even if the matchmaking is fixed, I don't see myself jumping in night after night to play Ground War over and over, and the lack of Party Chat is a huge strike against the enjoyability of this game.<br /><br />I'm sure all my friends will pick this up, and I'm sure we'll play it for weeks...but unlike the +10 days of game time that we put into COD4 or the +15 days that we put into COD:WaW, I don't expect to be coming back to the multiplayer unless some major changes are made to fix the matchmaking and allow Party Chat. (I understand the lack of party chat in S&D...I fail to understand the reason for excluding it from other game types.)<br /><br />As for the harsh grade, I would have gladly paid $60 for an updated version of COD4 or COD:WaW with new maps, weapons and other extras. I don't need a single player campaign or Spec Ops or anything else. I just needed an enjoyable multiplayer that my friends and I could play while we talked and had fun. The game does a very poor job of providing that. The underlying game looks like it could be great, but the hoops needed to jump through to get into one of those games with friends you can talk to is shocking.<br /><br />------  UPDATED  ------<br /><br />I posted this review to the IW forums a few days ago, and I received the reply: \"...these problems with matchmaking will sort themselves out eventually with our constructive feedback to IW.\"<br /><br />I hope so. That reply made me think that my review could have been more constructive, and on the off chance that anyone from IW would read it, I made a list of constructive criticism that could help them. I thought that list might be worth adding here, as it clearly points out some of the things this game is lacking, possibly better than my original review did.<br /><br />Please note that the list below is strictly focused on matchmaking, UI and the ability to play this game with your friends.  None of the suggestions would impact the gameplay itself.<br /><br />Here are the things I think urgently need to be addressed, as they're easy to fix but complete game breakers for many:<br /><br />1. Party Chat: Put party chat back in for everything but S&D. Put in an MLG game room or whatever alternative rooms you want for angry young racists with a mic that don't want anyone using Party Chat, and let them yell at each other in there. Those of us who view online games as a social outlet to play with friends want this...BADLY. Even Penny-Arcade is wondering why this decision was made. If it was to keep us from talking after we die...why can we still talk after we're dead in game chat in every game type I've played so far? (I have not played S&D yet) Is it technologically impossible to prevent people in Party Chat from playing on the other team? I would love it if Party Chat guaranteed that people in your party would be on your team.<br /><br />2. Match Making - Lost Team Members: I'm still repeatedly losing party members when trying to get games going. Is this really that difficult to fix? I can understand there are bugs that need to be worked out, but thanks to the lack of Party Chat, there's no way for dropped people to let their team know they've been dropped. A message like, \"Party Members were unable to join the game, would you like to back out and get them or continue the game without them?\" would be helpful. Baring that, making your squad members easy to visually differentiate (possibly a blue background or text for everyone in the party) which would make it possible to quickly confirm all X number of party members made it. Also, just enabling Party Chat would make it easier to communicate in cases where some people don't make it.<br /><br />3. Match Making - Bad Connections: I'm still regularly being thrown into games where we have unplayable connections (people in our squad will be all red and yellow connections, even when there's six of us geographically within 20 km of each other jumping into a 6-on-6 game). A \"Locale Only\" option would be very welcome. I'm happy to sit around for minutes waiting for a playable game. I doubt a patch will come soon enough to make me care about my W/L stats...so I will continue jumping out of games with bad connections...but again, I'm more than willing to wait for a game where everyone on both teams has a reasonable playable connection. Net code improvements? Server upgrades? You guys can do whatever you want there...but until I see a \"Locale Only\" or \"Maximum acceptable ping\" or similar option, I'll be of the assumption that you really don't care about my interest in a playable connection, and my team will keep jumping out of matches with bad connections, which is a less than ideal solution when it isn't an issue in other games...<br /><br />The following are improvements that seem obvious to me, most of which are probably seen in the majority of online games:<br /><br />1. Leave with Party: This one is obvious. If a group of friends playing together wants to change games types, the party leader should have the option to leave with group. The group can enter games together...why can't they leave games together? COD:WaW did this, so it can't be hard to implement. Everyone dropping in and out separately is annoying enough when you are able to use Party Chat. It's horrible without Party Chat.<br /><br />2. Add to Squad: There were squads in COD that meant we didn't all have to jump out every time a friend jumped on. They could join the game and if they were on our team, they could join our squad and stay on our team without everyone having to drop out and try to jump back into a game again. Again, this was in COD:WaW, so it can't be that hard to implement and it keeps people playing instead of having them search for games...(with the currently inevitable booting of people randomly and joining games with unplayable connections.)<br /><br />3. \"Invite\" option: Why would I want to invite people from the game menu and then play against them? The only benefit I can see for this is people who spam invite people they've played against and beaten... If I use the invite option to invite a friend, I want to play with them. Why not have invites sent this way automatically add them to your squad when they accept? I don't want random spam invites to play against people I don't know, and I was excited at the possibility that we could just invite friends to our team without quitting out of the game.<br /><br />4. X to skip: I'm not big on skipping levels, and I haven't played enough to dislike any levels enough to skip, so I didn't notice this at first, but why make skipping more difficult than it needs to be? Neither this or the items the follow below are nearly as important as the first six points in my mind.<br /><br />5. Volume control: Another option I used in World at War that disappeared is the ability to adjust individual volume sliders for the game sound effects, music, and other noises. I have A40 headphones now, so it's no longer an issue for me personally, but if someone's trying to keep the volume at a reasonable level, let them lower the BGM slider and other non game sounds while keeping the SFX (the important game sounds) at the highest setting. When I did adjust these settings, I never felt it gave me any sort of advantage in hearing people in the game, it just lowered the pre and post game music enough to placate my wife.<br /><br />Lastly, improvements that I'd like to see when getting into games with friends and having fun is taken care of:<br /><br />1. Barracks Leaderboards: Where did the breakdown by game type go? I could care less about K/D in any game type other than Deathmatch, as that's the only time it's the main point. Even in Free-For-All, killing 25 people and dying 20 times is better than killing 15 people and not dying if you're playing in the spirit of the game...so why create leaderboards that encourage people to focus on kills in game types that focus on objectives? (In the last COD game, I'm 2.27 k/d in TDM and 1.5 in Headquarters, but I believe I have a better win rate in HQ because I play the game...) The new stat system leaves a lot to be desired. It would be great to see a lot of information available, and I understand this may be coming in the future.<br /><br />2. Lobby Leaderboard: Something to look at between matches when you aren't adjusting classes, and wondering who exactly you're playing with and against.<br /><br />3. Online Leaderboards: Again these are all things that can be added in the future, and would add to the fun, but aren't as important as the points above: Online stats, iPhone app, Web based challenges you can complete in game, being able to compare accolades with friends, being able to compare individual gun stats with friends, stats by game type, trending stats (k/d average for each hour of a given game type, etc.), etc, etc, etc. There's plenty of data people would love to gobble up, and stats added to my enjoyment of Halo 3 and Call of Duty: World at War. But really, it's secondary to all the multiplayer issues I listed above, and I'd be very happy if IW took those points into consideration and made changes to improve the multiplayer experience for everyone.<br /><br />Honestly speaking, if all the improvements above were made, my rating for multiplayer would probably be either 4 or 5 stars, depending on how multiplayer holds up over time...but even if there's a great game under all the BS, the BS is currently getting in the way.<br /><br />As for single player, it's too short, the airport level killed the game for me, and the levels felt uninspired compared to COD4. (Rent, don't buy, if you're only interested in single player)  Spec Ops is very enjoyable if you a friend to play it with, but it certainly wouldn't have a big impact on whether or not I recommend the game to someone.<br /><br />As far as how \"fun\" this game is...I still feel two stars is the best rating with the current problems it has, and I will update this if IW ever addresses them.",

            "question": "title: Nearly flawless, but flawless for RPGs.\ntext: The Hori Digital Controller for the GameCube is one of my “grail” controllers. For over a decade I've casually eyed this controller, seeing its price rise from high double digits to what it is now. Still, I don't think the price is that bad for such a unique controller. I love it when companies take their own, fresh perspective on standard controller layouts without making them unwieldy. Comfort is usually the driving force for change, as well as quality-of-life improvements. 8BitDo has been doing a fantastic job in this regard, and now Retro Fighters isn't far behind.<br /><br />Retro Fighters (“RF”) is doing wonderful things in the controller world. My first controller was the Brawler64 when it came out in different colors. (While I was aware of the Kickstarter, I avoided it out of personal reasons with Kickstarter itself.) It was love at first touch. It perfectly conformed to my hand and felt wonderful. The d-pad could use some refinement, but overall it's great. Fast-forwarding through a bunch of controllers, we arrive at the BladeGC. I knew I had to have it. Initially, I thought 8BitDo would release a controller like this, or at least some other company, so I was super excited when Retro Fighters announced it. Though I'd still like to get the Hori one some day, it's no longer a must; it's wired and doesn't have features for modern systems. Let's list the upgrades:<br />- grip<br />- analog sticks<br />- two more shoulder buttons<br />- vibration<br />- Switch/PC buttons<br />- wireless (and 2.4 GHz to boot!), with both a dongle for the GameCube and one for USB<br /><br />Already this is the perfect upgrade to the Hori Digital Controller. The little Z button is missing on the front, but of course it's not a requirement.<br /><br />I'll start with commenting on the d-pad. It's…phenomenal. I'm *very* picky about d-pads. Nintendo's of course are best, with Hori a close second. 8BitDo's may feel nice, but they have a habit of mis-presses. This can be remedied by opening the controller and applying binder reinforcement tabs; not ideal, but definitely alleviates the issue. But this d-pad? Damn… My thumb *skates* across it. When I first opened it, I was a bit disappointed with how it felt. It's low and has straight corners. But during play is when I noticed how marvelous it is. I tried Crash Team Racing, Stardew Valley, and Shredder's Revenge. Every input was precise and correct, and my thumb was able to just skate across it with speed and accuracy. Mein Gott.<br /><br />I haven't extensively used the analog sticks since I didn't get this controller for them, but I tested them with Smash. There's an octagonal gate for each stick, and each movement was comfortable and, for the time I spent using them, precise as well. They're smooth but don't let your thumbs slide off. The tops are flat, with the outer ring (textured for gripping pleasure) jutting up just enough to prevent thumbs from steering off. They don't have as wide an area to move as the GameCube controller, or maybe that's because they're not as tall, but they work well enough. Because of how wonderful this controller feels, I now plan to get the BattlerGC.<br /><br />The vibration is subtle. I'm unsure whether there's an option to change the strength, but the manual doesn't indicate that so I don't think so. It's not too low so as not to feel it; in fact, I think it's the perfect strength if you prefer a little feedback without it dominating the hands. I've had some third-party controllers that freakin' rattled the whole controller. Super uncomfortable. The BladeGC's gives you just a small jolt to remind you that you got hit, loser.<br /><br />And the wireless connectivity? A non-issue. Since this is not Bluetooth, it can't be used with the Switch when in handheld mode; instead, the USB dongle plugs directly to the dock. The Switch then reads it as a wired controller (which must be turned on in settings) and away you go. There is no discernible lag from what I noticed.<br /><br />Now on to the “bad.”<br /><br />Material. The controller is already light enough, but the quality of the plastic is very light and feels hollow. There is no grip texture. Rather, the whole thing is smooth and my hands can slide a bit easily. This is something I noticed with other RF controllers, so I know it isn't just this. Based on how it feels, it doesn't feel like a premium controller, though I certainly consider it one.<br /><br />Stick placement. There is little distance between the right stick and the B button. I have relatively small hands (5'8\", so whatever size hand that coordinates to) and haven't moved the stick accidentally, but I always feel it when pressing the B button. This made me wonder how people with bigger thumbs will experience the controller.<br /><br />But that's it. No more bad. Everything good. Oh, maybe the back shoulder buttons. I prefer ones that stop with a noticeable press, but these go just straight down like a lot of modern shoulder buttons. Gross. Maybe the sticks can be bigger too, but I'll wait until I try the BattlerGC to comment on that.<br /><br />This will be my main controller for RPGs, or any other game that utilizes the d-pad and A button a lot.<br /><br />B for materials and stick placement, A+ for everything else.",

            "question": "title: Better than Civ V, but no Master of Magic\ntext: I remember the original Civilization.  it's spawned many copies and variants since then, one of those being Master of Magic, which kept the basic theme of Civ, but added in races and magic to the mix.  It also gave us the first appearance of heros.<br /><br />Many of hte original writeups about Elemental suggested that it was going to be the sequel to Master of Magic.  I looked forward to getting it, as I love this type of game, and trying to run the odl Dos Master of Magic on my computer doesn't work all that well.<br /><br />Sadly, when Elemental first came out it did have major bugs taht left the game nearly unplayable.  Fortunately Stardock didn't quit on the game and they have made numerous refinements and improvements.  I have no had a crash in months, and the game appears stable.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it still is no Master of Magic.  The races are divided effectively into a light and dark side and the dark \"Empire\" races have a huge initial advantage due to their tech tree.  They don't get some of hte top Techs that the light \"Kingdom\" races can obtain if they have enough time, but they do have a huge early advantage.<br /><br />It doesn't help taht the AI isn't very good especially at dealing with a well organized \"stack of death\".  If you have time to put together a powerful stack of 8-9 high level units, you can easily crush anything the computer sends against you.  Tactics tend to be simple.  Keep one stack together and build it up to a high level doing quests and killing the wandering monsters until its powerful enough to kill anything it faces.<br /><br />The game is in my mind better than Civ V.  It doesn't have the city states, but it offers more choices in the city management and tech choices.<br /><br />A good game, but not a great one.  I hate that I paid full price considering what I know now, but its not a horrible deal either.",

I immediately jumped into the game and enjoyed the unfamiliar narrative and game perspective.  The cinematic scenes are wonderful and lead the story along well.<br />If you have never played a Metal Gear game, throw the following games in a blender, add ice, and enjoy:<br />1) Just Cause 2<br />2) Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell<br />3) Farmville<br /><br />The reasoning?<br />1 - The game has quite a bit of open world, wander around and have fun, but with objectives still tied.<br />2 - While you can be deadly and run-and-gun in this game (the path I'm taking more of), this game rewards you for being stealthy.  You will spend half of your time planning and the half executing your plan.<br />3 - The game provides you a base to help in research new items and maintain a constant flow of materials and money to further your progress.  While there isn't much of a grind to the game, I do find that I have to watch my funds and make decisions on what I want to progress on next.<br /><br />Two cons for the PC version - no multiplayer as of yet.  If multiplayer does matter to you, then I would recommend holding off until Konami announces that their multiplayer servers are stable.  Second issue controlling your horse when using a keyboard and mouse.  The riding experience is subpar as the controls for riding are not adjusted for WASD so your horse will not make good angular adjustments until you move your mouse in that specific direction.  This is fine when running away, but makes life difficult when attempting to fire a weapon while riding.<br /><br />Based on just the single player experience, MGS V:TPP is a worthy contender for Game of the Year (GOTY).",

First, I have two original, authentic controllers (I’m the original owner of a nearly never used Wii lol). They fit perfectly. I also bought 2 generic controllers. Those also fit perfectly.

This is great for little kids because of that. Very intuitive. It’s pretty cool.<br /><br />Without the controller inserted, it may not seem very sturdy, but once you put the controller in it, it’s perfect! Good weight and feels substantial.

            "question": "title: Surprisingly good with a silly flaw\ntext: The good news is that this controller is way better than a Wiimote in a plastic wheel.  It's honestly a great solution for driving games without the bulk, hassle, and cost of a full fledged wheel setup but better than the standard controller or the aforementioned Wiimote setup.  At first it was a tough transition from the standard controller at first, with oversteer being the biggest issue.  In time my times improved, mostly by avoiding the wild spells of oversteer turning into a complete loss of control.  As an added bonus, in Forza my corners used to score mostly 1s and 4s, where now I routinely get 2s and 3s (plus the 1s and 4s).  I'm guessing it's showing a greater deal of consistency, and I know passing and drifting is way easier.  Would a full wheel setup be better?  Definitely, but it would take way more room in my living room.  With this, I can throw it under the couch or whatnot.<br /><br />The bad news?  Well that's baffling.  I understand the lack of analog sticks, as the wheel replicates most of that, but the wheel has no should buttons.  That's a huge loss for driving/racing games, as these buttons often are used for shifting.  Hell, even Microsoft's own Forza series uses it extensively for setup.  I couldn't even change the setup (to reduce the oversteer I mentioned above), as you need shoulder buttons to tab over.  Frankly I cannot fathom why Microsoft didn't find some place to put the buttons.  Even a crappy location is better than nothing.  The light up ends are gimmicky, and I'd rather have should buttons.  Other than that, ergonomics aren't great.  It's not a huge deal, but, it could be quite a bit better.  Do know that this wheel isn't compatible with rechargeable battery packs, the charge and play kit, or and voice chat capability.  Frankly it really doesn't seem like a 1st party effort.  It does work beautifully wirelessly however.<br /><br />In the end, I really like the controller.  It didn't cost too much, and it's not another bulky peripheral.  If it had shoulder buttons, it would be a 5 star product.",

            "question": "title: Nice hardware, terrible software\ntext: This would be a 5 star product if the software wasn't so terrible.  iCue is slow, buggy, and crashes on a regular basis.  Sometimes the headset wakes up and works in seconds, other times it can drag out to 30+ seconds.  If you click on iCue in the system tray to open it, the software might eventually open.  Keyword: Might.  Eventually.  If it does open, moving from screen to screen takes longer than your Grandma would take to run a marathon.<br /><br />For some reason the percentage of battery life remaining is buried in the settings, and only occasionally shows when connected.  It doesn't show at all when charging so you have no idea how charged it is until you unplug it.<br /><br />The firmware of the headset is version 0.02.  Yes, ZERO POINT ZERO TWO.  Sometimes the voice prompts play when you hit buttons, sometimes you just get beeps.  If you press the mute mic button it mutes, but when you unmute it the sidetone shuts off so it sounds like your mic went dead when it didn't, until you either hit mute/unmute over and over or power the headset off and back on.<br /><br />Sometimes when fully charged the light on the headset turns green.  Sometimes it stays yellow for days, but when you unplug it from charging iCue shows it's at 100% charged but the software was just too buggy to make the light turn green consistently.<br /><br />The mic is too quiet.  Even maxed out it barely registers when you test it unless you have the mic so close to your lips it tickles.  The only way to make it a reasonable volume is to install a third party equalizer app named Equalizer APO and boost the Mic gain using it.  This means it's a software issue not a hardware one that Corsair hasn't bothered to fix despite threads on it being all over gaming forums.<br /><br />The only complaint I have about the physical hardware is the buttons for mic mute and power is hard to find by touch as they're smooth and have no ridges or anything else to identify them.  This is a 5 star piece of hardware hobbled by 1 star software.  Considering this product has been on the market since August 2017 there's no excuse other than Corsair being too cheap and lazy to fix the software.<br /><br />Go buy something made by a manufacturer who knows how to hire decent programmers, Corsair definitely can't.",

The gameplay is smooth, controls are nice, graphics are great, and even the commentary is decent in this game.<br /><br />Between fights you manually heal your cuts, which is cool. Your trainer will give you pep talks specific to your situation. Example: \"You really need to block that right eye, or the ref is going to stop the fight, that cut is awful.\"<br /><br />The controls are beautiful. There are 5 different configurations you can choose from.<br /><br />Career mode is alright. Rivalries are random, and there doesn't seem to be much importance put into championships and such. The rivalry thing is rather lame. Before you fight a rival it'll show you at the weigh in and your opponent always punches you and you have a little mini fight in first person view. Not my favorite, but again it's not bad enough to deduct from the rating of the game.<br /><br />Character customization is pretty cool. You can buy different pieces of gear including trunks, boots, mouthpiece, gloves, etc, all having attribute additions to your figther. Ex: Speed +20%.<br /><br />The only major drawback to this game is that it is extremely easy. Even on the hard difficulty, with a weight class or two lower than your opponent, you almost have to TRY to lose.<br /><br />I love this game, and I can't wait for round 4.<br /><br />PS.

You immediately become aware of just how much and how often your head moves.  This noise is horribly loud and annoying.  You can hear it even if the headset is not plugged into anything so this is a physical design issue.<br /><br />The headset seems to work all of 20-30 seconds when using Google Voice, which was the primary reason I got them.  Then it just simply cuts out speaker and microphone, EVERY SINGLE TIME!  Basically useless.<br /><br />It will however play music just fine.  I even tried playing music, then starting a call.  First it cut out the music, then the call, then a few seconds later the music cut back in.  That's reliability.<br /><br />So I decided to download their drivers rather than relying on Windows 8.1 drivers.  Their drivers made all sound on my laptop useless.  Gone is the smart switch from the headset to the laptop speakers when I unplug the headset or the other way around.  So is the builtin ability to have a default sound system for playing music and a default system for communications.<br /><br />Worst of all?  The drivers stop the ability to open Sound from Control Panel.  I rebooted, tried again, then went to uninstall their drivers/software.  Surprise, the Sound settings popped up on its own as soon as the it was uninstalled.  It was being held back by the software.  HORRIBLE programming.",

I do however actually enjoy the ability of playing this through a controller, they did successfully make that fun and worth its while. it was slightly clunky, but overall was a good experience for someone whose used to a mouse and key on this game.<br /><br />However, they let Microsoft manage the servers... .this made it both great and beyond useless at the same time.... I realize blizz can't do it all but the servers being monitored my MS left hacks and cheats easily entering the game and spreading like a virus. Where I don't mind this... is a almost nostalgia feeling of diablo 1 and some of diablo 2 where people had some hacked items, making the game a joke. however on the PC I enjoyed this aspect. I still replayed the game as there were still items i wanted to find and enjoyed being &#34;legit&#34;. Maphacks were always my favorite i wasn't always huge on the items being hacked up. every corner i turn in the counsel version there are paragon level who even knows how they made it that far's, and not a one of them understands the grind that really should have been needed to acquire such a level. It's not that i'm hating on these people, some of them are the regular old school diablo players just enjoying the new and slightly nostalgia experiences.<br /><br />if these servers were &#34;monitored&#34; by blizzard... kept at their standards. I would be more interest in continuous play on this game. I'm going back to enjoying my PC version. sadly hundreds of thousands of us have already bought this and made them all think it was a huge success. and for some people it is and it is fun... it's likely a lot of pc users will shelf this game before they get far however.",

It may be that this keyboard is made specifically for gamers and not meant to be used by anyone else. However, I have owned for some time another brand of gamer keyboard that I use regularly, and it doesn’t have the design flaw that this keyboard does.<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />1. It's appearance is attractive, especially the fact that it lights up in blue when plugged in.<br /><br />2. This keyboard comes with a mouse, and the mouse is also very attractive. It lights up in blue and red when plugged in.<br /><br />3. This keyboard is both full size and compact in design.<br /><br />4. The price is reasonable.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />1. A design flaw of the keyboard is a huge problem! I have been typing on a computer keyboard for 40 years. And on every keyboard I have ever used, the Enter key is one key to the right of the Single-Quote/Double-Quotes (“Quote”) key. When you want to press the Enter key, you simply lift up your right pinky finger and move it over one key. Inexplicably, this keyboard includes an extra key between the Quote key and the Enter key! I cannot state strongly enough how enormous a negative this is. There may be some reason for gamers to have a keyboard designed this way, but the keyboard is useless for everyone else. It is simply unusable to me. As a touch typist, the first time I used it, I reached my finger to hit the Enter key and was shocked when nothing happened. I wasn't looking at the keyboard, and for several additional, frustrated taps, I tried again and again to engage what I naturally assumed was the Enter key. Then I looked at the keyboard, and I couldn't believe my eyes. I was hitting an alien key between the Quote key and the Enter key.<br /><br />Why would anyone design a keyboard this way? If I tried to train myself to use this keyboard, I would quickly develop repetitive stress injury. It is much too far for my pinky to comfortably stretch to reach the Enter key.<br /><br />Again, this keyboard may be designed specifically by gamers for gamers. But if you are not a gamer and just are looking for a glow-in-the-dark keyboard for a reasonable price, I highly recommend that you look elsewhere.",

Play as either Lord Vader or Emperor Palpatine clearing out a rebel base... Oh yeah all this content is in the tutorial so you can learn the controls before you start a mission.<br /><br />The game lost 1 star for being Origin based only, Steam is the only platform I like... I've hated the Origin platform since my computer came with Battle Field 4 free and it was only redeemable via Origin. I prefer the Steam layout to view game library much better.<br /><br />UPDATE: The game has now lost a 2nd star from the review, at first I was like COOL check out these 8 solo missions I can play and get achievements on. ACTUALLY it is only 4 missions not 8, they just give you basic characters in 4, then your side gets a hero to destroy them on the other 4 missions, which made it go from a mission to a joke. I played as Hon Solo and absolutely destroyed the other team (AI of course, it's solo mission ...) honestly, the least fun I've ever had playing a Star Wars game, I own a couple they are listed in alphabetical order via Steam library STAR WARS: Battlefront II, Empire at War: Gold Pack, Dark Forces, Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II, Jedi Knight: Mysteries of the Sith, Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast, Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy (one of the BEST), Knights of the Old Republic, Knights of the old Republic II: The Sith Lords, Republic Commando, Starfighter, Star Wars The Clone Wars: Republic Heroes, The Force Unleashed Ultimate Sith Edition, The Force Unleashed II. Now I can't say I've played them all, because buying a bundle pack you get some of the old games that I used to play but look horrific this day and age. BUT all those games cost the same as this single Star Wars: Battlefront Standard Edition during a Steam bundle. I SHOULD HAVE WAITED FOR A SUPER $5 DEAL DAY, not this stupid $20 price tag.<br /><br />UPDATING THE UPDATED UPDATE TO THE MOST CURRENT UPDATE: The game has risen back to 4 stars, because the graphics are pretty darn awesome, the training is still my favorite, the star is added mainly because how First and Third person is able to be changed at the push of a button during game play... Now take into account they have some really cool scenery, almost as good as The Witcher 3 in some spots! Third person shooters generally aren't games I buy,so it's nice to have a choice!",

            "question": "title: Above average gaming headset\ntext: The corsair virtuoso is a pretty good headset. I previously used my Void Pro SE, and draw most of my comparisons off that. I broke down my thoughts into few categories.<br /><br />Fit: The headset feels stiff and a little tight on the sides of my head. I prefer the fit of the void pro. I think I have a pretty medium sized head, and I felt a fair amount of clamping pressure on my ears. This also makes the headset feel lighter because there was less weight resting on the top of my head. I wish this were more adjustable because it's a little too tight.<br /><br />Sound: (tested in wired & wireless mode, and experienced similar results): Just to clarify, I am no audiophile and have not owned a high quality set of headphone, but the sound seems ordinary. I tried to give this a big sample of uses: thx intro video, streamed music, I still have some .wav files, and gamed a bit. The headset handled all of it, but in much the same way as my void pro.<br /><br />Mic: This was my favorite part of the headset. My experience with detachable my microphones has been less than stellar. Most of the time they look incredibly flimsy and generic. This mic matches the rest of the asthetics of the headset, and has sounded better and crisper than any mic I've tried. The mic is flexible, but I wish you could change the color of the mic LED. It is solid green when unmuted, and red when muted.<br /><br />Design, look, feel: very nice corsair style. Perforated side RGB is cool, ear pads are a nice cushy leathery feel. It feels like all the surfaced are metal, padding, or coated plastic to make it nice to touch. With the mic removed they look like a nice set of headphones.<br /><br />Other thoughts: I had some pains with the setup of these. They did not auto sync with corsair's icue software, and had a lot of crackling when used just with plug n play. I had to manually update the software and plug the headphones into the usb via cable. This fixed the sound issues, but the headset will sometimes not show up next to my other corsair devices in icue. This is frustrating, and I did not have these problems with my Void Pro.<br /><br />I feel like these are very nice for a normal gaming headset, but it doesn't seem to be worth more than $200.<br /><br />Hope this has been helpful:)",

The setting for this time managment game is a new one- you're in charge of building a marina, and you get to select the beach on which you do so.  The new scenery is refreshing.  Each level contains a series of goals, and there are lots of levels, allowing for lots of gameplay.  Players also get to keep working on the same marina- so there's no repeated starting over from scratch.  But there are cons too, and most important among those, is the fact that this game gets very repetitive, very quickly.  Players do the same tasks over and over again.  While it's nice to keep improving the same project/beach, this also contributes to the overall repetitiveness.

            "question": "title: Excellent expansion for the Sims 3 franchise.\ntext: ** NOTE: This is an expansion pack (EP). You must have the Sims 3 base game in order to use this expansion pack. **<br /><br />EA's struck gold again with this expansion to its mega-popular Sims franchise. In this one, the theme is \"fun in the sun,\" with beach- and resort-themed play and objects to enjoy. With Maxis at the helm, what could go wrong? Indeed, this is just one solid hit after another, with gorgeously thematic objects and Create-a-Sim (CAS) stuff and added gameplay that reinforces the theme.<br /><br />EA's well aware that one of The Sims 2's strengths was the ability to own and run a business, and here, they give players the ability to develop and run a resort. Resorts are one of the most obvious new features to the game, and they're addictive to create. They can be themed a variety of ways, though the ones EA's favored are a traditional beach theme which is a bit Bohemian, \"Spanish,\" which looks like Southern California to me, and something modernistic. The blueprint system they introduced a while ago gets a major update here with a variety of new rooms including pools, which have been majorly updated too and aren't just pretty landscaping anymore; you can install pool bars, slides, and waterfalls as well as the old-school diving boards. Every day, guests visit the resort and rate it, and their activities and ratings influence how much money the resort owner gets. Resorts can be placed in any gameworld just like any other lot type. Along with resorts, players also now have the ability to have any number of home lots in a world--and can move between lots (as well as gameworlds) almost effortlessly.<br /><br />As to home lots, players can build as many homes or resorts in one town as they like, or chuck it all and just go live on a houseboat. Yep, houseboat. They're easy to build and handle, and their biggest strength is that they can sail--and dock--just about anywhere! I love houseboats.<br /><br />Beaches have also been updated. Now players can direct their Sims to \"play in the ocean\" or even play with toddlers in the ocean, holding their little hands so the tykes can safely kick and laugh in the water. Sims can lay out in the sun (they get their own bright-colored towels to lay on). Any age of Sim can now make sand castles. And with a lifeguard chair on the lot, a Sim can now be a lifeguard, one of the new professions.<br /><br />One of the other major updates to the game involves dive lots. A Sim can now go snorkeling or SCUBA diving and find treasure and meet mermaids. These underwater dive jaunts are so incredibly beautiful and evocative. I can't say enough how gorgeous these lots are. Some have treasure chests that can be opened like mummy sarcophagi in World Adventures; many have secret caves that can be explored (but watch out for the tentacled beasts!) as rabbitholes. And with careful planning, players can create their own dive lots.<br /><br />The expansion's town, Isla Paradiso, is incredibly thematic. Each rabbithole and house looks perfectly in place for a Caribbean sort of theme, with colorful yellows, blues, pinks, and oranges predominating. The plants and building supplies are colorful and gorgeously wrought. The pre-made Sims are also perfect--I liked the back stories and appreciated the diverse cast of characters. The islands are time-consuming to travel, but there are some new methods of transportation--windsurfing boards, swan boats, speedboats, or just water taxis if you're poor. Or your houseboat, of course. The island chain also features secret islands discovered via gameplay.<br /><br />I didn't see much here that was too sexually suggestive beyond the stuff that the Sims 3 already features; there are some new WooHoo locations, but as always, sexual activity is adult-only and carefully censored. There is obviously no cursing, and aside from the pool bars that serve juices of various kinds, no suggestion of alcohol or drugs that I've seen. Some of the new outfits for men and women alike get a little skimpy, which didn't bother me but might be of concern to others. If so, make sure to check out the online fansites' writeups about them before picking this up.<br /><br />The Limited Edition version of this game includes a bunch of \"stranded castaway\" objects and CAS stuff. I LOVED that stuff; it's well-made all the way around and definitely looks spot-on for what it is. Anybody wanting to build \"poverty\" lots or needs more ragged clothing for a werewolf will like this stuff. I recommend getting the LE if you can.<br /><br />Overall, I hugely recommend this expansion to anybody even vaguely interested in this particular theme.<br /><br />As noted, this is an expansion, so it requires the base game in order to be played. It doesn't require an internet connection or Sims 3 forum account to use. I use the disk on both my Mac and PC, and will mention that on the PC it runs like a charm, but on the Mac, I get a lot of memory errors due to my machine not being top-of-the-line anymore. It doesn't run at all if I use all of my expansion packs, stuff packs, and Store downloadable content, but with the game totally crippled (I use about 20% of my total TS3 purchases on the Mac), it runs fairly tolerably. I'd be very cautious about getting this expansion if your Mac is already throwing Error 12s or crashing-to-desktop and you don't want to uninstall oodles of stuff; as you might be able to tell from my description, this EP is very memory-intensive and will definitely wreak havoc on a delicate ecosystem. I'm reluctantly docking this EP a star because I just can't play it on my Mac without seriously gimping my Sims 3 build. I wish EA would make a more Mac-friendly experience with this franchise.",

They feel very nice and lightweight, 163grams. They are comfortable and have a cool, unique design. They have Bluetooth and Lightspeed wireless technology which is awesome. The headset charges via USBc and last a pretty good amount of time before needing a recharge. I don't play more than 4 hours in a single day and not every day, but I have gone almost a week before charging. The audio is good enough, not outstanding but good enough. The noise isolation really isn't there and I didn't really expect it to be a top performer. I really like this headset. For something casual it's great. The mic though, it's abysmal. Serious the sound is so tinny and hallow. I use a separate mic so it really not a problem.

            "question": "title: Give it a chance\ntext: I had to rework my expectations quite a bit, but I am in love with this game. I didn't expect that it was essentially a one-player game (2-player if you have a Pro controller), or that it basically presumes online play. With kids in the house I am generally uncomfortable with online gaming but Nintendo really did it well. I've still had a couple run-ins with vulgarity, but the kids didn't notice. It was inoffensive compared to plenty of standard voice chat language with more adult games.<br /><br />The eccentric aesthetic  put me off at first, and so did the initial impression I had with the gamepad motion controls. But give it a chance, it's so worth it.<br /><br />There are some seriously deep gameplay mechanics at work here. Levels are brilliantly designed, every one has secrets to discover. The range of weapons is astounding. The sound effects and visuals of the ink are so satisfying.<br /><br />I have spent way more time on this game than any other Wii U title. More than Super Mario Maker, Smash, Kart 8, or any of the other ~20 Wii U games I've bought (replaying Wind Waker might come close though). I'm a 35 year old mom and didn't expect I'd ever get this excited about a new franchise seemingly aimed at kids.<br /><br />The game initially released with little content, so a lot of early reviewers were unimpressed. It's a shame that clouded Splatoon's reputation, but after playing it for a month Nintendo has been surprisingly awesome about updates and it's pretty exciting.",

            "question": "title: A worthy sequel!\ntext: I’ve been playing the Dragon Quest series for about 30 years now (the original Dragon Warrior game came free with a Nintendo Power subscription.)  In fact, this series is what got me into RPGs, to begin with!<br /><br />For months now, I’ve been eagerly awaiting the release of Dragon Quest XI.  To date, I’ve played and enjoyed every release, except for DQX.  A review I saw said that this new installment felt old – it reused the same tropes that the previous games have played.  Well, there is a bit of truth to it.  Many of the familiar enemies show up, the combat, modes of exploration… Yes, this does feel very much like a Dragon Quest game, and that’s exactly what I was hoping for!<br /><br />The game is marvelously-rendered, and the scoring is beautiful.  I can’t say the story has been all that standard so far (not terribly surprising, but it has started off different than the previous installments.)  Some improvements have been made – save shrines, camp sites and the fact that you can actually see the enemies (yes, this has existed for a few of the previous games, but still worth noting!)  All the characters and NPCs I’ve met so far have added to the game, rather than detract from it.  While the main character is clearly someone in his mid-late teens, the game isn’t written to really make that a big deal, so I’m not getting the typical teen angst I normally pick up from JRPGs, and that’s a good thing.  I’m pushing 40 myself, so I can’t identify with those characters anymore.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this game to anyone who’s been a fan of the series, or to anyone who is looking to get started in the series, as it’s been quite solid so far.",

You can't play it until you go to Origin.com, register your purchase with the registration numbers that came with the discs, then download it and re-install from the download.  After you do that, you can play the game locally without being online, and don't have to have the game disc in the drive.  It's complicated and time-consuming to do all this.  You might want to buy by download in the first place, instead of buying discs and replacing disc installation later.<br /><br />Origin will try to get you to play online, but you don't have to, once the software is installed and properly registered.<br /><br />The game launcher for SIMS 3 will also try to get you to log on before opening a world, but you don't have to.<br /><br />The main thing is, if you got the game on disc, it's not going to work in Mac OS X unless you get the online download.  The reason for this is that EA Games didn't build SIMS 3 for Mac, ported from the PC version without doing good porting.  I learned this from a lot of study and research online when I couldn't get my disc-based SIMS 3 to work on my Mac.<br /><br />I like the game, but caution, if you're using Mac, it's better to buy it online via download than buy discs and go thorough all the hassle later of having to download anyway to make it work.<br /><br />Origin or EA Games would be original download sources.",

The adventure mode really stands out with a variety of mission types in many different environments with varied terrain.

The weather effects (wind, clouds, rain, snow) are very good and add a lot to the impressiveness of the game.  You'll almost find yourself shivering when flying through the snowstorms in one mission of the adventure mode!<br />The flying dynamics are pretty good - though perhaps a little &quot;floaty&quot;.  It does provide a good sense of being aloft.  You can see the control surfaces deflecting as you apply controls.  After playing for a few hours, you get a sense of &quot;feel&quot; for the aircraft you're flying.  For example, using the rudders in normal (not &quot;easy&quot;) control mode is important to tighten up turns and straighten the plane during wind gusts.<br />It is easy to see that a lot of work went into this game.

I missed Atelier Ayesha, Escha & Logy and Shallie since my PS3 died after Meruru and was upgrading to a PS4 at the time. (Can't comment on the last 3 games). Change of pace, light hearted, story character driven, they removed the time limit system from past games which helps you explore and develop characters without having to time every step and not make the days past. Share Play can be used, as well as streaming. No blocked parts.<br /><br />I'm glad i'm back playing the series. One of the main reasons I like them is the change of pace. It's light hearted game play and nothing overly serious like end of the world scenarios you see in almost every game. Character goals are more important, as well as alchemy and exploring the world and meeting new people. Gust tends to always bring characters from previous games back as cameos. Logy is in this, I know he was from the Escha game and comes back as a sword smith. Pamela has become a recurring character in almost every game (she's also in this). It also helps move the story seeing past characters since you connect with the previous game.. While this may sound tamed or dull to some, it's far from it. It does have special events that pop up that you must beat (monsters, dragons and demons) but story focus is on personal developments and exploring the world around you. It's very story focused with events popping up randomly or on intervals and each person has a 'friendship' meter. Which triggers events tied to them.<br /><br />Can't compare on the last 3 games fighting system but I do know they removed the &#34;limit break&#34; that was present Rorona, Totori and Meruru it was a special skill when a character reached a certain mode which was an ultimate attack and have now fused them into a team type ultimate attack instead on single. Each person does have thier own ultimate, they are just joined by the group present. They still have skills, items like uni bombs, lighting rods etc and the standard, heal, speed up, break, sleep, poison etc. If you're familiar with those (which is standard in most RPGS) it should be simple to jump into. If you're a fan of the series and missed a few games like I did, it should very easy to get use to it again. Alchemy system has been enhanced but for the most parts follows the standard theme. (traits, quality, levels) when mixing. You can still carry over traits like previous games. To people not use to the Atelier series, it may be hard to understand how the story flows since they dont hold your hand, you have to advance the story doing tasks or alchemy but eventually it opens up to character moment to move the story forward. In the status menu section the friendship meter appears in red or black. Some moments in the game require you to talk to characters to trigger events. Most the times it tells you in the &#34;idea section&#34; others you have to walk up to characters. They use a day/time system some events only happen at a specific time. This is not a negative, it just needs some getting use to if you're use to these types of games.<br /><br />Even though I missed the last 3, they still have some of the best music. Everything fits the game perfectly and like previous ones, they include vocal parts on special events. The rest that seem basic, grow on you and you start to appreciate it as time passes. My only regret was not buying the special edition, since I missed the last 3 games I wasn't sure if they could &#34;hook&#34; me again. THEY DID.",

            "question": "title: Excellent, when it works\ntext: This headset has a good sound and, because they are lighter than other similar headsets and they have very soft cushioned ear pads, they are extremely comfortable to wear. I have also been extremely pleased with the quality of the sound recorded from the microphone. I've used this headset for voice-over recordings, online gaming, and talking on Skype, and I've been thrilled with the quality. I've recommended this set to numerous friends and family members because of the high quality combined with the low price. However, although this set has a good sound and records very well, this set won't last very long. I bought my headset about a year ago, and it has worked splendidly for the last year. But, today I was using it to record some audio for a project and it crapped out on me. The earphones still sound fantastic, but the microphone no longer works. However, because of the cheap price and great quality, I've decided to purchase another set. Some people have reported sound problems, which also happened to my sister. I suspect that problem might be related to the long cord. The cord on this headset is about six feet long, which is great for an extended reach, but bad because it means there's a bigger chance that you're going to roll over the cord with your chair or snag it on something and yank it off your head (I believe my sister did that, which damaged the headset). So, if you're careful you may be able to avoid that problem. In my case, the mic stopped working, so I assume that the wires in the positionable microphone have become frayed or loose. Although I'd expect that to happen over time, I do not expect that to happen in just a year. However, this headset is so cheap and the quality of the sound is so good, I'm still going to purchase another set. The bottom line with this set: Fantastic sound reproduction and recording capabilities from a cheap-as-dirt headset, but you pay for that in shortened lifespan.",

The board is solid and high quality and can be connected via Bluetooth, USB cable, or the included wireless receiver. It also comes with a USB cable, keycap puller, and switch puller.<br /><br />My biggest issue with this keyboard is the confusing FN key combinations (that aren't listed in the included instruction manual). At one point, I somehow changed the current layer, and as a result, my number keys weren't working. I tried the combinations listed in the manual, but they didn't work. Fortunately I found a reddit post about long pressing FN+space to reset the keyboard (I believe this is also now listed on the product page, but it wasn't when this happened).<br /><br />The keyboard has key-specific lighting and there are several different lighting styles that you can choose from. I'm not crazy about lights, but it is important to some people.<br /><br />The keyboard is really satisfying to type on out-of-the-box, both from a feel and sound perspective. The space bar makes a nice sound (see video). I was not expecting such a nice typing experience at this price point.<br /><br />All said, I really enjoy using this keyboard and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a nice 60% keyboard without breaking the bank.",

            "question": "title: An outstanding game with seemingly endless possibilities\ntext: I'm not big on FPS games.  In fact, Morrowind, Oblivion and the newer Fallout games are about as close as I normally get to FPS.  I couldn't resist this game, however.  Being from Detroit kinda influenced that; I wanted to see how much of my hometown they incorporated.  I have to say, some things are familiar (including bums digging in the trash cans!)  They really encouraged exploration here, with shops and hidden passageways scattered about.  The streets of Detroit are more accurate than I expected, and they also included some nice landmarks.<br /><br />At any rate, I'm pretty much blown away by this game.  I really dig the story!  The game play is remarkably fluid, and I really love the graphics and the music.  The voice acting, for the most part, is top notch.  One thing that really draws me in is that combat isn't exactly forced on you.  Sometimes it's easier to simply take out the thugs.  Other times, moving a box and exposing a vent shaft will take you around them.  When it does come to combat, it seems pretty well done.  I'm terrible at FPS type games, but I seem to hold my own here (I am playing on \"Tell Me A Story...\"  I admit, I'm lame in that sense!)  Ultimately, this feels like a role playing game with a FPS twist.  You're not going to get a lot of sandboxing here like you would in Fallout or Oblivion, as the world you're in feels a bit smaller.  Don't get me wrong, there is some exploring to be done but not as much as the other titles mentioned.<br /><br />The level-up system is also nice, and leaves a lot of room for customization.  It seems like you really can't go wrong with whatever build you take.  It also allows you to focus more on stealth, or combat too, if you so desire.  Experience is given by completion of quest, as well as for kills and take-downs.  Yes, you have plenty of quests available!  Once  you complete the first mission (after the introductory mission,) you'll be given several side quests, as well as \"main quests\" that push the story forward.<br /><br />Another really nice feature:  I've noticed no bugs!  Granted, I try to get from point A to point B asap, and haven't seen everything I could.  Over all, I highly recommend this title!",

So far, I've used a basic Logitech mouse, an MX 518, and the Proteus Core in the last ten years. They all were my favorites mouses (yes, you heard me right: &#34;mouses&#34;), and I've been itching to replace the perfectly fine MX 518 I have at work, so I nabbed this one.<br /><br />I think what they're trying to here is merge their lower-end mouses with their higher-end gaming mouses, so that they're able to offer their features to those on a lower budget. So far, I think this is fantastic, but that doesn't mean there aren't issues. It looks, when the lights are off, and feels like a $15 Logitech mouse. Which isn't a bad thing.<br />Every Logitech mouse I've used is far better than most of the alternatives. They make great mouse, and I will continue to source my non-trackball input devices from them in the future. On my desk, it looks like the old, beige Logitech one I had when I first started at this job, which most likely came with one of their computers years ago. The click isn't really sensitive as there's not much down stroke, and it's VERY low-profile. I use a fingertip grip and this thing can get a bit uncomfortable for me at times.<br /><br />As for settings, you can use a few of the more basic settings you can from other gaming mouses. You can't switch between as many settings as more-dedicated gaming mouses, but they're still there. For a work computer, this mouse improves my navigation by a ton, but, like a said, the size does make it a bit uncomfortable for long periods of time.<br /><br />The scroll wheel has no infinite scroll feature, which is the biggest physical downfall I found in terms of physical features. The side buttons are placed better than the MX 518 as I can reach them more easily, and the middle button behind the wheel acts as the tracking speed switcher. The scroll wheel can act as another button upon pressing, if you like, but I have that switched to off as I don't find it necessary for my use.<br /><br />The light does have RGB, but I keep it on a cool blue all the time. You can have it set to either on or off, but I prefer on at a very low setting. I wish it would turn off completely after being idle after a while, but if you leave it on the &#34;on&#34; setting it remains on until the power source (i.e., the computer) is completely off.<br /><br />If you think of it as a budget office mouse with neat little gaming features, then this one will serve handsomely. At $40 retail, however, I think it's priced a little high. Knock it down $10 and this will be the go-to mouse for all looking for a great mouse under $50.",

Also the `play' button for the Cake shop once in a while is unclickable, so you cannot even begin the next level, it just freezes up.<br /><br />The Flower shop is just way too difficult and takes all the fun out of the game.<br />Also, there is a town money glitch: I had upgraded all my shops, but for some reason the Flower shop wont stay upgraded. It reverts on it's own right back to the first level before upgrading, but yet all my money that I spent on upgrading it is gone. All the other shops stay upgraded, so I don't understand why the Flower Shop doesn't.<br /><br />One thing I am very disappointed about is the blatant reference to the French people. In the game, when upgrading Jill's cake shop, she says: \"Ooh la la, Customers Will Think They Are In Less-rude Version Of France\".<br />If the game writers had said \"Wow, Customers Will Think They Are In A Less-self Centered Version Of America\" I bet the gaming public here in the USA would be upset and making complaints. But because this uneducated, derogatory, racist comment is directed at another country it is overlooked and dismissed I guess. I know from first hand experience from actually being in France, that this disgraceful stereotype is completely incorrect and unjustified, and shows the writers to be ignorant.<br />No entire group of people or country should be labeled in such way, it doesn't matter if it's Americans, Canadians, Russians, Germans, Italians, or the French etc.. There are rude people everywhere in the world, that does not mean that the entire population of one country are rude just because some of it's people are.  The writers for this game are labeling all the people of an entire country as being bad-mannered and discourteous, when ironically their offensive comment shows them to be the ones who are bad-mannered, discourteous, rude.<br />I wish I could get my money back for this game.",

I thought this would be a nice addition although it was simply too big.<br /><br />While based on the dimensions it should have worked, due to my swiveling desktop being made up of 2 surfaces, one for the keyboard and the other for the mouse, there was no way to have this lay flat across both.  This is certainly not a failing of the product, only my experience.<br /><br />I have ended up using this beneath my PC and server on the table next to my recliner and it looks great while providing a soft surface for my computer equipment to rest.<br /><br />While this does not come with a micro USB cable I always have additional so this wasn’t an issue but should be known.  I have mine plugged into a multi USB outlet that automatically adjusts to the power required for whatever is plugged into it, it’s provided constant power without issue.<br /><br />I feel that the color descriptions are accurate.  I have tested this product over the last 2 months and what I have found is when set to any of the scrolling color modes it continually flickers every few seconds which is very distracting (see video).  While it didn’t do this in the beginning it now happens nearly continually.  This is not an issue in the breathing color changing modes but, for me, makes the scrolling modes unusable.  I have tested changing cables and outlets but neither makes a difference therefore this is a defect with the product.<br /><br />While the lights are bright and vibrant, the patterns varied, the defect I have encountered makes this a product I would not recommend.",

Because this game has been dumbed down so much so that it isn't even challenging.  The first day I got it I played for about 4 hours and thought \"wow, this is really easy!\".  But that's not my only complaint.  Here are my pro's and con's:<br /><br />Pro's:  The graphics are gorgeous and I like the attention to detail.<br /><br />Con's:  1. This is my game, I bought it, so why are they telling me I have to be on their servers to be able to play it? 2. Speaking of servers, they are down, a lot.  I haven't been able to get in since I bought it on Tuesday when it came out.  That's three days of no game play for a game I paid $60 bucks for.  3. The size of land they give you is way too small. With the amount of residential they want you to build it gives no room to expand other buildings like your town hall for example. 4. Like I said before, this game has been dumbed down so much so that it presents absolutely no challenge.  Be prepared to get bored very quickly.  5. I complained about this in SimCity 4, where are the scenarios?  SimCity 3000 had them and they were awesome!  I loved going in and fixing cities and making them prosper.  Huge disappointment that they aren't there.  6. This game does not allow you to save, so when the servers go down you have to start all over again.  My husband has this game and he has had to start over 2 times now.  When I say start over I mean having to do the tutorial and completely start over.  All his progress was completely gone.  7. Why can't I just plant some trees?  Why does it have to be a park that has to be attached to a street?  That takes up way too much space and wipes out houses all around it.  Like I said before space is very limited.  8. Someone else said it and I completely agree.  It feels like I am renting this game.  I'm allowed to download it to my computer and take up space, but I'm not allowed to save it to my hard drive and play it when I want to. 9. Since this game is online only, what happens when EA decides to pull the plug permanantly on the servers?  You will have a game you paid a lot of money for that will be unplayable.  That right there is NOT acceptable!!<br /><br />Well I guess I am dumb because I fell for the hype and bought it the day it came out.  So I guess EA and maxis were right.  I hope they get reported and get severely punished for providing such a sub-standard product.",

At the beginning I was very put off by the nearly-unmanageable cursor, but after removing all the other [user] background tasks on my 3 GHz machine, I found it possible, though still very annoying, to work with. The problem with cursor management is simply that there is an extraordinary amount of other &quot;stuff&quot; going on in the game, and cursor positions are not updated often enough. One would hope that the relative amount of time devoted to mouse position polling and other functions can be slightly modified to give the kind of smooth mouse action usually found. In contrast to the mouse, the motion keys [arrow keys] are a bit over-sensitive, and one will find that a mix of walk/run and 1st person/3rd person views to be most useful.",

            "question": "title: A review from someone who is actually playing it....not just saying my kid likes it...and a bit of comparison to the 3ds version\ntext: Love it.  Great graphics, fun modes and lots to do. Terrific voice acting and characters.  I have the 3ds version and the portal works fine with the PS3.  The console version really is a whole lot better than the 3ds version but the 3ds version is more of a platformer, you can store two Skylanders and just swap them out by tapping their icon on the bottom screen and they can jump.  Other than that, the PS3 version is a much more immersive and richer game.  I think this is a game for the whole family to enjoy and I have played a heck of a lot of games since 1978.  Infact, it sort of reminds me of old fashioned Diablo type dungeon crawling (and some Skylanders have similar type abilities) but most of the adventuring takes place in well lit areas and even though the NPCs are cute they are not &#34;sticky sweet&#34; or too childish for adults who just want to experience a fun game. I love the bright colors and the little details like ice forming on the ship...or little puddles on the deck.  And it is FUN. I like buying the character updrades in this version as that is not an option but is automatic in the 3ds version.  Skylanders transferred from the 3ds retain their LEVELS but not their upgrades.  Hats in this version actually have a purpose and can effect stats in many different ways such as making a Skylander faster or better defensively.  In the 3ds version hats just sit on their heads and look cool...lol....no effects at all.  I waited for this version and the figures to become a little more affordable and honestly, it's one of those rare times I wish I had just bought it on release day because it's that good and would have been well worth the price. Finding new figures in the stores is almost impossible now. Good news-- It's ok to buy Skylanders used if you want to or don't have a bunch of cash....this version has an option to reset the Skylander so you can do all its stats, leveling up yourself.  Also...the best thing about BOTH games....you really only have to have 1 giant and a Skylander of each element to play the game effectively and enjoy all the parts.  So...I think that comes down to your giant and 7 of the other elements.  And since you can use Skylanders from the original game, there's lots to pick from and enjoy.  Of course, you'll want more than 8 but it's like eating an elephant---ONE bite at a time will get you there :)  At first I thought the figures were a horrible gimmick idea but now that more and more games on any system are requring you to pay for additional DLC...this is really cool since you have a figure and a game character to show for your money spent.  There's no online mode for the battle arenas....that's the only thing I don't like about this game. I've been fairly dependent on online for quick games with other people for several years so no online battle option feels like a step backwards in gaming.  Other than that, i think the concept is amazing, the game plays very well, the modes mix it up, replay value is strong for each level and for each figure you collect.  I think it's superb and would think anyone who likes games could enjoy this nearly perfect game.",

            "question": "title: *New* Nintendo 3DS\ntext: I have an original Ambassador 3DS from the 2011 launch, long before they introduced the XL models. When the XL models did come out, I did not upgrade to the XL, because I had already gotten used to the form factor of the original 3DS. I carried it everywhere. I don't carry a bag, so it was always in my pockets. Not too big, and not too heavy, it was not uncomfortable.<br /><br />When Nintendo announced the *New* generation, I was excited, but that excitement quickly diminished as they indicated their intent to only release the XL version in the US. Well, Nintendo can sell me a game based around an Italian plumber and I would buy it, so with the prospects of a regular sized 3DS looking dim, I reluctantly upgraded to the *New* XL model. It WAS big, and took a very long time for me to get used to the size. I don't have large hands, so I ended up getting a bit cramped, and forget about carrying it in my pocket. I would need a belt and suspenders to keep my pants up, it was so heavy. I could barely use the new C-stick because I felt like a 2-year old trying to learn piano when my fingers just didn't reach that far.<br /><br />Nintendo does a U-turn and decides to release the regular sized *New* 3DS, so what else was I to do? I &#34;downgraded&#34; from the XL, and I'm a happy person now. I'm still amazed at Nintendo's original intent of a non-release, but at least they finally appeared to listen to us fans and we got what we've been wanting.<br /><br />As for the *New* 3DS itself:<br /><br />I've done a system transfer a few times now, and either it's becoming second nature, or they've streamlined it very well. The transfer process is a fairly painless walkthru, and afterwards, you move the SD card from the old to the new; the old gets wiped to factory defaults, and when you turn on the new, you'd never notice a difference. I exaggerate. Who could not noticed going from a brick sized XL model to a comfortable regular one? But you get my point, right?<br /><br />This version came pre-shipped with three Happy Home Wrecker top faceplates, so I installed the Isabelle faceplate. Installing the top faceplate is tool-free, it just snaps in. The bottom faceplate requires a small phillips-head screw driver, but you still need to remove the bottom to install the SD card even if you are not swapping the plate. Right now, there are not many faceplates available outside Japan, but from my understanding, the Japanese plates fit the international models, so if you find a good cheap exporter, you should be good.<br /><br />You will still need a 3DS charger, as they've stopped shipping those with the *New* generation. I dunno why. Packaging is a bit smaller, but it certainly doesn't endear brand-new customers who find out their shiney new handheld needs to be charged with an unsupplied charger. Unlike tablets or non-Apple phones, the charger is not any USB variant, but there appears to be several USB-to-3DS adapters altho I've not used one myself.<br /><br />The stylus is smaller, and just as cramped as ever, so invest in a pen-sized one if you can. It's worth it. I actually use a retractable ball-point pen with the ink cartridge removed.<br /><br />Both versions of the *New* generation have improved on the 3D aspects, so whether you like the XL size or regular size, that alone is something to consider. I barely used 3D mode, and I don't know how, but it works significantly better so that I'm starting to turn it on more often.<br /><br />I can't comment on battery life, since I've not played very long, but there are indicators that it's about 4 hours. My original 3DS was upgrade with a Nyko PowerPak which gave it beefy battery life with minimal additional bulk or weight, so here's hoping that Nyko will have a new version out soon.",

            "question": "title: Excellent headset with high-end features; best bang for buck!\ntext: This headset represents fantastic bang-for-the-buck. They're not &#34;oh my god!&#34; amazing, but they are far better than I expected for the ~$45 price tag. I anticipated burning through them fairly quickly (out of dissatisfaction or low build quality) and moving up, but I always like to give entry-options a whirl. These are a surprisingly great piece of hardware!<br /><br />Pros include really decent sound (both headphone and mic), nice inline controls, really well designed microphone (I love how it bends and easily swivels out of your way if not using), comfortable padding around the ears, a nice braided cable, nice swivel ear cup design, and other features that I would anticipate on a higher quality set only. However, it's not without some drawbacks. The biggest drawback is that, despite the fairly ample padding on the headband, these things hurt the top of my head. I've gotten used to it, and they no longer bother me, but for a long time, I could only use them for 20 minutes at a time or so, before my head was really sore. Wearing a hat helped some, but ironically, now seems to make it worse. The only other problem I've had with these is that the sound from the headphones sometimes bleeds over into the mic. When I'm playing a game and I'm talking, people can often hear my in-game sounds, whereas they should only be hearing my voice. I don't think it's a volume thing with sound escaping the headphones. I get the impression that the audio is bleeding over somehow, be it a hardware or software problem. Then again, I could be wrong about the origin of the problem.<br /><br />That said, it's a small drawback in an otherwise really great headset. I'm not sure that paying two or three times as much as any chance of netting you a two or three time gain in quality. The fact is, these things are surprisingly high-quality, and I'm impressed. From someone who has gone through a fair number of headsets, and who wasn't expecting much, I'm pleased to say I'd buy these again in a heartbeat.",

There as a three month tryst with Final Fantasy XI before WoW, and another few month fling with Guild Wars 2 during my 2 year hiatus from WoW.  But I inevitably came back to this game.  I played until the launch of Cataclysm, which in my opinion, was dismal.  They ruined my favorite class (ret paladin) and seemed to try to recycle a lot of old content. So I quit.  Anyway, after chatting with some friends about our old days, I decided to give Mists of Pandaria a try.  They insisted it was better.  Well, they were right.  It is an improvement upon Cataclysm.<br /><br />I started playing about 3 weeks ago, and since then, I've managed to level 2 of my higher levels to 90, and see the first 2 sets of raids.  I have returned to many changes. Many were for the better.  Some, well... not so much.  Here is what I've noticed.  (Please note that I have been away for a couple years, and I might not know when such changes were implemented.)<br /><br />The good:<br /><br />1.  On an asthetic level, WoW has seen some substantial improvements.  You don't need the best hardware to crank everything up, which seems to be Blizzards MO.  The world is still a bit cartoon like, but that is part of its charm (and always has been!)<br />2.  The Raid and Dungeon finder has made things much nicer for casuals.  You do run the risk of running with inappropriately skilled/geared players, but over all, it is a nice feature.  It seems to have been improved since I quit (and Raid Finder is completely new.)  Some folks complain about LFR for a number of reasons - lower gear quality and reduced fight mechanics.  I am personally fine with this.  I mainly play to see content.  Not have the best purples.  It would, however, be nice to see a buff given to tanks who meet the minimum gear requirement.  Speaking as someone who started tanking heroics with an item level of 440 last week, it can be hard to maintain threat when 2 or 3 of your DPS are pulling 100k plus.<br />3.  Guild Perks!  Experience and rep boosts, mass resurrection, faster flying...  The list goes on.  Very nice for leveling an alt!  (Though it could be bad if you're a sucker for the story...  you tend to outgrow quest zones and dungeons pretty fast.)<br />4.  Traveling is considerably more convenient.  Most classes have at least an optional bonus to movement speed perk to choose from, and they seem to have allowed mounts in more areas.<br />5.  I leveled a Death Knight from 55 as a blacksmith/miner.  They rearranged the zones, so gathering had a few hang-ups.  But once I got going, things were a lot easier (mainly because I could fly from level 60 on.)<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />1.  The change I like the least is probably the Cross Realm business.  Zones are flat out crowded now.  I've had to wait in line to kill a unique mob, and folks seem to be fighting over items to be gathered.  Depending on the time of day, questing can be nearly as bad as it is during launch week.  I get that Cross Realm dungeon finder was necessary.  I can even see why they'd want it for regular zones, as well.  But they should tone it down a bit.  (I was in Loch Modan last night, and the place was CRAWLING with panda.)<br />2.  Scenarios!  These are flat out boring.  There is one that gives you a 450 weapon of choice.  That is worth doing once you hit level 90, and if you didn't get lucky in any of the higher level dungeons on normal mode.<br />3.  The Isle of Thunder.  It's a crazy rep grind.  I suppose it would be worth it if you're in a hard-core raiding guild.  I took my Death Knight there as soon as he hit 90 (in quest greens and blues.)  It seems to me that the place was tuned for people who were at least raid-ready.  The non-elite mobs have about 500k health, and the elites have way more.<br />4.  The music in this expansion is flat out annoying.  This is sad, because music has been one of Blizzard's strongest suits in ALL of their games.<br />5.  I didn't spend much time in Cataclysm dungeons, and I didn't step foot in a single raid from that content.  The dungeons in this expansion are pretty lame.  I don't care much for the story line in many of them (Stormstout Brewery, for example.)  The boss fights and mobs seem pretty annoying.  I appreciate that they are trying to add new mechanics into the dungeons.  Some things worked.  Some didn't.  It would be nice if they allowed us to skip some of the NPC dialog once we've seen it once.<br />6.  While the story line here seems a bit more original than what they did with Cataclysm, I still don't care for it as much.  The Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King both had outstanding stories.<br /><br />The Nit-Picks:<br /><br />1.  Pandas!  This was just like all the other expansions where they introduced new classes/races.  Everyone needs to be the new thing.  I rolled a dwarf shaman, and I was the only non-panda in a Shadowfang Keep run!<br />2.  My Death Knight is a blacksmith. I've leveled up through WotLK in the passed.  Cataclysm's gear seemed like it was pretty logical.  I am not happy with some of the changes they made.  All the ghost-forged armor pieces have \"random enchants.\"  This would be more annoying if we weren't tripping over ghost iron nodes, but is still slightly annoying none the less.  There is no control over what stats you get on a piece of armor, and sometimes you have to make several in order to get the desired result.  It is nice that they gave you about a 10% chance to make a level 415 blue, however.  I also don't like how they made Living Steel a main component in all epic gear (in relatively large quantities, no less.)  Lightning Steel is pretty much useless.  The only purpose it serves is to \"learn\" new plans on a once-daily cool down.<br />3.  A huge focus on daily questing for rep.  I liked the dungeon grinds better.  Wrath of the Lich King seemed to have the best flexibility with rep grinds!  Choice daily quests and tabbards for the desired faction!",

The plug's and USB connections are all in tact with no issues, my volume control works great, the LED lights are really neat and I can choose to have them off when not in use.<br />They fit me really well and are comfortable on my ears and the adjustments work pretty good. The sound is really crisp and in fact I hear very little background noise when I have them on, this is nice for sitting in the living while the family watches a movie. The microphone works great and the sound is good. I used it to record sound onto a video and I had no issues with static or other things.<br /><br />Overall, well crafted they work just as they should, the LED lights are cute and fun, the sound is really nice, the microphone is good too, and they are comfortable.<br />I do stress that you read the description before you buy because they are not a USB headset so you will get no sound unless you plug them in to your sound input.

My computer and wireless router are located on the first floor with my Xbox 360 on the second floor, one room to the left from being directly above the router.  Although it establishes a connection, the signal strength is limited and greatly impedes game play.  Playing Halo 3 on Xbox Live is nearly impossible due to lag in play, pauses, connection disruption, and ratcteting movement.<br />  The problem did not seem to be attributed to the router.  I tested this by placing my laptop next to the Xbox 360 console and compared signal strength.  The laptop's signal strength had 5 green bars while the Xbox 360 adapter registered one red bar.<br />  I also tested the adapter itself by bringing the Xbox 360 downstairs to the same floor.  Under these conditions, the wireless adapter's signal strength measured 5 green bars.<br />  In my opinion, the Microsoft Wireless Adapter is limited in it's capabilities.  It appears well suited for specific wireless environments.  These include large open rooms and same floor situations with few obstructions.  Basically the adapter should be used in close proximity to your wireless router or wireless access point.<br />  As for my dilema, I resolved my issue by purchasing a Belkin 100ft ethernet cable and spending an afternoon running cable through my basement and a few walls to establish a direct connection.

            "question": "title: Unexpectedly awesome\ntext: I'm very surprised to be reviewing this game -- let alone giving it five stars. When my husband received \"Mass Effect\" for Christmas, I thought I'd be spending a lot of time rolling my eyes and reading a book while he was shooting stuff, not fighting him for the Xbox controller!<br /><br />So, I'm not a hardcore gamer, and I'm not going to review this game pretending I'm one. I'm writing this from the perspective of a 31-year-old wife and mom whose interest in Xbox games has mostly been limited to \"Oblivion\" and \"Guitar Hero\" until now.<br /><br />The graphics in \"Mass Effect\" are unbelievable, even better than \"Oblivion,\" I think -- particularly when it comes to the characters. One thing I didn't like about \"Oblivion\" was that it was nearly impossible to make a female character who didn't look like a man. Maybe that seems like a minor thing to other people, but when I spend a lot of time playing a game (about 30 hours in this case), I want to be happy with the way my character looks. My \"Mass Effect\" character came out pretty darn cute, if I do say so myself! (One of my husband's friends was over once when I was playing and said, \"Whoa! Who's she? I haven't met that character!\")<br /><br />In addition, the alien worlds that you visit look great. There are tons of them, and there's a lot of things to explore on each one (including stuff that doesn't show up on your map.)<br /><br />The controls were easy for me to use. Normally, I hate \"shooting games\" because it's too hard for me to aim (I'd just rather hack away at something with a sword), but after a little practice, I was doing pretty good. By the end (with upgraded weapons), I found I was actually taking out guys with one shot. Sweet!<br /><br />The way the weapons and armor were displayed also made it easy for me to figure out which was the best choice for my character or other team member. In some games, particularly \"Neverwinter Nights\" for the PC, I've had to ask my husband to help me figure out which one will do the most damage. Not a problem here. One small complaint: In the screen where you switch which weapon you're armed with, it'd be nice to have them labeled with the TYPE of weapon (pistol, assault rifle, etc.) -- I'm not gun-savvy enough to figure out which is which based on the little sketch.<br /><br />I really liked the RPG aspects of the game. At times, it was a little talky, but I really liked that the focus wasn't 100 percent on combat. I also liked the option of incorporating romance into the game. (So sue me, I'm a chick!)<br /><br />The plot -- about a rogue Spectre (sort of a special agent) who's trying to bring an ancient power back to the galaxy -- kept me interested, too. I guess it's just a variation on the standard RPG plot of \"cult tries to take over the world,\" but it's done well.<br /><br />The end does seem to leave the game wide-open for a sequel -- and I think that's a good thing. I'll definitely be fighting my husband to play that one, too.",

I won't spoil anything, but at a point in the game you get locked out of the world for the entire last chunk of the game.  In this section, the plot seems to go into overdrive with the story speeding through plot twists like crazy with no explanation or delving any deeper or explaining anything.  By the end, I felt exhausted, confused, and disappointed.  I've been told that they will be expanding on this end content to fix this issue, but I don't know if this is true or how much this would actually fix this issue since it encompasses a good MANY hours.<br /><br />Up until this point, I loved this game.  It felt great to just chill on long drives and combat was a lot of fun.  The best part of this game, as many others have said, are the bro-team.  Like many others, I definitely recommend watching the short anime series first as it really does add more depth to the characters.  You really do start to feel for these guys and come to really love them, which made it suck all the more when things got crap, but it was still a good rid until then.<br /><br />I might bump it up a star if the last fourth of the game is improved, but for now I can't fully recommend the game as I only really truly enjoyed 3/4ths of the game.",

These are probably more fun for little kids since it makes them feel like they are playing golf. The golf club part can come off and be put back on, so it is possible to switch the red club part with the blue controller part and vice versa. The side buttons are still easy to use since they have a thing you can push down on over them, so that it works. The LR buttons are partially obscured by the plastic backs but still reachable and clickable. The joycons slip right into these and are easy to take out and put back in. And it has those straps that you can use to attach to your wrist when playing, so it's less likely for the remote to fly out of your hand if you use them.",

            "question": "title: Pros & Cons review\ntext: Ok let me start by saying that this game is really fun but it does have some fatal flaws that you should look at before buying it.<br /><br />The Pros:<br />-Good Campaign Story<br />-Brought Back and Revolutionized Zombies<br />-A lot of Extra Map Packs for Purchase<br />-A new and better lvling system in multiplayer<br />-A wide Range of Gun selection<br />-No more Noob-Tubing<br />-You can now Purchase your guns with money you earn rather than break your back with stupid achievements.<br />-You can Make your own Emblem<br />-Way better Killstreaks<br />-Improved Graphics<br />-Overall Very Fun!<br /><br />The Cons:<br />-Campaign Gameplay is rather bland<br />-You'll lose connection to the game host more often<br />-Some Guns are not Accurately portrayed (Some Guns like M16 are 3 round bursts only and FAMAS is full auto only, also the AK47 is weaker than the M16?)<br />-They got rid of the SCAR<br /><br />Overall you can plainly see that the Pros really outweigh the cons by A LOT! They have a storyline their just because but this really is a game that was made to shine for multiplayer and in fact in many ways I think it's much better than MW3 and MW2 and is a much more balanced and realistic gameplay. You get most of the most reputable guns of the cold war and even some rarely seen and unique ones! This is definatley a game your gonna want to pick up and try. The main reason I think people are dissapointed in this game is the same reason for most games/movies of this league.....OVER HYPE! Some people who gave this game a horrid rating do not have an open mind either to this style of gameplay or the reality of the design of this game. Is this game for everyone? No. But if you like fast paced action/first person shooters and like to interact with others than I highly urge you to give this game a go! Please note that if you do not have internet set up or dont like multiplayer games that you will HATE this game because it all revolves around human interaction for it's fun. If you like going solo go for Call of Duty 1,2,3, and World at War and maybe Call of Duty 4. And yes SCAR lovers I do feel your pain too. But try to lighten up, their are a ton of good guns that can take the place of your SCAR for at least one Call of Duty game.",

When it comes to the DS titles, DQ4 and DQ5 are amazingly good.  This one isn't bad, but it felt \"weird\" do me.  The story and game play, for the most part, were good.  I really didn't like certain mechanics, however.  For example, talking to EVERYTHING in a town before you can advance the story (including the animals) was frustrating and annoying.  A tower was dark and filled with pit-falls, yet you had to navigate through them.  I don't mind a little challenge, but I hate tedium, and that's what I felt like I had in this game from time to time (more frequent than the normal grind-induced tedium from the other games in the series.)<br /><br />This game is certainly not bad, and definitely worth investing in for the hard-core Dragon Quest fan.

            "question": "title: A most excellent pinball game, even on XP, if you know how.\ntext: Big Race USA is a well crafted 3D delight. The ray-traced graphics are true-to-life, colorful and stunning. The physics are superb, endowing the steel balls with realistic movement and mass. The tunes are catchy, sound-effects authentic and the voices and spoken lines are hilarious. At high power settings, a flipper will make the ball smack the glass hard, which is very satisfying. It's like having a real, spanking new, well-tuned pinball machine in your room.<br /><br />The operator's menu lets you create a custom difficulty level where you can choose the number of balls, set how long the ball-saver remains active and tune every other conceivable parameter of game play and scoring. The table-setup option lets you adjust table slope, machine condition and flipper power. You can make it respond like a factory-fresh dream or like a beat-up bar machine if you want. Extras let you examine the 3D game surface in detail with the ability to zoom in to high-resolution close-ups.<br /><br />I've had this CD for years but I recently tried it on Windows XP with my new Athlon 64 4000+ screamer and was disappointed to find the flipper response was slow and even intermittent. It turns out that XP is not entirely compatible with the versions of Windows that Big Race USA was made for, rendering it unplayable. Fortunately I found a solution on the Web. Run it in Windows 2000 compatibility mode! When I did, all the flipper sluggishness disappeared and the game was fun again.<br /><br />I play this on my new system in full screen mode, at the highest video resolution with all the bells and whistles turned on. It runs flawlessly with minimal latency. This game is a beauty to behold, still plays well on modern hardware and I strongly recommend you get yourself a copy.",

            "question": "title: The Lost Valley, version 2.0\ntext: If you're familiar with Natsume's take on the Harvest Moon games called The Lost Valley (TLV), you'll already be familiar with this one. This is basically TLV 2.0. They improved a few things, tweaked the story a bit, but much is still the same. Like TLV, there's a lot of potential but it ends up being undeveloped or issues ignored.<br /><br />For me, frustration factor outweighs enjoyment and after 30 hours and just over two in-game years, this is getting put away.<br /><br />The camera is still the camera. It's an automatic camera that magically swings around without your input, but more often than not, ends up looking in a direction I don't want. You can use the shoulder buttons to swing the camera manually, but there is no way to override the automatic focus.<br /><br />There are two other camera views: overhead and farming. Both are essentially the same, but farming view keeps your character pointed in the same direction, making it easier to more quickly terraform or farm. But these additional camera views still have an automatic focus and will still swing around. Take an example. I'm trying to dig out a path to the Underworld, which is on the same edge as the town entrance. No matter which camera view I try to use, it still swings wildly and makes it extremely difficult to see exactly where I am digging. Just give us a straight view with no automatic swings.<br /><br />Objects such as people and animals are impassable barriers. If anything is in your way, you will not get around it. I found this more pronounced in the barn. I have four animals (horse, sheep, cow and donkey) and they can't get out of their way to eat their food. You can watch them try to perform this intricate dance to maneuver around each other to reach their feed troughs. If an NPC or two are in the barn, navigation space is even more limited. I've seen them get stuck in a corner, walking into the wall. The workaround is to either exit and re-enter (rezone) or pull up a menu like the save menu. If a harvest sprite is blocking the bridge to the harvest goddess, well, rezone...<br /><br />Boulders spawning right in front of my house. Often. Like, several times a week. When I wake up and go to the valley, it's like there was a meteor shower, last night, and every night. Trees will respawn too. Sometimes you'll rezone on the same day, and where there was no boulder or tree five minutes ago, oh wait, there's one now... It's just too aggressive.<br /><br />Resource acquisition is rage inducing. You'll need a metric ton of a particularly rare material but the resource node only respawns once every few days. I've long since been at 100% with my selected marriage candidate but I will never get material. The workaround is something called save scumming, which is to save just prior to hitting a resource node, and reloading if you do not get what you need. This should really not be a viable gaming strategy. Another workaround is to use the harvest sprites, but they only work once every other day, and weekends off.<br /><br />I've mentioned &#34;the work around&#34; at least twice. Workarounds are illustrative of design flaws.",

Instead, I have to say it's because we like to finish what we started. The impression we get of this game is that the programmers had to rush to get it to production and abandoned any hope of creative programming about halfway through it. It's less of a game, and more of a story line with things you can do to entertain yourself... at least until about halfway through when you have run out of things to actually do and end up simply wandering around the game platform hoping for encounters with characters. And there are no shortcuts to take you to places faster. How hard would it have been to include an interactive map where you could point to a destination and it would take you there? Apparently too hard for these programmers. Or maybe that would have just made the game too short because you can waste an incredible amount of time wandering around in this game, doing nothing. I can just hear the brainstorming that went into creating this game: \"Okay, guys, we now have the story line and the gamer cannot mess with that until the end of the game, but the game is too short. Let's throw in a couple of seemingly important tasks to distract the player from the fact that they are actually doing nothing to solve a mystery! How about a parachute to nowhere? Or a radio that does nothing? You know what? The story is set around WWII, let's throw in a little meaningless Nazi teaser.\" I hate to give a bad review to something, but, really, if something is going to be advertised as a 'game', I'd like to see a little more finesse in how it allows the player to interact. Otherwise, just advertise it as a walk-through experience, which is more accurate. I'm so glad I didn't pay full price for this game, which is completely not worth it.

If I put one on my laptop, and one on my computer, then upgrade my computer (I do this every three years or so), this game becomes useless.  I will have to write EA and get permission to install this game if I want to continue to use it.  Now here is the kicker.  People who STEAL this game will have unlimited usage and will not have to contact EA.  In fact if EA goes out of business some day I will be SOL, but the criminal will still have a working copy of the game....  You be the judge.  Consumers can STOP this type of DRM (Digital Rights Management) by not buying this type of product.",

There are different versions and levels of each game, which keeps things interesting. You can play the games by yourself or with others! As you play and win, you earn cool stuff to put into an interactive room. Other cool aspects of this video game is the inviting colors and graphics/animation that are very fun as well.

            "question": "title: Singing gondoliers, gelato, nightclubs and sleuthing, oh my!\ntext: In Nancy's eighteenth adventure from HerInteractive, Nancy makes good use of her passport in her second international outing, this time to Venice, Italy during Carnevale. Her old friend Prudence Rutherford (first heard from in [[ASIN:B000066ST3 Nancy Drew: Secret of the Scarlet Hand]]) has enlists her to discover the identity of the Phantom, a masked robber who's been making off with priceless antiques. The mysterious Phantom escapes detection, having knowledge of the security systems for each site.<br /><br />Nancy's home base is Prudence's old palazzo, the Ca' Nascosta, now in a sad state of disrepair after Prudence sold it to a penny-pinching, ladder-climbing socialite. Nancy shares a room with Helena Berg, a young German journalist who is in love with Venice and hopes to move there. A British art restorer, Colin Baxter, develops a huge crush on Nancy while working on the Ca' and tries in vain to win her affection.<br /><br />Italian culture is everywhere, and Nancy must even learn some basic Italian in order to participate in an important stakeout. You carry an Italian dictionary, which comes in useful for translating signs and documents. The background audio includes several conversations in Italian, but if you don't speak Italian, these aren't crucial to the game. Many times, characters are simply commenting on the Phantom and his adventures, or about personal events. Also included are several flavors of Italian gelato, the Italian card game Scopa, the various Carnevale masks, and Venetian architecture.<br /><br />Nancy is working with the Guardia di Finanza, Italy's version of the FBI, to track the Phantom. Because it's Carnevale season, there aren't enough officers to tail him, so Nancy is given a PDA with tracking capabilities. There are several possible suspects, including Antonio Fango, the shady IT dealer who works across from Nancy's temporary residence, Enrico Tazza , a member of the Machiano Crime Syndicate and a fence for stolen goods , Colin, who has past secrets to hide, and the mysterious (and ungracious) hostess La Contessa Margherita Fauberg. Nancy has three modes of transportation: on foot (free), via vaporetto (water taxi, free), or by singing gondolier (between five and fifteen euros per trip). The main map is clearly laid out and is easy to navigate.<br /><br />Like [[ASIN:B0009X6QJM Nancy Drew: Secret Of the Old Clock]], Nancy must earn money in order to purchase items needed in her investigation, including books and costume accessories. You begin the game with 200 Euros, and if you budget very wisely, you won't need extra money (those fashionable shopping trips, gelato cones and singing gondoliers really add up!). If you find yourself running short, there are several ways to earn extra income, including dancing in a nightclub dressed as a slinky black cat (!).I loved the variety of the nightclub dancing, although the character animation was jerky and I would have liked to see Nancy move more than just rotating her wrist in-between moves. From my own experience, you can earn between two to over thirty euros per dance depending on how well you nail the cues (for the hearing-impaired: the dance cues are auditory, but flashing colored lights also tell you which colored button to press).<br /><br />I played the game on the Senior Detective level, which offers fewer step-by-step hints (there's no to-do list, for one) and more difficult puzzles, and the majority of the puzzles were sufficiently intuitive, but still challenging. The graphics are gorgeous as always; in scenes of the canals, visible from your bedroom balcony, the water ripples in real time. If you choose to ride a gondola (the amount varies depending on the gondolier), you're treated to a combination of still photos of Venice and rendered scenery which proves quite effective (along with the various Italian-language serenades taken from Italian opera and popular songs). Unlike some prior greats such as [[ASIN:B000V728P2 Nancy Drew: The Legend of the Crystal Skull]] and [[ASIN:B0002ZALES Nancy Drew: Curse of Blackmoor Manor]], the actual story in \"Phantom of Venice\" is spread a bit thin; the game could have benefitted from one or two additional suspects. But the variety of puzzles, some of which are new to the series (stakeouts, tracking, jewel heists), and the inclusion of Italian culture make up for these shortcomings.",

The game wouldnt let me be named Jaques, which was interesting, as it kept forcing me to \"pick a name\" and just would re-ask once i entered Jaques (with the appropriate symbols included). Not sure why that was, but i entered a different name and it took. Since then ive had no issues with the game (though do note, it appears to be in bad taste to punch your neighbor's ram. Learned that the hard way. Also, don't pick pockets, even if that comes up as a \"skill\" of yours. You'll subsequently get banned from the surrounding community).",

Especially when said things have rainbow color options. I have LED light strips on my desk and external monitor, a LED mousepad, a rainbow backlit external keyboard, and various lamps. At night, my office looks like a space ship.<br /><br />All of this is to say I was drawn to the Tilted Nation Gaming Laptop Stand because of the “visually striking aesthetics” of the lighting options.<br /><br />But when my laptop is on the stand, I can’t see the lighting effects! The sides of my laptop block any view of the lighting.<br /><br />And I have a 13” Macbook Pro, so a larger laptop will block even more. The only way I can see the lighting effects is if I look underneath my laptop.<br /><br />When I took the stand out of the box, one of the foam blocks meant to hold the laptop in place fell off. I stuck it back on, but naturally, that makes me worry about it falling off again and my laptop sliding off.<br /><br />The stand does have an extra piece that can be put in the front slot, for use with bigger laptops. It does impede using a touchpad but provides extra stability.<br /><br />The USB ports are really high on the back of the stand. If your laptop has a thick lid, the lid might cover or come very close to the ports. The stand is powered by USB-C, the box includes a USB-C to USB-C cable and a USB-C to USB-A cable to accommodate all laptops.<br /><br />Depending on where your laptop’s vents are, the top portion of the stand might block them. The top support is 2 inches wide.",

            "question": "title: Good construction. Terrible ergonomics.\ntext: I have mixed feelings about this keyboard. Note that I use it for typing, not gaming. On the plus side, it's heavy and has a solid feel. The layout is standard and the multimedia controls with the big knob for the volume are convenient.<br /><br />I'm so-so on the Cherry Brown switches. The key action takes some getting used to.The keys actually activate before you get to the &#34;click&#34; at the bottom of the stroke. So you can theoretically type lightly. But there is no tactile or auditory feedback at the activation point. So if you try to not push all the way down you may find that some key presses don't register. It takes more force than other keyboards to fully activate the keys, resulting in finger fatigue.<br /><br />But the biggest problem is that the keyboard has terrible ergonomics. Many modern keyboards have a layout that angles at least slightly toward the outside to accommodate shoulder width so that your wrists stays straight. This keyboard is completely straight. And although the keys and the width of the keyboard look standard, the shape of the key caps or something else I can't figure out makes this keyboard feel very small and constrained. I have to keep my arms tight at my side in an awkward position to type on it. Otherwise, my wrists are bent so far that I get pain almost immediately when I use it.  This keyboard is also taller than many keyboards. Which means unless you enjoy carpal tunnel, it desperately needs a wrist support. (Really, you charge well over $150 for a keyboard and you can't provide a wrist support?)<br /><br />Honestly, I make more typing mistakes on this keyboard than any other keyboard I've ever used. I keep thinking I'll get used to it. But I've had it for a couple of months and it's still uncomfortable to me. I have a wrist pad on order. I hope that will help. The construction quality is good. But it doesn't really make up for poor design. Because I liked the qualify feel and thought I might get used to the design, I missed the return window. So I'm stuck with it. But if I had it to do over, I wouldn't buy it--particularly at the premium price compared to other keyboards.",

            "question": "title: Decent game - 3 stars\ntext: This is a decent game -- not great, but ok. 3 stars.  Here's why:  First of all, some of the screens are pretty dark.  I know they do this so you'll use the thermal imaging and x-ray vision (both pretty cool), but it takes away from the gameplay, in my opinion, when you can't see the whole screen.  Secondly, I'm using my Sureshot Rifle, so take this in stride, but pushing the C and Z buttons is a little cumbersome, but not too terrible.  I'm going to try this with the WiiZapper, and if it's a lot better, I'll post that on here.  I really think it will be about the same...  The power-up special weapons are a little difficult to use, too.  By comparison, they're much easier to use on my Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2011 or Remington Grand Slam North America (two excellent games) than this game, but still usable.  It was pretty fun game what I've played so far, but didn't put me on the edge of my seat like the 2 games I mentioned above.  It's an ok buy, tho, for $20.",

            "question": "title: Difficult for newbies, great graphics and storyline\ntext: First thing - this game is really difficult for newbies to the gaming world. As adults with our first game system, we purchased several games in different genres for our new Wii system. We bought one of the other Resident Evil titles and loved it, so this one seemed like a natural choice due to the rave reviews and the first person shooter perspective. I love the graphics here - it's very easy to get sucked into the world and the feel of the game without question. Especially if you have the opportunity to set it up on a Hi-Def large screen television - gorgeous.<br /><br /> However, this is a hard game! It's not a game for beginners unless you just enjoy frustration and shrieking at the tv and starting over again and again and again. The little tricks and subtle ins and outs that long time gamers all pick up as they play game after game after game hours on end seem to be needed and assumed for Resident Evil 4. That in and of itself is not a dealbreaker, just something I wish I had known ahead of time - I would have waited and purchased this game later on. What ended up happening is we got frustrated and stuck at the first village, stopped playing the game for a couple of months, conquered some others, learned some gaming tricks in general and have now come back to Resident Evil 4 with a fresh perspective and attitude and we're enjoying it much more the second time around. So.... not a game a for first timers, but one worth playing when you've gotten your feet wet elsewhere first.",

One of the most glaring problems is the ear covers. They are just too small...and round. How many people do you know with ROUND ears? Most ears are oval in shape. I think my ears are pretty normal size, but they don't quite fit in the ear cushions. It is very uncomfortable.<br /><br />I tried using the headset with my xBox One in a chat group with my friends. At one point they were having trouble hearing me. There are only two sound controls, the mute switch (which works fine), and a volume control. I thought the volume control was to control the level of sound I was hearing in the earphones. Apparently, it controls my voice to the group, because my friends were having trouble hearing me until I tinkered with the volume control. When I turned it up, they could hear me better. That was a little confusing.<br /><br />In the end, I took this headset off and went back to using my Turtle Beach headset. I don't recommend this headset.",

The two different brightness options (tap the button twice quickly to change) are almost identical. It is powered by an included micro USB cable. The cable is about 70 inches long.<br /><br />The LED stripe around the edge of the mouse pad is flexible, so the mouse pad can be rolled up for easy storage.<br /><br />I’ve taken off a star because the mouse pad has a *very* strong rubber scent.

But now that he's starting fifth grade, his parents decide that it's time for him to venture outside his little world and go to school -- regular school -- where he'll have to deal with a whole lot of new people. That would be a challenge for any kid, but it's especially challenging for Auggie, whose face is not like other kids' faces.<br /><br />But this isn't a depressing, \"kids-with-issues\" book. In fact what struck me about it was how much Auggie's struggles are like other kids' struggles. His specific situation gives him difficulties that most other kids don't have to deal with. But he deals with them pretty much the way any kid would -- or maybe a little better. The story is told first from Auggie's point of view, then from his sister's and other characters', so we see the impact of Auggie's facial deformity on others around him as well. The book reminded me of the best of Judy Blume, with its realistic characters of various ages. But it's maybe a tad more optimistic about human nature.

I was getting constant feedback that I sounded distant or muffled no matter what settings I changed. Issues were present on PC and PS4 so I can't blame settings on one or the other. The cool gel was pretty much pointless. You can feel the cooling affect for a minute or two when first using, but after that they felt just as warm if not warmer than other headphones. The so called \"DAC\" that is included is not a true DAC and I couldn't get any noticeable difference on the PC when playing with the settings. I wasn't expecting audiophile quality in the price range but I have other headphones that sound much better in this price range so in my opinion, these are not worth the price.",

A little on the expensive side I paid the $170 for Rapidfire\ntext: Update July 2019: I've owned the keyboard a little over 3 years. Customer support hasn't answered and it's been almost a week so I am dropping the review to 2 stars. That and because it is malfunctioning. I had a ticket in with support and their suggestion was to plug it into another computer, which I didn't have at the time so the issue was never resolved. Now I have tried the keyboard in multiple other computers, and the keys send multiple signals when I press them. Hit E once, anywhere from 2 - 10 E's show up, same with almost every key. So typing is a nightmare I'm constantly using backspace. Typing passwords is almost impossible. I do LOVE a mechanical keyboard but having a 2 year warranty, and after paying $170 for your keyboard, watch it die in 3 years sucks. I did order a renewed K70 keyboard from the corsair outlet for $70, because these keyboards are fantastic once you get used them. And I couldn't really go to another brand since I've invested in the corsair mouse, and corsair pad. The CUE to make the RGB colors schemed is also fantastic. The K95 Platinum is the expensive keyboard from them right now, Rapidfire was pretty new when I got it, I'm switching to the LUX for a quieter key click.<br /><br />UPDATE: Putting the stars back to 4 stars, this keyboard keeps pretty clean, I did have to buy a can of air to shoot some cat hair out ( I could have just pulled a couple keys with the key puller they sent... ) this review is going back to 4 stars because the RGB lighting is cooler than cool, it's ice cold! Thanks to my new graphics card also having RGB I'm rocking a sick red white blue setup between my gear... Keyboard the american flag, mouse white, headphones red, front case fan blue, graphics card red and white...  All red is a little intense for me, but most my friends seem to like it the best. Sadly I use an Xbox 360 controller for most of my gaming right now.<br /><br />UPDATE: Amazon Prime day July 12 2017, I've had this keyboard about a month, new rapidfire switches, I paid like $180, today it is $109. I wish I waited until now....<br /><br />UPDATE to the UPDATE: The keyboard is nice, and being able to change the colors is cool, I don't have another keyboard with switches so I don't know if these rapidfire switches are that much better than regular MX cherry reds, I wish I saved the $100 and got a regular mechanical keyboard and used money towards a new video card.<br /><br />UPDATE: After 12 hours of intensive gaming, I love this keyboard even if I need to get used to how sensitive the keys are... I find myself strafing left because my finger is resting too hard on the A key (I'm used to holding it halfway down to get a fast strafe). I am in the processes of ordering a replacement, my volume adjustment makes a horrible squeal when adjusting volume down (sounds like nails on a chalk board). I am leaving this at 4 out of 5 stars because my extra keys do not include 1-6, I received the key puller WASD in the top half of the package, then keys, Q,W,E,R,D,F. Not my most used keys, my W&S keys definitely get worn off the fastest since I run mostly FPS games, then the number keys wear out.<br /><br />This is only getting 4 out of 5 stars. Pros, fast key response, cool lights. Cons, expensive, keys are too close together (I used to have a partial key next to the A, so I didn't just bump capslock. Also F11 & F12 are really close to the backspace), software is horrible to learn.<br /><br />My keyboard plugged in and looked badass to start, all red with white letters for WASD and my arrow keys on the right, after installing the software it started doing a crazy rainbow spiral. After halfway through a 40minute youtube video I got the Default lightning profile back to red with white (I wanted blue... to match my mouse). I can't even get the other K70 profiles on corsairs website to work. I downloaded a couple profiles to check them out, figured out how to import them into the right category, and they just blackout the keyboard like it doesn't have lights.",

Great price for under$20 and I bought it for a total of $8 (roundabout) if it breaks anytime soon I will buy another because of the cheap price and the quality you get out of that price, even with a new one of these every 6 months or to a year just to have that new mouse feel without breaking the bank at all.

            "question": "title: Top-notch sequel in \"Escape From Monkey Island\"\ntext: \"Escape from Monkey Island\" is the fourth game in the \"Monkey Island\" series, which follow the adventures of wannabe pirate Guybrush Threepwood and the love of his life, Governor Elaine Marley, as they battle against the evil undead pirate Chuck LeChuck (who just won't stay dead after three games). In \"Escape from Monkey Island\" Guybrush returns from his honeymoon with Elaine to find out that they have been declared dead. Now he must investigate a slimy Australian developer who is buying up all of the Tri-Island area and \"reforming\" the pirates into docile citizens. In the meantime Elaine is running for governor against Charles L. Charles, a suspiciously familiar face. Once again Guybrush gets to rescue the damsel in distress, fight monkeys in Monkey Kombat (a hilarious Mortal Kombat spoof you have to see to believe), and test his wit at Insult Arm Wrestling, as well as downing Groggoccinos from Starbuccaneers and visiting his own theme restaurant Planet Threepwood (sound familiar?), all while trying to find a powerful Voodoo charm, the Ultimate Insult, before the bad guys do.<br />\"EFMI\" is the first game to feature 3D characters, and all of the familiar faces (Guybrush, Elaine, Carla, Otis, Herman) translate well to their new medium. The game's engine is basically an upgraded Grim Fandango GRIME system, but the graphics are gorgeous (and eccentric: the familiar swirly clouds, watercolour stars, nifty maps and gaudy costumes look great). The music is a mysterious blend of Caribbean and sweeping scores worthy of John Williams (steel drums, rowdy pirate music, Muzak in Starbuccaneers and Jambalaya Island (the same theme changes to a minor key once you visit Nuttin Atoll, nice touch) string-driven themes). The voice acting is superb, with Dominic Armato returning as Guybrush, Charity James as Elaine, Earl Boen as LeChuck, Tom Kane (Darwin on \"The Wild Thornberries\"), and Nick Tate as Ozzie. The dialogue is as sharp as any of the previous games (I loved listening to Ozzie Mandrill spouting Australian insults and throwing around Aussie slang at every opportunity), and the storyline is always a surprise. I had a few small technical problems even after installing the patch, but I found workarounds, and other than that the game ran great (it does require 3D acceleration, however). A pleasure from beginning to end, I only hope that there will be more \"Monkey Islands\" in the future!",

The gameplay is terrible, the interface confusing and the way the Sims themselves are drawn is ridiculous. Why do they all look alike no matter how many different families you have? And worst of all must be the glitches this game has- I lost entire generations of families because the game froze as it was saving and I had to exit out. Sims 2 was the best and any version beyond is just going downhill. If you play Sims 2 please stick with it.",

The sensitivity options and side buttons are must haves for a gaming mouse. But it has a few problems. The mouse wheel sometimes activates with side pressure, which can be disastrous in an intense game but it's otherwise not a big deal. Right click seems to fail about once every 100-200 clicks, but this might be hand size related. I don't recommend it if you have large hands (I'm six feet tall, average tall person hands). There's not quite enough room for all my fingers, so my pinky is kind of splayed out and my middle finger doesn't line up perfectly with the right mouse button. There other large hands issue is the buttons are inset, with a rim of housing along the front. Sometimes i accidentally press on that bit of housing instead of the button, which fails to click. Not an issue if you claw grip your mouse, but otherwise problematic. For office and non-competitive gaming, is a good semi-budget option. For esports or the large handed, I'd get something else.",

As you investigate each character you'll find out if they have an alibi or not.  At the end of the game, you solve a final puzzle to determine which of the five is guilty.

No spoilers here, but I'm in the third chapter now. Now sure how big overall the game is.  There are tons of improvements to the original which makes it a worthwhile investment. Even if you've never played Dragon Quest Builders 1, or the mainline franchise, if you like crafting and building, this is a great game.<br /><br />I dock one star for a few issues:<br /><br />* Slow pacing. Like a traditional JRPG, this has TONS of dialog. Most of the dialog is easy to step thru by just mashing the A button, but there are some story-centric scenes which cannot be skipped and just take forever to wait out.<br />* Very small UI scale. In handheld mode, it can make it a squint-fest and there is no way to increase the font or stuff.<br />* I haven't unlocked free-play mode. I guess just like the original, you have to finish the game first. That might be a turnoff to some people who just want to be creative. There is a built-in social media network where you can share screenies and some of those are AMAZING, I just wish we could get there sooner.<br />* Frame rating issues. Generally the game runs smoothly, but I've had one boss battle which was fairly involved, NPCs running all over the place, monsters popping up, and the boss itself hurling attacks, and it really hammered the Switch's performance.<br /><br />Issues aside, it's a great game and no regrets.<br /><br />Who else named their slime Rimuru?",

            "question": "title: Consider this before buying a PS2 within the next 2 months\ntext: The Playstation 2 is, without a doubt, one of the best video game systems of all time. It has such a diverse library of games that you are bound to find something to apease everybody. So why am I giving it 4 stars instead of 5?<br /><br />There are two factors about the current PS2 design that you won't find anywhere on the box. The first is reliability/quality of design. My first PS2 broke 2 weeks after I bought it. It started making a quiet rattling noise while the games were playing, so I would check the games when I heard the noise and they would be fine... well one day they weren't fine. In fact, Blockbuster wasn't amused when I told them my PS2 lacerated the bottom of their disc like a Cat from Pet Cemetary. That's one experience right?<br /><br />My friend is on her 3rd PS2 (keep in mind the PS2 has only been out for about 4 to 5 years). Another couple I know is experiencing their first problem with their PS2 2 years after they bought it. It won't play any discs that are black on the back (Almost all PSone discs, and a lot of early PS2 discs).<br /><br />A lot of people will tell you that the PS2 only has problems if you stand it upright (which Sony says is perfectly fine and even sells a stand for). That would be inconsistent with my experience because mine still malfunctioned and it was sitting horizontally. I even have a horizontal stand which is supposed to increse airflow (the  horizontal stand made by Sony). Also, the friend I mentioned who is on her third PS2 console has never stood her's upright.<br /><br />I'm not saying that every PS2 is going to up and die on you, but I think all consumers should be aware that the PS2 has reliability issues, and a quick browse through these reviews will confirm that. It doesn't mean it isn't still an awesome system!<br /><br />The next thing you will want to consider is whether or not you want THIS model of PS2. You may have read lately that the PS2 got a major overhaul unveiled at the Tokyo Game Show. Well, that revised version of the PS2 will be available in the US on Nov. 1st 04 according to Sony. In my opinion, they may be responding to the quality problem with this new system... but that is speculation and really doesn't belong in a review so scratch that from the record books. The difference between the new and old version is sheer mass. In all ways the new design is much smaller. It can also be stood upright. It is some 75% smaller and 50% lighter. You can see it on Playstation.com. It will also be 150 bucks, no price difference. It looks a lot more solid. HOWEVER!!! If you plan on playing Final Fantasy XI get the current design before it is gone. So far the redesigned PS2 doesn't support the HDD Hard Drive necessary to play FFXI and Sony hasn't expressed any plans for that. So, the question becomes do you want the classic design or the updated version that hits in Nov. Me? I can't really wait until Nov. because MK Deception comes out in a few weeks hehehehe.<br /><br />A word about accessories. As I mentioned before I have a horizontal stand for my PS2. The horizontal stand is supposed to increse airflow. Supposedly, this does good things for the system. The stand is worthless. It doesn't really connect to the system, the system just sits on top of it. It's kinda cool looking... other than that you  should be aware that neither the horizontal or vertical stands are necessary because the system is designed so that it can stand or sit without a stand. The vertical stand adds a little extra balance but I recommend you never put your system on carpet or an uneven surface. The carpet causes static issues and, like uneven surfaces, can result in the system falling if shaken too hard (take note parents of energetic kids). The PS2 already has quality issues, don't give it any additional trauma to help the process along.<br /><br />Third party controllers (Controllers made by a company other than Sony) just aren't as good as factory controllers. Plain and simple. They all have cool little features and they are getting better, but stick to the controllers made by Sony and avoid the headache of unresponsive controls. This is, of course, unless you absolutely need a wireless controller so people aren't tripping when they walk by, or if your hands (or your little gamer's hands) are too small for a standard controller, there are \"mini\" controllers available.<br /><br />As far as online game play goes, the PS2 leads the pack for play features while the Xbox leads the pack for... instant messaging and lan party-esque mass multi-player gaming. Sometimes the Xbox is a little more like a computer that I approve of. NOTE- if you want to play online you need to make sure the PS2 you are buying comes with the online adapter (or if you wait till Nov. for the redesign it will be intergrated). If you don't have highspeed internet, don't worry! According to Sony 40% of it's online market is tapping online gaming with dial-up. Dial-up is an option if you have an online adapter.<br /><br />That's about it. Hope this was helpful. PS2 Rocks!",

            "question": "title: Performance depends on your system\ntext: When I got this I was a bit disappointed. Kiddo has an entry level gaming laptop (he's almost 8, entry is about all I trust him with right now) that gets full rather easy and the biggest space hog is his Steam library. I was hoping this would be a quick fix to moving the games off his laptop without a loss of performance. But moving the games took FOREVER and he kept knocking the external SSD around on his small desk. It also gets a bit warm when taxing it, so I called it a fail, and just ended up upgrading his internal M.2 SSD instead.<br /><br />Since I was stuck with this thing, I decided I would use it as a temporary drive for my desktop. I needed to replace my rather old internal HDD and I didn't want to crowd my second smaller drive. My system is quite a bit better than the kids, with a newer i-7 Intel processor and a freshly installed vid card (GeForce RTX 2080 Super). This made all the difference, the file transfers zipped along including my Steam library. I was able to play games directly from the drive without a noticeable drop in performance, although I play things like Rimworld and Terraria, so I may not tax it as much as some of the more graphic heavy games out there. I was scared to test Ark, that poorly optimized game likes to crash my entire system... @#$%.<br /><br />I did eventually put everything back onto an internal drive, I like having this though as a nice back up and quick way to transfer items. Some things like tax and other important documents I left a copy on the drive. Just in case my system blows up or has a major melt down.<br /><br />TL;DR<br />This SSD Drive's performance is very dependent on your system. Which is going to be true of all similar products.",

            "question": "title: True to the Films is Priority #1\ntext: When it comes to making a horror videogame, atmosphere comes as a much higher priority than gameplay mechanics. This may be the reason you might've seen a few game critics being tough on SAW. Game reviewers are often looking for revolutionary game mechanics, new gameplay ideas, and a truckload of hyperbole from magazines and websites to score their games highly. But just like every SAW film, it's videogame cousin stands for much more than meets the eye, and doesn't need to defy conventions to be true to the source material.<br /><br />In fact, SAW does not fight against any conventions at all. Mostly every aspect of the game is familar to horror game veterans: Dark, moody graphics, low lighting, first-person controls, third-person view, grimy and rusted environments, dark musical score, particularly gruesome etc. Combat controls are fairly basic and often sluggish, but get the job done nonetheless.<br /><br />There are tons of exploring possibilities, and true to the films, these environments look fairly similar to one another. Puzzle solving is key in SAW: Levels consist of lots of puzzles; some basic, some more complicated, and a few are very clever. There are several puzzles in each level, so exploration and puzzle solving are more prominent than action-heavy combat. You may encounter only a few enemies in each level; all of them playing their own \"game\" to stay alive.<br /><br />Each level ends in your character trying to free another from one of Jigsaw's many death devices; SAW's version of a boss fight. These puzzles are usually more perplexing, and may take a few tries to complete, but none of these puzzles are impossible.<br /><br />What SAW gets particulary right is its atmosphere. The ambience from the films are nailed in this game version, and will immediately immerse you in the SAW universe. Several characters from the films make an appearance in an all-new storyline, and one voice in particular will be instantly familiar. Little things like this add up to a lot when making a licensed game.<br /><br />If you like horror games and the SAW films, you'll be very pleased with the finished product. It doesn't have the production values or extra polish of what are considered to be top-tier games, and certainly doesn't introduce anything incredibly new. But the atmosphere alone is worth the price of admission, especially if you are more interested in using your brain than your trigger finger. Be aware that you'll likely need to be a fan of the SAW films to completely enjoy this title, but if you are, it's fan service at its finest.",

This makes opening webpages in a new tab frustrating, and the middle mouse click binds in my games seriously affect game play.<br /><br />The mouse overall is nice, I wish it didn't have all these problems with the wheel, but it seems that this is an ongoing issue with Steelseries Sensei mice and they haven't addressed it.

That said, the goals are challenging without being impossible, and this game offers quite a lot of gameplay for your dollar.  This is not a game to be finished in one sitting.  Overall I found it to be quite similar to Ranch Rush.  If farm games are not a passion for you, then owning one or the other may very well be sufficient.

I'd hate to add up all those hours....<br />This game controls well....I used a wired controller and played on the tv.  You cant reconfigure buttons or use gamecube controllers.  It wont take long to get used to it though.<br />Colors are vivid, tracks are good and good length.  They also are not too wide or too narrow. But the magic of course is the characters!  I was quick to unlock Heffer because he is my favorite.  In this game you also unlock crew members and chiefs.  They actually let you customize the gameplay....Muddy Mudskipper lets you go through slime really fast.  You get to make different combos to make a really unique ride.  I dont know how many combinations there are but its a LOT.  Different ones can do things such as act as a magnet to suck up coins, add extra boosts, extra items, etc.  This alone should keep the game fresh and fun for a long time.<br /><br />The cars do feel different.  You can change the wheels, engine and tail pipes to change vehicle stats such as speed, drift, handling, etc.  Parts are unlocked to be bought with your coins collected and won.  You can really change up the looks of a vehicle with paint schemes and they arent limited to specific characters so Spongebob can have Ninja Turtle paint on his vehicle.  I dont think weight matters like it does in MK.<br /><br />I ran through the cups in medium, all manual control in about 4 hours, taking short breaks, placing first fairly easily.  The credits roll when you place 1st in all cups in any speed.  But parents, dont let a kid fool you and say they beat the game and are done with it if the credits roll....I have also done several challanges and a boss \"fight\" and have only unlocked or accomplished 18% of the game on about 5.5 total hours playtime.<br /><br />Theres a battle arena that would be awesome with other players in the room but you can play it alone.<br /><br />So...is it as polished as MK?  No.  The music is lacking....i would like to have had show theme songs.  Sound effects are great....slime sounds slimey!  The game looks fine--really good most of the time.  I did experience some disappointing lag at times and they need to patch that.  Its bad when it happens and theres no excuse for it. Thats the only gripe i have.<br /><br />I think this is good for fans of kart racing games, its not perfect but its similar to MK but ....I think its 28 different tracks and even though thats a lot less than MK, its unique tracks make it a decent game.  I cant attest to online play....i tried several times and didnt get a match....in other words, no one to race.  Of course, this game just came out though.<br />This is a good game for kids, a family or people like me who love the older Nick chatacters and Spongebob.  There are newer characters as well.  Its FUN and thers a lot of humor in the pit crew items.  Fun--That is the most important to me.<br /><br />Easy 8 out of 10",

I started out on the first gallery, and within a very short time had 3 more galleries unlocked.  OK, so my hand did get a little sore from pulling the trigger and pumping the pump, but it's well worth the inconvenience.  As an avid hunter, I might have an advantage over someone who has never hunted, but I think anyone with decent motor skills could pick it up and be successful pretty quickly.  Once you get used to the controls, this game is SO addictive and so fun.  I would pay $35 just for the first 4 levels.  I priced the arcade version of Big Buck Hunter, and it's $5000 for the standup game!  It does get pretty hard at Gallery 4, and that's as far as I've gotten.  I didn't even play the campaign at all last nite--just the galleries.  If you've got an itchy trigger finger, this game is for you.  There are tons of critters to shoot, and you only have to switch back and forth between a rifle and a shotgun, pull the trigger and reload your 3-shot rifle or double-barrelled shotgun.  The power-ups are great--slow motion, unlimited ammo, 2x points, marksman (thermal imaging kinda), and health are all really cool.  This game tells you at the end (assuming you stay alive) of each gallery how many critters you shot, how many bonuses you got, and what your accuracy was.  The action and graphics and sound are all very good.  I think the game writers intentionally made the geese that fly up and over hard to see against the backgrounds in order to make it more challenging to shoot the geese--just like real life goose hunting.  The nunchuck is a little bit tricky getting into the gun (the cord from the nunchuck to the front controller specifically), but once you get it in there, it is very secure, and I didn't have any problems at all.  I haven't played a better shooter hunting game for the money.  If anyone knows of a better big game shooter than this game, please let me know.",

If you're a MJ fan, then this is the perfect game for you.  I danced, I sang, then I danced some more.  Interesting enough it wasn't hard to follow the moves from the pictograms or even MJ himself because they depicted his signature moves.  I'm totally in love with this game.<br /><br />Now for the bad... unlocking training videos, really?  Training and warm/up videos should have been a feature that is available to the user before they begin attempting the dance moves and not something that the user gets after he has attempted the dance moves.  The next thing that I found annoying was that I had to enter my name each time I completed a song.  I should have been assigned a avatar/user at the beginning of the game to eliminate this need.<br /><br />Overall, BIG FUN!!!  But, I couldn't in good conscience give this game the full five stars because of the problems with game usability.

Thus I tried this, which uses the tried and true (and OEM) method of charging.  Not only did this work well with the included batteries, my other two controllers (with the Nyko batteries) can now charge for real too!  Battery life seems to be a tad less than advertised, but the cells in the batteries may be a little old (mine was new, but unsure when they were made).  As with other 360 accessories, it's hard to tell what's new and whats 2010 overstocks!  Anyway, these really do work, and among the current choices, seem to be the best.

            "question": "title: Great addition to the Xeno games\ntext: So I'm going to say right away that i'm a big fan of the Xenogames in general. It's the reason I decided now was the time to buy a switch, I'm also 100+ hours in.<br /><br />That said I love this game, it feels like the xenoblade games before it but the combat does feel improved now that you no longer have to cycle through arts since they are now assigned to face buttons. The chain combos add a very satisfying feel to the combat as well.<br /><br />A lot of complaints I read was that the combat takes too long, at first I agreed but when you use the combo chains effectively things feel pretty standard for a xenoblade battle.<br /><br />The complaints of the map is all true, even with updates it's pretty easy to just be totally lost due to elevations mostly. If they add the follow guide thing from Xenoblade chronicles X then everything would be fine.<br /><br />Another issue i saw people having was the high level beasts roaming around. I'm probably just used to it from xenoblade chronicles x because it doesn't bother me at all. Like X you learn your place in the food chain and almost like hungry shark, as you level up the usually aggressive beasts become humble no longer attacking unless provoked, this makes fetching stuff in previously visited locations easy.<br /><br />I seem to always be a bit overpowered though so I tend to be able to stroll through new and expected dangerous areas without having to fight which makes things a little boring<br /><br />Without spoilers, the story is great. In some ways I like it more than the xenoblade 1, X is different for me as it reminds me more of xenogears and xenosaga but its usually consider the weakest story-wise.<br /><br />Obtaining the rare blades can be a pain though, 100 hours in and it looks like I'm still missing about half, perhaps they are mostly special story related/ quests ones.<br /><br />Overall great for any fan of the series and new players as well, you don't have to play the others before it.",

            "question": "title: Challenging and Fun\ntext: I was a little nervous when I ordered this game. I wanted something fun, something that would get my heart rate up, and maybe even teach me some dance moves, but I'll be perfectly honest -- I'm out of shape and I have no rhythm. This is why I don't dance publically but love the wii -- an opportunity to embarrass myself in the privacy of my living room to my heart's content and nobody knows it but me. I have a short attention span, so have long since grown bored of Wii Fit, DDR, Wii Cheer, and a couple of other exercise programs barely worthy of mention.<br /><br />Why was I nervous? Quite simply, because a few reviewers reported that this game wasn't for people who didn't already know how to dance. For that reason, I had this in my shopping cart for a month before I cliked \"buy\". Too bad I didn't get over my wariness sooner.<br /><br />To the naysayers: I see your point. This is not an easy game or an easy workout. There aren't easy on-screen guides with 4 possible places to stomp your foot. With a wii mote in each hand and your feet on the floor, you are expected to follow all manner of footwork from the basic to the complex. The tutorials works like this: slowly, feet only, for 3 moves, then slowly, hands and feet, for 3 moves, then normal speed. Wait! I wasn't ready. Rewind! Yes, I definitely felt that way the first few times I went through the routine.<br /><br />But I wasn't looking for easy. Did I really expect, with my flabby thighs and embarassing upper arms, that I would smoothly glide into salsa moves in an afternoon? No! I expected to have to work for it, and that is precisely what I have been doing for the past 2 weeks.<br /><br />It is worth noting, to those who can't keep up with the routines, that at the end of every routine you have the option of going back into the routine to work on indidividual moves. This option sends you back into the workout video and allows you to play a small segment in a loop, over and over again, until you decide you're done with it. Three slow moves not enough? Just go back into the turoial and repeat to your heart's content. It took me a few days to realize that I had this option, so I wanted to make sure to mention it.<br /><br />That said, the game does do a pretty poor job of helping you figure out what move to do next. This is particularly true during the cardio boxing routines, where they tell you how to punch as they are throwing it. Um, two second's notice, please? That's one of the reasons I knocked off a star, but before I get ahead of myself, let me just do the pros and cons:<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />*A great workout<br />*Fun latin dance moves<br />*Fun cardio moves<br />*Entertaining workout games such as dodging bulls<br />*A personal trainer to help you choose daily workout programs that gradually step you up from trainee to pro<br />*Good music<br />*Practice mode that allows you to select any part of a workout to retry over and over again, until you get it right<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />*Some difficulty following the moves, especially in cardio boxing<br />*Only 20 songs<br />*The way this game determines calorie burn has to do with how many correct moves it detects from your wii mote, which means that if you are only using one remote (such as in 2 player mode), it counts about half the calories burned as if you're using both remotes.<br /><br />I recommend this game if you want a fun workout, even if you aren't in great shape. If you're a lumpy couch potato, you might want to start with Wii Fit and try this when the cardio in that game fails to challenge you (which won't take long), but if you're determined and up for a challenge, there's no reason that this can't be the right game for you. I've only had the game for 2 weeks, so it's hard to know what kind of staying power it will have, but I have a short attention span...anything I stick with for 2-3 months is a good purchase for me, and I'm definitely not even close to being done with this one.",

We ended up sending her a few pictures of what was going on with the controller and she sent out another one immediately, without question.  So far GameSir has been one of the best, if not THE best, company we have dealt with in terms of customer service, and the quality of their products is second to none.

            "question": "title: First impressions are GREAT!\ntext: It's just my first impression since I have only been able to play for a couple days so far, but I definitely think it's the next big MMO. I've played more MMORPGs than I can count (FFXI, FFXIV, WoW, GW2, Aion, AIKA, MapleStory, Neverwinter, RIFT, Tera, LotR, etc.) so perhaps I'm just biased for the genre, but I am loving it!<br /><br />I really appreciate the path system combined with the class system to give you a few options for playstyle as you progress through the game. Just pick a path that suits your style (soldier path for those who love to kill things and explorer path for those who like to find hidden areas - my fave). I've started 8 characters to get a feel for the different options and figure out what kind of character I really want to be, so I have a good grasp of the basics by now. I definitely prefer the explorer path, but I've tried them all. Settler is pretty awesome for the buffs too. Scientist was a lot of extra work, but I do miss it when I see a hidden door only a scientist can open! Soldier is not for me, I don't like to just kill endlessly, but some people do so that's the path for them!<br /><br />I love the playstyle too, because you can choose your class based upon what kind of fighting you want to do and I don't feel like playing a button-masher so I am steering clear of the warrior and the spellslinger for now, but I really like my esper for some unique hybrid options as I level her.<br /><br />My favorite aspect of the game so far would have to be the movement style (I love the double jumps as well as special items/areas that allow you to jump so high you're flying). It reminds me of the old Crash Bandicoot games in that sense and I do love to jump around hehe.<br /><br />For my personal playstyle I really love the explorer path. Pretty much every RPG has inspired the urge to explore, but this game truly rewards you for it and caters to that kind of player in more than just an easter egg or hidden treasure kind-of-way. The explorer path opens up new quests in every zone for someone with just my sensibilities. It's so fun to be shrunken down to explore a hidden cave like Alice in Wonderland or find a way to open up a glowing path in the sky or to weave your way through the tree vines and up to the very top. These are the kinds of things I would do anyway, just to find a useless deadend that the programmers created for fun. Now that secret path actually has a purpose if you choose explorer.<br /><br />I also love the AMP/skill tree kind of thing (always loved that setup in the old Final Fantasy games) so every character you level can be unique even if you choose the same exact race/class/path combo! I love that sort of flexibility that allows me to play how I want to and allows me to change the way my class works later if I realize I need different abilities for pvp or something.<br /><br />The humor and cartoon style kinda lean Sam and Max for any fans of that old series and that's one of my favorite things so far if you actually take the time to read the stuff in the game lol (though nothing will ever truly compare to Sam and Max, Wildstar is the only MMO I've ever played that had even a little bit of that flavor). &#60;3<br /><br />I'm really looking forward to customizing my house and getting mounts later. That always adds more fun to any game. Wildstar looks like they really outdid themselves in those areas as well and I haven't even got to that stuff yet! I've been busy having fun creating characters and figuring everything out. Now I think I have a character I want to level as a main and I can get into the meat of all that soon!  :)<br /><br />Anyway, just wanted to share my initial impressions since a lot of people are considering this title.

The design is very well-thought out. I love the fact that you can remove the mic when you don't want to use it and the inline sound is a very nice touch. We both agree that the sound quality is great.<br /><br />These are actually nice headphones for gamers.<br /><br />The only problem that I can see is that while hubs says that they are seriously comfortable on him but for me? Alas, they are just too damned big. Even with the smallest adapters, my ears are sore from just 30 minutes of use.<br /><br />Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not returning them or even upset because the hubs is getting a lot of use out of them, but unfortunately, because they aren't truly universal, I just can't give them all 5 stars either and really, that is the only reason: they just aren't universal.<br /><br />Still, even though this is a very common thing for us female gamers to encounter, I thought it was worth noting that was the ONLY reason for the lack of 5 stars as not all of us have husbands/brothers/guildies that they can give those headsets that are just too big for us.<br /><br />So, my conclusion is that these are really good if you have really big ears or are a guy.",

Apparently, Start the Party was not much of a game for them, It's as if they reviewed this with 16 year old Call of Duty fans in mind. Come on folks, lighten up and have some fun.<br /><br /> While Sports Champions is without a doubt the strongest launch title for the PS3 Move, there's no denying that Start the Party has plenty of charm and some kick-ass augmented reality effects. Matter of fact, it's the best \"show off\" game of the bunch. Yes, there are only so many mini games you will take part of before they get repeated, but there are difficulty settings and various modes to break things up. This is not the kind of game you lock yourself in a room with and play through out the night. You invite some friends/family in front of the large screen TV and laugh your butt off! I'm sorry, but watching yourself on live feed holding various in-game items is absolutely eye popping hilarious. The mini games are actually quite fun, and technically make any WarioWare micro game look fossilized. Both young and old will have a blast; the very young will be hypnotized by the visuals,  and teens will probably have fun but won't dare admit it (the sorry state of adolescent males).",

They use costar stabilizers, so you will need special inserts for the keycaps, which you cannot find on Amazon, only 2 sites in the US sell the inserts that I know of. The inserts that are already in the included keycaps feel like they are glued in, so you can't reuse them. Thankfully the stabilizers are snap ins on the board, so you can replace them pretty easily.

I wasn't expecting thumb depth to even be a thing.<br />— The clickable side is adjustable to a higher angle than any of my other vertical mouses.<br />— Thumb tilts in several directions, moves forwards and backwards (closer and further away from your palm), and it's possible to pull the thumb rest out further from the clicky side.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* It still feels really large for my hand.<br />— I can adjust to a good shape, but I feel like I barely have hold of it and it's going to slip out of my hand at any moment.<br />— Something about trying to grab it with my widdle hands means I often click accidentally when I don't want to and end up accidentally closing out windows. Oops!<br />— Also sometimes when I lose my grip on it, the thumb rest moves out of place. Maybe my hands are just too messed up to use mice any more. It's a real possibility.<br /><br />* It's not silent. I know it wasn't advertised as silent, but I have gotten used to silent mice, and kind of expect that now. So no false advertising or anything, but I prefer silent clicks.<br /><br />* I feel like it needs a skirt or some part protruding out the back for my hand to rest on. I don't like vertical mice with giant skirts, but a not toward a skirt might help me feel like I'm gripping it better.<br /><br />* What the heck even with the middle button. This is maybe a \"just me\" thing. But I'm not used to middle buttons, and I keep hitting the middle button when I want to right-click, and DISASTER. I tried to reprogram the buttons with X-Mouse button control, and it fixed it sure enough, but then it messed up all of my other mice. [Edit: I set both middle and right buttons to right-click, so no more problem there, I guess.]<br /><br />Oh yeah, time out: I have to alternate through a bunch of mice due to various RSIs, so having to reprogram buttons is no bueno for me. Also maybe a sign the mouse is too big for my hands.<br /><br />So I doubt I'll send it back and will keep it for arm pain flare-ups, but it's not worth $80 *to me*. The concept is gold, and with some tweaking and maybe actual different size options, the product itself could be outstanding.<br /><br />Maybe with more use I'll get used to it. Le sigh.",

            "question": "title: Hold off the Zerg Rush\ntext: I like this expansion and yet also hate this expansion.<br /><br />Overall, the new mechanics are well balanced.  You can now play pagans, and work with the limitations of the religion.  for the Norse, this means you can't avoid having each of your children inheriting and having to go to war or raiding every year or 2.  It makes for a lot of early conflict.<br /><br />The game does try to help at first, as the initial Norse counties have high levels of troops and a few pre-planned invasions.  This makes it easy to get some quick conquests in.<br /><br />Of course, that has a flip side.  If you are facing this onslaught  (Scotland, England, Ireland, Holland, etc.)  you end up facing 20-30 years of heavy conflict, and will likely lose quite a few provinces early.  And if you want to play as an independent count in any Norse region or one they are likely to attack expect to end up conquered because they will hit hard at first.<br /><br />But once their initial leaders start dying the kingdoms tend to come apart with internal conflicts.  So they really only have a major effect on the game for the first 50 years and then it does down a bit despite their need to keep raiding.  (by then its hard to raid from a single province and the fragmentation of their kingdoms means they don't have multiple provinces to use.)<br /><br />Good, but it basically just sets up a huge Zerg-rush at the start and then it settles down to the old game.",

I've never owned the G27, unfortunately, so it wouldn't be a fair comparison. I also don't own a PS4, so all on which I had to test this was a PS3. I don't own too many racing games compatible with this. Besides some demos, the only racing game I own in full is Gran Turismo 5 XL Edition.<br /><br />That said, this review will be based upon my limited resources, but I thought I'd give this review as an offering to those who may be in a similar position as me, and who still would like to consider purchasing this $400 driving wheel over others.<br /><br />Out of the box, this set looks gorgeous.

So, I did what any person does nowadays, I searched for reviews... and then I searched for more reviews and then more. Spoiler, reviews were shockingly limited unhelpful. So, here is a helpful review.<br /><br />1. quality - this charger feels solid and is easy to use; the controller fits on the dock easily, doesn't feel unstable or tippy. The led \"breathes\" to let you know it's charging and turns solid once charged. I've never struggled to connect the controller properly or fumbled with putting them on.<br /><br />2. charging time - I haven't timed it (sorry?) but it's fast and you can charge both at once or only one at a time.<br /><br />3. battery life - hours...  I can't say more or I'll sound even less like I have a life than I do now, but it's hours.<br /><br />4. battery covers - it comes with two one for the X and one for the Series X. They fit perfectly and they even look good on the blue controllers. The gap in the cover for the connection to the dock isn't too much. It's not too ugly and it doesn't interfere with use or plugging the controller in by usb-c.<br /><br />5. usb - here's my biggest complaint, the plug for the dock is not usb, so you must use the cable it comes with, you can't use another cable and have to have a wall plug nearby. It was fine for me, but if you're out of room on your power strip, you have my sympathies.<br /><br />6. battery - this one has the largest battery that I could find out of all the charging docks, so that's a plus.<br /><br />7. licensed - it's officially approved by Xbox, so I don't have to worry about it killing my $60 controllers.<br /><br />8. size - it's not tiny, but it doesn't take up unnecessary space, it isn't too tall or too long, pretty much perfect for storing / charging 2 controllers.<br /><br />9. color - it only comes in black, which is fine because it matches my Xbox, but if you wanted it in white or to match your controller, it's not going to happen.<br /><br />This is the charging dock to buy if you want to charge 2 controllers. It's easy to use, has a good battery life, doesn't take up too much space, quick charging, and looks cool. I appreciate the peace of mind of knowing Xbox was ok with it and the fact that I can store my controllers on it and not worry about where they are or if they've been charged lately.",

When I pre-ordered Book of Memories, I realized that it wouldn't be anything like the series.  I was actually grateful for the differences, as I am a fan of dungeon-crawlers in general.  For the most part, the graphics and music seem very \"Silent Hill'esque.\"  The more \"top-down-isometric view\" is a complete departure from what we're used to from the series, so you will not get the same feel as you would from the previous titles.<br /><br />**Combat**<br />Over all, I found the combat to be very fluid and easy to figure out.  I don't care much for the weapons breaking, but thus far, so many are available in each stage, you should be OK (though you might not be able to use your favorite one all the time.)<br /><br />**Story**<br />The story has only been OK so far.  A little convoluted, but I expected that.  The game play is why I'm here.<br /><br />**Game Play**<br />Classic dungeon-crawler!  Mash buttons when you see enemies.  Move out of the way when they swing at ya.  Some drop loot and of course you have limited inventory space (which is upgradable.)<br /><br />**Verdict**<br />Hardcore fans that want another entry in the Silent Hill series might be disappointed.  This is a game that uses themes and characters/monsters from the series, but feels almost nothing like any of it's predecessors.  The game is pretty good in it's own right.  I definitely recommend this to those who like hack-and-slash games (though this one has less loot) with puzzle-solving components.  Actually, this game seems a lot like Zelda without an overworld!",

The time limits are also very few and reasonable, so you're free to experiment with tons of synthesizing and exploring.<br /><br />The mini-game in applying materials on the grid has gotten more interesting. I can spend 15+ minutes trying to max out the effects on an item, and the interface makes it easy to change the board/materials after you select them all, so you don't have to cancel out and remember your choices every time you need to make a structural change to your grid.<br /><br />I enjoy the two protagonists a lot. They are sooo cute, and other than a few ugh plot moments, they really take a reasonable and proactive approach to most problems. &#34;Man, those other two people just need to be honest with each other and express themselves/communicate more clearly. Let's go make them do that.&#34; And they do. Yeay!<br /><br />The other alchemists/characters that join from previous games play a large role in your party and in the plot.

I took part in the Beta program, and although i can't get buy it (being out of USA & Canada), i can say it looks amazing.<br />Graphics are AMAZING, more colorful, accurate and yet the whole thing looks vaguely familiar.<br />Imagine the best classic sci-fi movie you love with today's CGI! Its like that.<br />I also own Spore, and unlike you guys think, the DRM does NOT prevent you from installing on same hardware.<br />I had to reinstall Spore because my other hard-drive went kaput, but i don't think i triggered the activation battle, because Windows was still the same, and same hardware.<br />The DRM clearly says i have 5 activations on DIFFERENT hardware.

So, I now have a single headphone, which is super awesome.  Amazon was gracious enough to give me a 20% refund while allowing me to keep this item, although it no longer fulfills its purpose.<br /><br />I contacted the company about their 1-year warranty period and, of course, I'm responsible for the shipping costs incurred in getting these things to the manufacturer's rep for repair.  The 20% refund is probably enough to cover the shipping one way as the nearest repair facility is nowhere convenient to my home.  So, you have a warranty, but you'd probably end up spending more in shipping to and from the facility than you would in just buying another set of these headphones.  Although, w/ the lackluster quality of the build I seem to have received, why would I bother buying another pair?",

It's beautiful I'll give them that and we do get a lot of stuff, but if you don't add actual gameplay then this is just another stuff pack and not an expansion.  Sims 1 and Sims 2 really focused on the relationships and interactions between the Sims with random things that were both adorable and made you care about your Sims.  When they died you grieved for them.  I very much miss picking your sims characteristics based on their sign.  You could really see their individual personalities.  In Sims 3 the focus was more task oriented and less relationships and honestly I didn't like Sims 3 at all but I can see why others did.  Now comes Sims 4 and I was excited because the graphics are stunning.  What a huge disappointment.  They took so much away that now we don't have a focus on anything.  Not on relationships nor on tasks.  Not to mention how they dumbed it down with emotions.  Seriously I really hate that and wish I could turn that off.  It completely takes the challenge away.  I had hoped EA and Maxis would have listened to the people but they aren't.  The game is horrible and I seriously don't see a Sims 5 in the future at this rate.  So very sad.",

            "question": "title: ~~FANTASTIC Keyboard~~ Well made, affordable, versatile, easy-to-read, great feedback, & perfect LED intensity to improve vision\ntext: This Azio Levetron is an awesome keyboard. Well made, affordable, and versatile, this keyboard is a good fit for many different tasks/needs.<br /><br />I do want to note on two things:<br />1) I am not a gamer so I cannot say exactly how well this keyboard works if purchased solely for the purpose of gaming. I purchased this keyboard for work and home usage. I did so because I like LED backlit keys as well as the feedback gaming keyboards provide.<br />2) I have only used this keyboard for a short period, and so I cannot speak to long-term reliability. I will update this review down the road to report back on how the keyboard holds up.<br />------------------------<br /><br />MY NEEDS & USAGE<br />I recently purchased a Dell IPS display so that I can run it as a secondary monitor next to my 15-inch MacBook Pro Retina, as this allows me to run Windows 8.1 via a virtual machine on the display, and OS X Yosemite on the MacBook’s display. As I use software that runs better on one OS over the other, this allows me to run whatever software does best in what OS. It also gives me easy access to legacy OS’ if I need to test something like code.<br /><br />I have apple’s wireless keyboard and think it is excellent. However, it favors mobility over performance. I find gaming keyboards tend to do the opposite…they are built for heavier usage, heavily favor accessibility and performance, and use features that make this possible (I own an unusually large amount of gaming gear.)<br />------------------------<br /><br />DESCRIPTION: THIS KEYBOARD<br />This keyboard is the Azio  Levetron L70, a wired, entry-level gaming keyboard that is LED backlit via blue colored LEDs. You can toggle these LEDs on and off, but you cannot change the color or the intensity.<br /><br />The layout of this keyboard is pretty standard, plus it has a massive volume knob and a switch dedicated specifically to turning the LEDs on and off. Each side of the keyboard has an LED light. The keys themselves used oversized letters, and these markings are clear so the LED light can shine through. A removable palm rest is included and the cord length is about 5 feet. The bottom features non-skid, non-marking rubber feet as well as retractable feet to increase the angle.<br /><br />I have used this keyboard with: OS X 10.10 Yosemite, OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, OS X 10.7 Lion, Windows XP SP3, and Windows 8.1 (current build as of 2015.) They keyboard works reliably on all of these, but note that this is technically a Windows keyboard and so with OS X you may want to use a keyboard control suite to modify some of the commands.<br /><br />The interface used is USB and it works on both USB 2 and USB 3 computers (can’t speak to USB 1.1 as I do not have computers that old anymore.) It does NOT seem to generate the harmonic distortion that some USB 3 devices can which can result in interference with 2.4 GHz signals.<br />------------------------<br /><br />WHAT I LIKE<br />The light intensity is perfect…bright enough to see when lights are on, but not so bright that it is an annoyance in darker environments. Another LED backlit keyboard I had was so faint that the LEDs did not really increase visibility.<br /><br />The lettering used is very large, making it easier to see and making it better display with the LEDs. If someone has trouble seeing most keys, this is an outstanding choice.<br /><br />Typing itself is comfortable, and I find the palm rest makes typing even more comfortable. Like many other gaming keyboards, you get more pronounced feedback than the standard free keyboard that comes with desktops. I strongly prefer this feedback when typing as I find I can type faster and with fewer errors. Also like many other gaming keyboards, I find that the physical force required to push a key and have it register is very, very consistent. With keyboard without this consistency, it is easy to subconsciously start pressing certain keys with more force than others, and this can result in more mistakes while typing (least for me anyway.)<br /><br />The cosmetic fit and finish of this keyboard is outstanding for the price. The numbers are neat, the patterns are sharp, there are no sharp spots from molding overspray, and the keyboard wire is quite beefy.<br /><br />So while I cannot speak directly to how well this works for gaming, I can say it is a great keyboard for general usage. It is also great for data visualization, which I suppose in some ways has similarities to gaming needs.<br />------------------------<br /><br />WHAT I DO NOT LIKE<br />At this price, I have zero dislikes with this keyboard.<br />------------------------<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br />Overall, this is a whole lot of keyboard for 20-25 bucks. It’s well made, it has fantastic visibility, it gives a very consistent typing experience, and its LEDs are perfectly balanced in intensity so that they contribute to better performance (rather than detracting from.)",

This was well worth the money.<br /><br />I love how many songs have videos, and I love the quirky song choices and the range of genres. There is Istanbul (Not Constantinople) by They Might be Giants, Rock Lobster by the B-52's (with a video), Alphabet Aerobics by Blackalicious (awesome, it speeds up as the song goes so by the end you are really skipping!), Sakura (the speed changes in this one really keep me challanged), Hey Mama by the Black Eyed Peas, and Nari Narien which is fun Indian-inspired techno. The difficulties are similar to DDR Max and Extreme titles - I usually play standard to heavy and I feel like there is a lot of room to grow into this game.<br /><br />My RedOctane Ignition pad with the included XBox connector works great with this game.

It has 5 thumb buttons that are easy to Identify by feel and the scroll wheel click right or left for additional key mapping. The scroll wheel has a very solid feel and doesn't spin freely. The mouse is pretty light but not the lightest. It is large though, about 5 1/2\" long, which is great for me. I also tend to drift back with my grip and this mouse has triggers in the front and the back of the right and left clickers. My other mouse would not register when I clicked to far back on the mouse, not with this one, I can press anywhere on the right and left clickers and it will register. The Nginuity software is not as well refined as other brands but does what it should. all of the functionality is there and is easy to set up. The best part about the HyperX Nginuity software is that it is not a resource hog. I've seen 200mb+ of RAM from other software for controlling a mouse while this is at about 40mb of RAM. Overall I am extremely happy with this mouse.",

Because they can also use a standard audio jack, they are also compatible with the PS4, Wii U, Vita, and 3DS.  There is an additional attachment to use them for your cell phone.<br /><br />The mouthpiece is detachable, which makes them great (albeit large) for regular headphones.<br /><br />These are powerfully noise cancelling, immersing you fully in the game experience.  The sound quality is outstanding.  They have tremendous range and seem to have some sort of built in leveling feature.  If your teammate says something just as there is an explosion, the game volume reduces, the chat volume increases, and you can hear both no problem.  If two players are talking, one softly, one loudly, it adjusts so that one doesn't drown out the other.<br /><br />They are far more comfortable than they look, given their size.  They are fully adjustable, and sit well on the head.  I could wear them for hours.  In fact, I may see if I can use them in place of my headset at work, because they are that comfortable and that high quality.<br /><br />They have switchable side plates, either a montage of marvel characters, or Thor.

This keyboard though only worked for 3 days. On the last day tested on two PCs, drivers installed, it began to miss every other keystroke, and duplicating other keystrokes unless I typed extremely slow. I type a minimum 40 wpm so not insanely fast as is. I saw a few reviews stating this and assumed that they either received a defective unit or that they did not install drivers or something.

Every Friday and Saturday night it was a trip to the local mall to pick up chicks and play some skill.  When there were no chicks that dug us, we'd spend more time playing skill.  Needless to say, we became very good at playing pinball.  The site of walking into that arcade will never be repeated.  Three rows of machines lined up side by side at least 20 deep.  The pesky and annoying video games were just starting to show up, but were in their own little area.  They ruined pinball like MP3's ruined hard media.  I remember playing Gorgar and Firepower at the mall and these are on this game.<br /><br />As far as the game play goes, this game is done really well.  It takes a little getting used to the PS3 controller instead of using buttons on the side of the machine.  And shaking the machine is different too, but much less tiring!  But other than that, the ball physics are very realistic and I can almost feel myself regressing back to those golden times in the arcade.  Even the music is somewhat appropriate because we were metal heads.  The best machine on this game is Funhouse.  There's nothing like a wise cracking dummy egging you on to keep the game exciting.  I don't think I could ever tire of it.<br /><br />The only knocks on the game I have are that the replay should have been the traditional \"thwack\" sound that a solenoid produced when hitting the side of the cabinet.  In the game it's just a cash register sound.  The other thing I would have liked is the ability to view the play field under my control so I can examine every square inch of it.  The instructions show you most of it, but it's not under your control.  Also they don't show much of the back glass.  The back glass was always a work of art and usually had some large breasted babe somewhere on it.<br /><br />Now we just have to lobby for them to come out with Bally collection and redo the Gottlieb collection.  Then there will no need to ever leave the house.  This is an excellent game and would highly recommend it.  Time for some skill!",

            "question": "title: EA You Need To Get Your Imagination Back.  This Is Boring.\ntext: I bought this for my daughter.  She played it for an hour and got bored.  Without knowing what other's have been saying, she said it was more a stuff pack and not so much an expansion. She liked the stuff that was in it, but didn't really see how this added to the overall gameplay.  So guess what?  She went back to playing Sims 2.  I play the Sims also and have to be honest with my displeasure of Sims 3 overall.  IT'S BORING FOLKS.  Even with the expansions it just is not as good as Sims 2.  Now before you argue with me and get all upset.  You have to admit that the Sims 2 when it first came out was far better than the Sims 3 when it first came out.  I got bored with Sims 3 within a few days.  Where as Sims 2 I played for months.  And when a new idea comes, I play again.  The interactions in Sims 3 are limited and I don't like the role-playing aspect of it.  It seems to me to be a little too controlling.  Having an expansion called Generations to me is a rip off.  Why?  Well because these sort of interactions should have already been in the game in the first place.  To me this should have been part of the appeal of Sims 3 when it came out.  As others have said, it looks like EA is nickel and diming us for each and every so called \"improvement\" to the game.  Seriously EA are ya that greedy?  Earning millions upon millions of dollars hasn't been enough for you?  Adding more interactions and \"stuff\" should not be an expansion and more like a improvement patch to the game.  I saw a photoshop cover for a Sims 3 Fantasy, totally made up of course but that caught my attention.  THAT would be an expansion.  A Sims 3 expansion with a new town that has everything Fantasy.  Fairies, Witches, Unicorns, etc.  And buildings/houses to go along with it.  It doesn't have to be Fantasy, it can be back in time like Victorian with the clothing and furnishings or Pirates, or Aliens.  See the possibilities?  With free play and NOT like Sims Medieval.  EA you need to get your imagination back.  These ideas of yours show a major disconnect with what the consumers want.  The only reason people are buying these expansions is because they are trying to get their Sims 3 to be the same caliber as Sims 2 and hoping beyond hope that just one more expansion will reach it; but it just doesn't and we the consumer are disappointed yet again.",

I figured this was a good place to start, decent price to start out.  I am in love with this.  Through research I learned that blue switches are the loudest of the clicky sounds, and that is what I wanted.  Boy did I make the right call on this.  I have never written a review this long, but I can't help it.  Did I even just become a better typer?  I can't stop.  The mouse is also very nice, I do have smaller hands, and this mouse is a big on the big side, however it is fine to use.  I didn't like my old mouse because I would hit the side buttons on it all of the time, and that would happen during sensitive work and I would be sent backwards.  I hope that will not happen with this mouse.  This is a grteat keyboard for new to mechanical keyboard world.",

            "question": "title: Almost perfect - 9/10\ntext: The controller feels fantastic in your hands.  This is especially apparent after trying to use the tiny joycons with their even tinier buttons and joysticks.  If your an adult with moderate to large hands you need this controller.  Playing games like Resident Evil 5 or Doom feel worlds better with a controller that is designed for hands larger than a 10 year old's.  Using the controller mount for the joycons is not a substitute for a pro controller.  After using the pro controller, you realize that the joycon's tiny buttons, joysticks, and shoulder buttons are things you tolerate.  Even if you decide against buying this controller (most likely due to the price), buy a cheaper third party traditional controller.  Comfort - 10/10<br /><br />The buttons are large, which I love, reminding more of the larger buttons seen on the original SNES controller.  The buttons along with the D-pad have a matte finish that feel great.  A special mention of the D-pad must be made.  This D-pad feels fantastic.  Compared to the 8bitdo SN30 pro, it is NO CONTEST.  The D-pad for Nintendo's pro controller is top of the line and blows the third party D-pads out of the water.  The Joysticks feel good, maybe even great.  They have raised edges with ridges for increased grip which feel good on your thumbs.  I still prefer the concave shape of the Xbox One joysticks but the switch pro controller joysticks are comfortable, responsive, and accurate.  Compared to the Wii U pro controller, the joysticks feel less sturdy though.  The Wii U pro controller feel sturdy and require more effort to move them, which I like.  This is not a big deal but I feel some may not like joysticks that have less resistance. Buttons and Joysticks - 9/10<br /><br />When it come to the value, the switch pro controller is a sea of grey.  It really depends on the value you place on each individual feature found in the pro controller.  The third party enhanced switch controllers are around 20$ cheaper and feel close to the same but lack many of the features the pro controller has (it doesn't even have basic rumble).  You can also find even cheaper controllers that don't have even the most basic features of a pro controller but are still fine controllers if all your looking for is a comfortable gaming experience for your hands.  I like the HD rumble and motion controls and would like to have the convenience of amiibo support (even though I don't really see it lasting much longer) so I don't mind paying the 70$.  Nintendo's controllers are also known for lasting forever, so you most likely won't need to buy another one for the rest of your life (I still use the gamecube and Wii U pro controllers I got at the launches).  Overall Value - 8/10",

Its dark, its foreboding and its beautiful  Its not about having super fast reflexes, dodging a million bullets at a million MPH, which has its place and is fine for other SHMUPs, but this franchise is different- you weave your way through traffic as if you are in the matrix- thoughtfully and deliberately, moving your force back and forth and angling them at just the right place.  As the game moves along, it builds upon each stage, getting darker and presenting you with more unique and interesting challenges and bosses.<br /><br />This game should be played with sound via the digital out port of the PS2 and into your stereo, properly attuned for best sound. Video wise either you use a component cable or RGB and have it line doubled via an OSSC or the like.  It will be worth it because they did not skip on any facet of the game.

Silent Hill 2 and Alone in the Dark (Aline) are the others at the top of the list. The text is disturbing and the music is super creepy. So if you have a weak stomach, then this one isn't for you. At times, it can get very frustrating because basically the whole game you're going through a bunch of mazes. There's also some backtracking involved and it can get quite confusing and you can get lost very easily. It can get boring and repititive so you may want to take a break once in a while. The story is very chilling and has two parts, one that you can play after you beat the main game. Some of the puzzles aren't that difficult but others you may have a tough time. If you see a warning message about sharp metal, then DO NOT click on that spot. You will get hurt and you CAN die. So be sure to save.<br />If you're ready to explore the world of darkness and terror, then Theresia awaits.",

            "question": "title: Satisfying To Type On\ntext: I've been through basically all of the gaming keyboards now. I've felt the top echelon each brand has to offer i.e. Razer, Corsair, Logitech, Steelseries.<br />The only other keyboard that I think comes close to this one is the Apex Pro TKL, but this one is still better.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Switches offer just the right amount of feedback, so you aren't always making mistakes when typing on these very, very smooth linear switches.<br />2. The stabilizers are very good on these switches.<br />3. The feeling of the actual keycaps are pleasant. It just feels good to type on these switches. They have a nice bounce back to them that make them feel more responsive than other keyboards.<br />4. The RGB on this keyboard is far and away the best of any keyboard out there. There are other keyboards with brighter lighting, like the Apex Pro TKL, but the AIMO intelligent mode on this thing is unreal. It kind of just slowly and smoothly mixes the colors in and out on your keyboard. It's hard to explain, but it's easily the most pleasant rgb experience of all the keyboards I have had.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. ABS keycaps. Okay- so this doesn't matter to me this much, but these are ABS keycaps and they most definitely DO collect a lot of oil so, if you spend a lot of time looking at your keycaps for some reason, be prepared to clean them often.<br />2. Height- this keyboard is not low profile by any means. You will want a wrist rest with this keyboard. I bought a glorious wooden one and it wasn't too bad that way. I prefer using the one that came with my apex pro tkl though and it works perfectly.<br />3. The ping. This bothers some people apparently. It's there and you'll notice it but if you wear headphones, even open back ones- it's basically a non-issue. I like the sound otherwise.<br /><br />Differentiating with the Apex Pro TKL, the keys on this keyboard are a little heavier but just as smooth. It's easier to make typos on the Apex Pro TKL because the keys are so light. Now, that can be taken care of by changing the sensitivity of the keys on the Apex, but I don't like messing with that all the time and prefer to keep the sensitivity high. That means it might not even be an issue for you.<br />Also, because the keycap design on the Vulcan TKL Pro is so different, it might be hard to find replacement keycaps for it. I put some Razer PBT keycaps on my Apex Pro TKL and it feels great. Took care of the ABS shine and everything.<br /><br />Overall though, I spend my time using the Vulcan because I love the typing experience and I find the lighting very tasteful and pleasant.",

Lots of snow and static on screen that didnt show up in a screen mirror on your real screen.<br /><br />Was ignored and treated very poorly by oculus support. After almost a month of using I frantically boxed it up and sent it back to amazon.<br /><br />I think I might pick up another from best buy and see if it does the same thing or not.

So I realized I better return this thing asap!<br /><br />I wish they were being more honest about the issues as I would repurchase once issues are fixed.<br /><br />Biggest let down with this device is trying to play non vr games in a vr theater. It absolutely does not work! The oculus drivers upscale everything into 4k even if the monitor being displayed is only 1920x1080... this results in unbearable stutter in the majority of non vr games. And this is something that an oculus go can handle over wifi with open source software like alvr and moonlight for go so I am shocked to see they dropped the ball so badly by not having a 1080p theater gaming mode.... it's actually unforgivable and I think I would have returned this item due to that fact alone if I wasnt having the USB power and snow static issues....<br /><br />I think they rushed the software and the skimped on costs for a high quality cable...",

            "question": "title: PES 2012\ntext: Every year I had faithfully coughed up $60 for the new FIFA. And every year I felt like it was a steep price for what was basically a roster upgrade. The game played like an arcade game, with balls sort of ping-ponging around from player to player. I love FIFA's licensing (obviously), and its glitzy presentation. But this year, I finally decided to try PES instead. And I'm definitely glad I did. I think the gameplay itself puts it head and shoulders above FIFA.<br /><br />\"Head and shoulders\" makes me think of headers, which were nearly impossible in FIFA. It's been a huge problem for years with that franchise. The PES functions a lot like real life. I can get the ball out wide and cross it in headers, that guys get on the end of, and sometimes score - or head out of bounds more times than not. This makes me happy because it looks like the real stuff you see on TV.<br /><br />Teammate AI is better in PES - the defensive help is quite realistic. I think the opponent AI is good too. Even on Amateur (yes, I'm old and I suck), if you do dumb things, the game will score on you.<br /><br />The goals in FIFA always seemed to come from specific spots on the pitch year-after-year. Once you found those spots, you were golden. In PES though, I've seen all kinds of crazy goals from different spots, which I love. I had a low cross from the end-line (almost impossible to perform in FIFA's past) - going across the front of the goalie - ricochet in off a defender's back, for example.<br /><br />Obviously it sucks for the licensing and the player names. You have to edit some team names, players, especially in the English Premier League since only Tottenham and Manchester United are fully licensed. I think we can all agree that it is annoying. But, if you don't mind tweaking some of the info a bit (or I'm sure there are downloads available online), it is a worthwhile time investment.<br /><br />Also, you can customize a lot of stuff in this. So you can build your own team with your own players then sub them into the EPL for example. I wish more games in general, especially sports games, gave you MORE customization. If you wanted to make your own City Men's 40+ year old's League, with their complete jerseys, you could do it...<br /><br />I like the Champions League presentation (with the epic song) too. I hate the PES main menu music though; FIFA has the catchier menu music. I never thought I'd notice it, but PES is kind of cheap there, and you hear it ALL the time. Master League/ Manager Mode is pretty good, and I would say better than FIFA's version last year, but to be fair, they're similar to each other. It's easy to go over budget on player salaries, though, if you are not careful. Also, selling players on the Transfer market is very difficult, so I just end up releasing them and paying the severance fee. I don't play online, so I can't say how good/bad that part is.<br /><br />Overall though, if you like football/soccer a lot, then this is the game to get. I wish EA didn't have a monopoly on the rights to most sports games, since competition is always a good thing. I would love to see what PES would do with EA's full licenses!",

            "question": "title: Nice update to a great game in a great series\ntext: Rainbow Siege fans likely already bought this (or the Year 2 DLC to go with the original), and it holds its own for folks looking for more of the same.  It doesn't really break any new ground but the scenarios and maps are of a great quality, and it will hold its own after hours (or days) of play.<br /><br />For fans of other FPS games, well you may like it or may quickly revert to Battlefield or COD.  For starters, while all of these series have a strong multiplayer, this (and Rainbow Six in general) has a week (and that's putting it kindly) single player.  It's not a deal breaker for occasional multiplayers, but it is for folks who will only play this solo.  In addition, this is much more tactical and far less run and gun.  Life is precious and deliberate teamwork beats twitchy shooting.<br /><br />4 stars due to the fact that some folks will prefer other FPS games, plus the fact that this is a $30 game (a year old) with new DLC.  I appreciate the face that they made a package for those new to the series and DLC for existing owners, so it's really the former rather than the latter.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend this to Rainbow Six fans, but then again they likely already own the original Rainbow Six Siege game and will need the standalone DLC.",

            "question": "title: unique charm and gameplay without the gore\ntext: It's fair to say that Steambot Chronicles is unlike any other game you'll have played, and it's probably best suited to fans of eclectic games.  It is a fusion of game styles using elements of a sim-type game, a few economic principles, vehicle combat, roleplaying story, with some emphasis on musical performances.  In other words, it's hard to define by normal game labels.<br /><br />The game is not a big-budget production, and I would not want to pay full price for it.  But as a collector of off-the-wall or niche games, this one is a perfect addition to my library.  It makes me laugh, keeps me curious, and is usually relaxing.<br /><br />You can only play as a boy character, a teenager who has lost his memory during a cruise ship accident.  The technology is early 1900's, in a fictional country similar to the US.  However, this world has developed the splendid Trotmobile, a sort of 19th century robot that requires a pilot.  Your trotmobile can be used for commerce or combat and is the focus of the game.  However, you will also spend a good deal of time meeting people, running errands, and raising money to support your other habits.<br /><br />The game should not be taken too seriously, partly because is intentionally light, and partly because it's a bit choppy in places, and you'll be disappointed if you depend on every plot twist to make sense, every action to have a logical result.  But if you can take the story with a grain of salt, it is wonderful and very charming.  The graphics are not first-rate, but they do have a unique style and simple charm.<br /><br />Technical prowess is not one of the game's strong points.  There are sometimes load lags, as you pass into new territories, which seem unreasonably long.  The camera work is sometimes choppy, and the camera angles are occaisonally frustrating.  I find myself able to forgive these weaknesses for the sake of playing in this game world, but it is something to consider, if technical finesse is important to you.<br /><br />Parents:  Language used in the game is almost completely mild (there will be the occasional minor expletives).  There is no graphic sexual or violent content.  There are mild references to romance, as dating is a part of the game.  There is also violence, as you'll be clubbing and shooting mechanical opponents fairly regularly, but it's all within tasteful limits, in my opinion.  I would let a small child watch me play without any worries.  A lot of girls might like this game,  so it's a real shame they didn't allow for a female lead character.<br /><br />The reviewers here critical of this game should probably be playing a more mainstream, less artful game.  This game is for the rest of us, who enjoy a break from the dull, repetitive products that come from the major game houses.",

A game is supposed to be fun, isn't it?<br /><br />My Player mode is extremely unforgiving difficult game.<br />Part of the goal of the mode is to be a good team mate and work your way up as a starter. To do that, you do the nitty gritty things like set screens for your players. This works, only sometimes, and other times the AI players simply just stand there. Wasting time, waiting for your ballhandler to make a move. I'm begging the AI to come on, please start the play! We'll talk about being hypocritical in a moment here.<br />Playing as point guard, you get punished for holding the ball too long, by a large margin. Hey now, I'm trying to survey the floor looking for a good pass! Oh hey, a player is cutting towards the basket so I'll pass the ball to him. But oops! He continues running around the opponent and they intercept or tip the ball. Bass pass penalty, major points lost. What? So what is it? Do I take my time looking for the players to stop running and get the good pass or do I try to rush a pass to a running player?<br />Playing defense is brutal as well. You can't stand in close because the opponent will run right past you leaving you chasing them. Or you can't stand back a bit and they'll just shoot a jumper over you. Is there even anything we can do to prevent the major lost of points for allowing your man to score?<br />Okay well another problem is deciding who to defend running back after your team misses a shot. Well, hmm, the player defending arrows is pointing one way.. okay I'll go head there to defend. If you rely on the blue circles around opponents to defend, well, good luck because sometimes there are two players which you need to defend at once. Huh? WHAT? Okay, let's pick our position to defend instead. Makes sense right? Wait why is my team mate defending this guy too? The open opponent who just scored was the guy you were supposed to defend. You just lost a major amount of team mate points. Okay now we're chasing a fast breaking opponent down. There are 2 other team mates in front of him and the guy still makes the basket....just trying to help out, but yes more penalties to the team mate score. Oh also, sometimes the passes don't go to the right guy as well.<br /><br />Whatever you do, you're going to get penalized. It's extremely frustrating.<br /><br />There's probably more things I've forgot to mention that's wrong with this game, but let's close up this review. I realize I've ranted long enough already.<br /><br />Another major issue is that it loads slowly. Can't the game play the cut scenes while loading? You simply have to wait out the load times, and watch the cut scenes that are forced on you, for the hundredth time. Get me into the game please!<br /><br />I mean, parts of the game can be fun when you get to play but there are some really difficult things to master, like the shooting timing, the freethrow timing, the idiotic penalties. Don't add on to the frustration with it being just so darn slow to load. And come on, don't throw the player in there on Pro difficulty with no chance to learn the system. Why don't they have rookie enabled for My Player, I don't know.<br /><br />I give up on you NBA 2K11. Maybe I'll try 2K12 when prices drop to more reasonable level.",

When placed on the 3DS, there is the normal amount of glare as should be expected.<br /><br />What I like about this protector<br />- Made by Hori.  Their products are good quality.<br />- It covers the entire top panel rather than just the viewing area like other screen protectors<br />- Most importantly, it covers the touch screen which needs the most protection due to usage<br /><br />What bothered me<br />- The purple tint around the outer edges of the upper screen.

The pieces don't fit together well, and it requires some patience to get the threads to line up properly.<br />2. The base that holds the controller feels flimsy, and if you use too much force to unscrew the attachment, it'll probably break.<br />3. The base is uncomfortable for small hands, especially for the baseball grip.<br />4. You lose the vibration effect<br />5. In baseball, you have to take the controller out of the handle to pitch, or else look rather silly pitching with a bat in your hand.  It doesn't take long, but it's something you don't need to do if you're not using the accessory.<br />6. You'll need to take the controller out of the padded sleeve before using these accessories.

You unlock more hamsters as you play the game and make it through the various mazes. Some are more difficult than others to find your way through - but my daughter just enjoyed running through them whether she made it to the end or not.<br /><br />It's one of her most-played games so I really recommend it to the young crowd.

            "question": "title: Rather Nice Wireless Headphones {Edited}\ntext: [[VIDEOID:27650cd0317fc1e6114d8bac39cb39d6]] These headphones sound really good. They're not world class but as far as affordable headphones go these fit the bill. I listened to a variety of music, classical, jazz, rock, prog, metal and using the Bass mode EQ/sound effect setting. I'm very amused the headphones pronounce bass like the fish. Other than Bass mode these have; Classic and Vocal modes.<br />Bass mode worked well once I adjusted the equalizers in my tablet and phone. A little fish, I mean bass, heavy but the highs are there, fairly sharp and clear.<br />Classic mode is the happy medium setting. I find this is good for listening to YouTube channels where someone is talking/reacting to something.<br />Vocal mode. . . Maybe good for phone calls? Unfortunately I didn't receive or make any calls. Honestly this mode made everything sound horrible.<br />The lighting is rather cool you can have static single colors, I was particularly fond of the green and red they're very vibrant but all the colors are well done. Then you can have your single color pulse/fade in and out, next you you can cycle all the colors one after the other. Finally you can have a color chasing rainbow where all the colors display and cycle around in a circle. This is my favorite mode. My only complaint is you can't see the groovy colors when you're wearing the headphones!<br />The microphone on these is clever. There's just a small nub not much bigger than a pencil's eraser that protrudes from the front of the left side.  you gently pull on this to extend the microphone boom. It easily slides back into the headphone. It appears that even though the unit has a memory function, remembering color settings and which sound mode you used, you apparently have to mute the microphone each time you power on the unit.<br />Fit and finish are good, not great, I've got a kinda large head and these are just the slightest bit tight but I'd rather that than loose. I used them for a couple hours last night then fell asleep with them on and woke up hours later. They can be worn a long time. Cups are nicely soft and breathe okay. In a warm room you may sweat. I'm not sure these are suitable for kids or irresponsible teens/adults. The hinges that allow you to lay these flat look like metal but they're plastic. Heavy play, flexing too much and they'll break. They're hefty but have a very soft pad that sits on top of your head.<br />Battery life seems to be excellent. I had the rainbow colors cycling and had them powered on for over nine hours and they were playing at least six, my tablet rebooted sometime after I fell asleep.<br />As an affordable set of headphones that sound pretty dang good (adjust your devices EQ if it has one) have long battery life and fit well these are something I would definitely recommend.<br /><br />P. S.<br />I know some reviewers have said these are too quiet or very quiet. I don't blast my ears like I did growing up (I'm 56) so with the volume on the headset maxed and each device having the sound up, never maxed, these were more than loud enough to hear everything I listened to.<br /><br />Edit - A couple things to add.<br />• I wear glasses, these are reasonably when wearing glasses.<br />• I needed to open the headband up two notches on each side for a better fit. I just wanted to note that the corners of the plastic exposed when opened are pointy and quite sharp!<br />• Had an accidental durability test the other day. I was sitting in my wheelchair when a nurse came in to talk to me. I pushed my headphones up and a little too far. They fell approximately four feet onto a tile floor. Absolutely no damage.<br />• If you put these on and can't hear anything even after checking the volume in whatever app you're using and your system settings. Check the volume wheel on the headset, It's really easy to accidentally roll it all the way down.",

            "question": "title: A great start with lots of potential - Potential failed... Cancelled my sub.\ntext: Leaving my previous review below, because it was written before patch 1.2 and what this game was to become, so you can read my original optimism!<br /><br />What ruined potential.  Once you hit level 50, the game becomes an absolute mindless grind, with no sense of purpose at all.  It is one thing to do the same raids over and over if they are fun or have purpose, but it loses its luster quickly and becomes the usual (stand on the x, hit the 3 key seven times, then the 5 key times and then stand on spot Y).  The PvP (basically now reduced to warzones ONLY) have absolutely no sense of purpose, except to grind for gear.  They are supposedly introducing \"team\" play, but they missed the opportunity to have a overall purpose to the PvP, such as helping your chosen FACTION.  Open world PvP is non-existent and had no sense of purpose either.<br /><br />For a game that started off telling an amazing story... it completely loses its way towards the end and you just don't care about what happens anymore.<br /><br />Space combat.. great potential gone wrong.  You wind up repeating the exact same space missions during your initial progressions.  (The level 40 missions are the exact same as the level 20 missions, just with slightly higher goals (kill 40 fighters instead of 20).<br /><br />When they added content to the story in patch 1.2.. I didn't both to complete it as I had stopped caring about the storyline.<br /><br />It's a shame, because this could have been a fantastic game, but they took the easy way out and decided to turn it into a mindless grind.<br /><br />This is defiantly one of the better MMO's and has some aspects that make it much better than the rest.<br /><br />The Best Aspects:<br /><br />The story line is fantastic and the voice acting makes it much more enthralling than other games which simply present you with a wall of text.  It maintains the feel of both an MMO and single player game.<br /><br />Crafting.  Finally a game got this right.  You don't have to spend endless boring hours grinding away at resource gathering and standing over a forge.  You get companions in the game and send them on missions and they gather the resources for you and craft the items, earning you experience.  This is the first MMO where I am actually doing the crafting.<br /><br />They have nice bonus systems to encourage you to group, but you don't HAVE TO if you don't want to in order to complete your story line.  (If you group with others you earn experience from them completing quests as well as you own, so you level much faster!)<br /><br />The Good Aspects:<br /><br />Space combat is a lot of fun, but isn't fleshed out yet.  You can do space missions, but are essentially stuck on a rail as your ship steers itself through space and you control where and what you shoot, with small room for movements.<br /><br />Characters are pretty customizable, as you can switch your skill tree.  So you can go up the healing tree and then decide you want to do DPS and go back to your trainer and spend some credits to reassign your skills. (You get the first swap for free).  You can also create interesting hybrid characters, who can serve dual purposes.<br /><br />What needs work:<br /><br />The PVP just isn't there yet.  There isn't anything to encourage people into open world PvP, so it is pretty much restricted to \"warzones\".  These are mini, repeatable instances where they put equal number of republic and empire and give them a goal to achieve.  Great idea.. execution isn't there yet.  There is no in game voice communication, so you get thrown into a random group and then it becomes difficult to execute because you can't communicate quickly.  Further they put people of all levels into the same warzone and although they scale your HP up to level 50, unless you are level 50, your gear and skills aren't on par.  (Hopefully they will bracket the warzones in the future to make them more balanced).<br /><br />Overall, however, this is a great game that has lots of potential.  Hopefully they resist the urge to go with other MMO's have gone before them and just turn it into a constant grind for gear.  Right now, it isn't grindy and that alone makes it worth playing!",

The lighting effects are very bright, and it's clear that the company has emphasized this in their design.  All buttons work and are very responsive, with good haptic feedback when you press them.  I'd like the sides to be a little nicer - the area wher your thumb and pinky grip the mouse are pretty low-quality in comparison to competitors, even in this price range.<br /><br />Of note, the cord is particularly long.  This is excellent for anyone who uses a setup like mine where my PC is on the \"wrong\" side of my desk, and my cable management requires a long distance to travel from case to desktop.",

It still worked on others, though. I tried taking apart the entire left side of the keyboard and cleaning it, but nothing worked.

Maybe a little too tight since it left a small line scratch on the right side of the case when I tried taking the switch off the dock. It’s a minor scratch and didn’t bother me much, but I didn’t want to further risk getting any more scratches or having to take off the case to use the dock every time, so getting a dock that actually supports switches with cases can be an option, like the Skull & Co dock for example. The case isn’t bad tho. It snaps right on and is easy to remove from the switch itself.

            "question": "title: Impressive\ntext: &#34;Wow,&#34; is the best I can think of to say about this game.  It's really something and I like it a lot.  Usually I only play serious strategy games such as Civilization and my past forays into console games have been far less than satisfactory.  Thanks to the other reviewers here I decided to give this one a try and I'm very glad I did.<br /><br />At first I was wondering if it is just an interactive story.  I'm not much for the story aspects of games and it took several scenes before actual game play comes up.  Surprisingly, I held in there and after the first couple short missions I was hooked.  The story itself is not overly original but also not so common as to be boring.  The main characters are likeable enough and as things progressed I found myself interested in what was going on and anxious to find out what would happen next.<br /><br />So then, the Pros:  The Graphics, great!  I wasn't sure what to think of the watercolor/cartoon/anime mix at first but after seeing it in action I'm hooked.  While most modern games seem to be going for the &#34;real as life&#34; look this game looks softer, less in your face.  Also on the plus side of things is the ease of play.  It was easy to learn how things work and to understand the goals and objectives set out.  I got an Xbox controller to use with it, my first time ever using one, and I'm having a great time with it.<br /><br />Another plus, to me, is the music.  I often turn the music or all sound off when playing games because I usually find it distracting or somehow undesirable.  This one is different and interesting is that parts of the music, while certainly different, is reminiscent of songs I've heard, some old and some not so old.<br /><br />On the Cons side of things I'm coming up a little short.  I would prefer to not have go through a configuration launcher every time and sometimes the story plays on emotions in ways I'd rather it didn't.  Sometimes the story scenes are a bit long and I would get impatient for the next mission.  And of course there's always those times such as when my best gunner totally misses the house sized tank 20 feet in from of him and gets me ranting and wanting an undo/redo/wtf button.  But that's part of luck and chance and it wouldn't be a real game without.  None of these things warrant losing even one star so my rating stands at 5 out of 5.<br /><br />All in all I think this is one of the most refined and polished games I've ever played.  It's done.  Totally complete and playable on initial download.  No waiting weeks or months for patches and updates.  No hours spent grinding through forums hoping to find a fix for some inane problem.  This game works and works well.<br /><br />When the next episode or book in the story is released for the PC I will most certainly buy it too.<br /><br />5 out of 5 stars for this one and kudos for the developers.  Well Done!",

The game graphics are OK, but there is a lot of character model clipping and it can be difficult to shoot around obstacles.  Here are some highlights of why I give a 2 star rating, rather than rehash what has already been said:<br /><br />1.  The game starts pretty well.  Heavy story and good usage of cutscenes to draw you in.  The aiming system isn't such a stickler for accuracy so shooting isn't bad.<br />2.  LOTS of guns!  Each one is useful in some way.  You'll never run short on ammo unless you are camping.<br />3.  Lots of different things to do.  From a guided drone tank to heli flying, you get to do lots of good stuff.<br />4.  Lots of save points<br /><br />What I didn't like:<br />1.  Models are kind of clunky, even if they are detailed.  Korean soldiers mostly wear yellow and red so you can see them; there's no tactical value in dressing like a paramilitary Ronald McDonald.<br />2.  Over-the-top movie morals where the bad guys are so HORRIBLY bad that you have full license to kill them in any way you can....unless it's part of the plot to feel sorry to kill them.<br />3.  There Is NO free will in this game.  It's a shooter on rails.  You fail at a mission, you just keep trying over and over until you figure it out.  Prompts are not always helpful....<br />4.  The enemy AI consists of two modes:  super sniper mode (where you are behind cover but still get shot by enemies across the map) and move mode (where they either camp behind one obstacle until they die or run at you in the open without taking cover).  This game also LOVES to have your teammates shout (IT'S CLEAR!) then you get killed by a single bad guy who suddenly pops up behind you!<br />5.  Enemies respawn infinitely until you progress to a certain point.  I didn't realize this until halfway through the game when I was running out of ammo and having to run forward to grab guns on the ground....then the enemies would stop coming.<br />6.  You have magic regenerating health<br /><br />I didn't play the multiplayer version (I got this used and wasn't about to pay for an online pass) so I can't comment on that.  I CAN say that this is, like most THQ games, mediocre, at best.  If you can get it for 5 or 6 bucks like I did, then it's worth a try.",

            "question": "title: Far more accurate to the books/movies than the other HP games\ntext: Most of the other Harry Potter games I have played in the past do not follow the books/movies all that well, but this one (Lego Harry Potter) follows them very well! I was quite pleased and had a smile on within the first 5 minutes of game play. It's a very cute game, has it's comical moments, while still staying true to the Harry Potter story itself. I enjoy listening to the background music in this game as well because it comes straight from the movie itself, unlike other past Harry Potter games I have played that insert their own music. I'll admit that the controls are a little funny to get used to at first, but I quickly caught on to how it all works and it is now second nature to me. You use both the wii remote and nunchuck to play this game.<br /><br />Overall, this game is a must for Harry Potter and Lego game fans. I would highly recommend this game. It is a lot of fun. I should add that I also own Lego Star Wars for the Playstation 2 as well. If you enjoyed Lego Star Wars, or probably any Lego game for that matter, and enjoyed it then Harry Potter is just as fun =)<br /><br />UPDATE as of 1/23/2011: I decided to bump this from 5 stars to 4 stars. Why, you may ask? Well, I ran into a glitch that caused me a lot of problems. I got to a part in my game where I had to use magic to put lego pieces together in order to continue on with the story. Well, one of the lego pieces got stuck and continually disappeared, then reappeared, then disappeared, and then reappeared over and over and over again! I in turn kept attempting to use my magic to move the puzzle piece, but it kept disappearing too quickly to give me a chance to fix the glitch! I then quit the game and tried going back in a second time to see if it would go back to normal, but the glitch was apparently saved, so that was no help at all. At first I thought I had to start all over again, which angered me to no end because I was pretty far into the game. What I did instead was repeated another level from start to finish. Amazingly, this fixed the glitch. I replayed a previous level I had already beaten, and then when I went back to the level with the glitch I realized it disappeared!! I was finally able to continue!<br /><br />It's unfortunate that I have to knock off a star due to a glitch problem, but it does ruin the fun when you have to replay another level just to fix a problem with the game. If it wasn't for glitches I would have kept it at 5 stars.",

I believe there is a great game here underneath all the bugs and the server connection issues.  I managed to create a couple of cities, my biggest has a population of 34k.  I actually played for about 8 hours total.  However, there has been a lot of downtime due to server downtime, updates and maintenance.  It is clear however that they are working on it.  They have added some servers, and they have patched the game twice so far.  The past couple of hours were pretty stable for me so things seem to be improving as of this writing.  I do believe they will resolve the issues they are having, it will just take a little time.  My biggest gripe is that it is clear they knew the number of people about to slam their servers based on pre-orders and other data from their forum traffic, why did they not ensure a smoother launch experience than they did.  To me that is just clear evidence that EA is not interested in ensuring their customers get the experience they paid for.  They happily took our money and kept silent about the potential issues we would face on launch day and beyond.  Shame on EA for treating paying customers like cattle.",

Units will target workers before attacking units and defensive structures and, once engaged, they will pursue their targets until you tell them to do something else. Some of the larger units (titans, colossi, etc.) are so large and slow they need to be manually controlled at all times or else they will stand behind the front lines and walk back and forth like idiots until an opening to attack appears (combine this with the retarded priority and you get units that will walk back and forth behind the front lines trying to get at a unit on the other side even though there are enemies right next to him posing an immediate threat).<br /><br />Units need to deal more damage, as battles drag out much longer than they should.",

If you like keyboards that give you nice key feel when you press it you will like this keyboard. This keyboard has become my main keyboard. I have a couple other gaming keyboards and so far I like this one the best. The keys are a medium/high height. It is easy to type on and works fine for me. I don't use the keyboard to its full potential, but it is really great. The lights look nice too",

I dont tend to use the DPI settings all that much, but it does help a lot during 3d modeling work or spreadsheets. I also was able to remap a few keys so that I have a forward and back page button, a play/pause music button, and the thumb trigger is bound to zero for esior key binding in games. I do not get much use out of the unlock able scroll wheel unless im in a long PDF, but event then its more fun to play with then piratical.<br /><br />my only complaints about it are-<br />-the wire will tangle and knot up under the fabric sheath, so I ended up having to remove that part<br />-its somewhat hard to clean, and dust gets into all of its cracks<br />-the scroll wheel has a side to side function that is useful but if you are trying to click with scroll wheel it sometimes misaligned and goes to the right or left instead of clicking. not too much of an issue but can be annoying in fast paced games.<br /><br />But all in all its grate.",

            "question": "title: There's a reason this game is cheap\ntext: One of the worst singing games I have ever played and I have played most of them. Do NOT waste your money, I am telling you now you WILL regret it.<br /><br />Pros: 1) Game starts with 40 song options 2) cheap price of $10 or less 3) You can add the songs you want to play to a playlist.<br /><br />Cons: Everything else. Most of the songs are covers and they don't sound too great. Combine their horrible singing with my equally as bad if not worse singing and you'll have the neighbors calling 911 reporting a disturbance. The sound quality is terrible. Your recording is like 0.5 secs behind the game, the playback audio is way too loud (and delayed) and just the over all sound quality of the cover is low.<br /><br />Honestly this is a game I would expect from a college student practicing game development. The songs sound like they were recorded at home with a low quality microphone on a laptop with ProTools.<br /><br />It doesn't take any skill or effort to get perfect pitch and 5 stars. You can sing in a high pitch off key voice the entire time and get a perfect pitch and perfect score. Also if you pause the game at all after you start a song it makes you restart at the beginning. You can't adjust the microphone during the song either so if it's too low or too loud you have to quit or sing thru it.<br /><br />I wish Singstar would come out with a new game for PS4. I've been playing since Singstar: Pop came out on PS2. I have all of the games from Singstar on PS2 & PS3 (btw singstar mic doesn't work). I have a few other singing games that were okay but nothing compares to Singstar especially this game. I played 5 songs and probably won't play anymore. SINGSTAR PLEASE COME BACK!!",

This headset is none of those.<br /><br />This headset hits the sweet spot between comfort/quality and price. Any less and you'll find yourself stuck with a cheap feeling headset that just doesn't work or feel as well. Any more, and you're wasting money. Without exaggeration, this headset reminds me of my Bose QC 35's.<br /><br />Highly recommend.",
