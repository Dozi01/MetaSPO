Unfortunately, the stand is so wobbly that it is unusable for anything that requires typing on a laptop or writing notes, drawings, etc. on paper. (see video)  This limits it's use to a book holder, which can also be a problem if you are sensitive to motion when reading (as the book will wobble).  Second, while the product photos clearly show it being used as a standing desk, this is not feasible as the skids are so slippery that the desk will not stay put. In an attempt to rectify this I added non-skid rubber to the skids, which works fine.  Unfortunately, the desk still wobbles and is unusable, and cannot be returned because of the rubber which I added in an attempt to use the product as depicted in the manufacturer photos. This may work as a dining tray in bed, but I can't see it being usable for any sort of work or writing / drawing, etc.",

This tape is thicker than most though still perfectly flexible and transparent.  I've been shipping lots of packages lately and this tape sticks to everything without peeling off or crinkling.

It was fast and with the wireless option, it would work with all the computers in our house.  It scanned and faxed well.  I just wish we could actually get one that works.

Since it had been a few days since I had used the first one, I sat there shaking it and thinking that it needed to be primed. Nothing. I then started checking the others and they were all fine. I tested them all out and they wrote as expected, except for the one without any ink. Of course, the one without ink happens to be one of my favorite colors! The scents are pretty light. There were a couple that I could barely even detect. The packaging does say that they are lightly scented.

They seem a little less fully melted to the page than the original toner, but definitely not nearly enough of a difference to be worried, especially at the price difference.  We got reviewer cartridges a while ago and finally gave up on waiting for the HP one to run out.  We put in the new cartridge and did not get any errors or have any issues seating the cartridge.  It may \"squeak\" a little more when printing, but again, we might be nitpicking too much.  All in all, it pretty much works the same.",

I bought this printer some time ago to print on CDs and it has been a great printer for that. So, when I saw this set of ink that would fit this XP 620 for the price cheaper than the black ink alone by the WE WILL says, the E Co. I had to try it and buy it and to my surprise it worked fine. I was going to give it a lower number because I did not realize that I had to put 2 ink cartridges in at the same time, both of my black inks, the big black and little black was out.  I only replaced the big black at 1st and I still could not print it took me a while to figure out that it was also saying PK and the black, but I got it and it worked fine I had replaced two cartridges instead of 1 as I thought I should. So, it is all to the good. five stars should do it. Thank you for reading my review. I hope it has been helpful to you. God bless you. May the rest of your life be the best of your life.  OZ",

I purchased/tried quite a few markers and I wasn't happy with any of them - they are either too thing, or too light, or dry out too quickly. I didn't want to use paint markers because I need the ink to dry very quickly, within a few seconds, with no chance of rubbing off. So I purchased these instead and I use them only to cross out labels so I don't have to rip off the barcodes. They work quite well on everything except those special hydrophobic/oleophobic labels UPS sometimes uses which repel pretty much everything.<br /><br />I also purchased the 4-pack of Sharpie Pros. I *think* I like those a little better, mostly because they have a broader tip and what I think is blacker (more opaque) ink, not sure. I like having both because where one doesn't work, the other sometimes will, the Milwaukee is rated for a greater number of surfaces than the Sharpie is. If you have to choose one or the other, maybe go with the Sharpie Pro, but these are good too.",

            "question": "title: Accurate Electronic Scale; AccuPost Software Could Be Better\ntext: This  ACCUPOST PP-110 DESKTOP POSTAL SCALE with USB cable and 10-lb. load capacity weighs in 1/8-oz. increments, and seems to be quite accurate for its entire range.  I tested it with letters weighing less than half an ounce or only a few ounces, and compared the weights to those registered by an [[ASIN:B002UEZ2FC Ozeri Professional Digital Kitchen Food Scale]].  Both scales gave the same results.  (This scale replaces my old Pelouze 5-lb. mechanical spring scale, which weighed in 1/2-oz. increments, and wasn't at all accurate for lightweight letters.)<br /><br />I also tested this scale with two 5-lb. bags of sugar, which weighed a total of 10 lbs. 1-1/4 oz.  The results were generally consistent, although a single bag sometimes registered at 5 lbs. 3/4 oz. (instead of 5 lbs. 5/8 oz.)--probably because the extra packaging weight was very close to 3/4 oz.  This scale also weighs in grams and kilograms.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed to learn that the software doesn't automatically calculate the postage that needs to be added to the letter or package.  (I was hoping for software that would let me download postage rate changes to my computer, and then would compute postage amounts automatically whenever I weighed something.)  Instead, you must (1) visit the appropriate USPS, UPS, or FedEx web site, (2) find the appropriate page for calculating postage or shipping, and (3) paste in the weight.  If you're using the MSIE browser, the software will send the weight directly to the calculation page (no pasting required), but this is probably not worth the effort of plugging in the USB cable and getting the weight to display on your computer screen.<br /><br />The software was hard to find--the link in the user's manual didn't work, and the download link on the AccuPost home page didn't work for Windows 7.  Eventually I found a working download link on the AccuPost 10 lb. scale product page in the AccuPost Online Store.  The Win7 software requires Microsoft NET Framework 4, a free download.  The software itself is a bit glitchy (doesn't always respond if it's been open for a while), but it usually works okay to show and paste in weights, handle the \"tare\" and \"hold\" buttons, and turn the scale on and off.<br /><br />The scale comes with a power adapter, which is great to have if you do a lot of mailing.  Since I don't, I opted to use 3 AA batteries (not included) to power the scale.  The software works with either the power adaptor or the battery option (unplug the power adaptor first).  Because my postal scale is located on a table some 6-8 feet from my computer, I used an [[ASIN:B001TH7GUU AmazonBasics USB Extension Cable]] to successfully supplement the included 40-inch USB cable.<br /><br />The \"tare\" feature works flawlessly:  you can add an item, such as an empty container, then hit \"tare\" to return the weight to zero so that you can put something in the container to find its weight separately.  The \"hold\" feature allows you to hold the weight display when you are weighing something large that overlaps the display--you hit the button and wait for the two beeps, then when you remove the large item the weight will still be showing.  The extra-large numbers in the display are another excellent feature.<br /><br />I like this electronic postal scale a lot, and find that it does everything that's reasonably expected of a postal scale.  However, because of the slightly glitchy and mildly disappointing software, I rate it at 4 stars (\"I like it\" on the official Amazon scale).",

This is a new set, more colors, and a different shape.<br /><br />I received the 14-pen medium point set and the colors are really striking.  I've played with all of them, and the ink color is quite close to the pen color (red is red, turquoise is turquoise, etc.).  They're also quick drying -- much faster than earlier versions of the Inkjoy product.  The size and shape are also nice -- I have severe osteoarthritis especially in my right hand (and of course, I'm right-handed), and the size and shape, combined with the comfort grip (a softer rubber-like material that surrounds the pen) really helps.<br /><br />A note for those into adult coloring books:  Not all gel pens are created equal.  Some are better for writing, others are better for coloring.  In my opinion, these are best used for writing, annotating journals or scrapbooks, etc.  They aren't nearly as well suited to coloring in coloring books.  For one thing, you don't get as much ink in these are you do in gel pens specifically designed for coloring.  These will run out much faster.  Also, they're retractable, which works great for writing and transporting a pen or two in your pocket or purse; not as much for quick access in coloring.  They will work for coloring -- just like any other gel pen, they don't have as much of a bleed-through issue, and you do get a lot of colors that aren't as available in gel pens designed for coloring.  But be aware that if used for coloring, they'll likely run out of ink faster than other brands.<br /><br />That said, I really do like these, and will be using them often in my hand-crafted greeting cards and for annotating my journal.",

            "question": "title: Hard To Use\ntext: I'm a planner junky. This planner has some good parts, but some glaring flaws. The good first:<br />I like the amount of space in each day. You have two columns on a page. You can either plan for two people (or split your work and personal planning in a side by side manner) for 12 hours (beginning at 7). OR you could plan out the entire 24 hours, using one column for day hours and the other for night hours. Each daily page has a small calendar at a glance at the top of the page for the current month, previous month, and next month. The days are numbered with the current day of the year and how many days are left in the year (3/363, 151/214, 289/76, etc.) This does contain the entire year. The last pages is a three year at a glance calendar. It does list holidays on the pages. It does lay completely flat when open.<br />Now, the glaring problems. There are no tabs, so finding a given month to jot something on the calendar isn't quick. Sundays do not get a full day. The bottom of Saturday is cut short at 11 hours instead of 12 hour and you get 4 blank lines for Sunday. If you have busy weekends, this may not work at all. (Which is pretty much where I found myself.) There are no transitions between months. No monthly calendar at all. There is only a tiny space (2 lines) to write non- time specific items. You could put washi tape over all the times and just write in whatever you want. My other issue is the inconsistency in the start of the year and end of the year. The calendar starts on January 1st. Which is a Tuesday. No Sunday and Monday for that week is included. You just start your new calendar on Tuesday. But it doesn't end the same way. You would think if they chose to stick to only 2019, the calendar would also end on a Tuesday, December 31st, right? Nope. It ends on January 3rd, which is a Friday. It didn't even finish that week. Just added three extra days at random. That completely bothers me.",

            "question": "title: Why Do I DO This To Myself?  But Two Packs If you Plan to Use These\ntext: I have been making business cards and other similar things for business for quite a few years now.  Back when I first started to use Avery products, I might have had a few glitches with various printers and programs now and then, but most of the time, printing business cards was a breeze.  They were not to awfully difficult to set up and print, having most of the cards turn out right except perhaps for the last row of cards, perhaps.<br /><br />As time has gone on, however, I tend to get lulled into a sense of stupor, when I think that I can get business cards to print out successfully.  I have tested them on two different printers.  For some reason, the cards don't print out and line up the way that they should.  Being that HP is one of the most common brands of printers, I find that to be doubly frustrating.  I really don't want to have to work THIS hard to get simple business cards to print out.  I really love the idea of two sided cards also.<br /><br />This set of Avery cards is one of the most frustrating I have had to cope with to date.<br /><br />The sheets of cards themselves are well labeled Front and Back so you know how to put them into your printer. They are thick and the perforations are not so flimsy that they come apart before you have a chance to print them out.  Nor are they so hard to get apart that your cards look like they were torn from paper sheets.  I am referring to the appearance of the PHYSICAL cards.  The printed is another story.<br /><br />I have tested these cards over and over in a variety of ways and to this point, I still have not been able to get a sheet to print out the way that it should.  I have used the Avery program as it is with a few different printers, and I have nudged (for printer adjusting)on the Avery site, as well as tried to rearrange the graphics on the card to allow for any hidden marginal errors that seem to be throwing these cards into chaos when they print.<br /><br />I can not do it at this point.<br /><br />WHAT I LIKE<br />-Cards are heavy<br />-Perforations are sturdy<br />-Sheets are labeled well.<br />-Ink prints well on the paper (appearance not location)<br />-Gives me flexibility to hopefully print out unique cards as many as I would like (theoretically, anyway)<br /><br />WHAT I DON'T LIKE<br />-Avery program does not lay out properly for my HP printers<br />-Program on Avery seems to conflict with my printer drivers sending them into freezing etc<br />-Sheets won't print out without printing another sheet afterward<br />-VERY frustrating to try to set up and print.  Takes WAY too much time than it should<br />-Importing another saved Avery product is useless- better to start off fresh<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />If you are planning to use the Avery site to do your printing of cards, I HIGHLY suggest purchasing two packages- one for experimenting and one when you figure out how to make it work.  No matter how many times I use plain paper (as suggested by Avery) when I think I have it right, on the card stock, it just does not line up right.<br /><br />I know there has to be a way to get at least MOST of these to print out so I can use them, but I have not found it yet.  These are great quality cards physically and I plan to do another layout using my graphics professional program and at least getting them to print out fairly well if I can do it.  I have given these three stars because I really do love the idea of it, the physical quality of the double sided cards are great, but it is just the translating it from Avery site to printer to card that I am struggling with.<br /><br />If you plan to do a quick and easy business card printing, you might want to rethink it and give yourself PLENTY of time and experimentation.  If you are one of the lucky ones that gets this to print out perfectly right away- I envy you!<br /><br />UPDATING<br />As with most of my reviews, if I have anything to add in the future or if I find a solution, I will update, re-adjust my rating and let you know about it.<br /><br />PRINTERS USED<br />HP Officejet K550dtn<br />HP Envy 4500",

It's not unattractive per se, but it feels unbalanced and the decorations are just sort of scattered all over it. The message has a distinct immaturity as well. My first impression wasn't of love or adoration, but some poor, acne plagued, 14 year old boy trying to convince his first girlfriend of his undying love.<br /><br />I asked my husband to read it without sharing my impressions.

I tend to buy fun, disposable pens that cost just a fraction of this one. I do have to say that this pen is the smoothest pen I've ever used. The ink flows so smoothly without any interruption. The cheap rollerball pens that I have, usually have some kind of hitch that require shaking or making circles/scratch marks to get the flow going again. This pen had no hesitation or interruption of ink at all which was very impressive. I was also surprised that the ink doesn't smear, at least on the paper I have been using so far. I'm sure a non-porous paper would smear, but I've been running my finger over my writings and there have been no smears at all. The pen comes in a fancy box, ready for gifting. It really is a gift worthy pen if there's such a thing. I do think it's pretty pricey, but it is a quality writing tool.",

While I have moved with the times and have a blended classroom, I am still old school enough to want physical gradebooks and planners.  Since I was paying for it myself I opted for a pretty cover.  It is convenient and I like that I have it all in one book. In the gradebook there are 50 rows to a page.  At first I didn't like this but with my smaller classes I found that i can skip a line between students allowing me to make more notations.  The rows are also shaded every two rows (2 rows white, 2 rows green) which makes it easier to distinguish entries.  Another nice feature is a 6th column at the end of each week. I use it to record daily vocab study on the website we use. The book itself is pretty sturdy and is holding up to the abuse of daily use and transport in my laptop bag. The gradebook pages are perforated at the outside edge which is typical of these books and is useful when you switch marking periods. The perforation is too close.  The pages tear easily when you flip pages.  I ended up using clear tape to secure the page so that I don't end up ripping out the student names. it bothers me enough that I'm not sure I would buy this again.  Others might not mind it so much.",

I like both, not sure which one will get more use. I tend to do use the smaller one for my list making needs. I am always jotting stuff down, and I like that I have a hard surface to write on--- notebooks and the cardboard back of memo pads isn't always enough. I could use a flat clip board, but I use the compartment to store odds-n-ends (ie, coupons, rubber band, paper clips, calculator, writing implements, some other papers).  It is a nice little size for daily use. But,<br /><br />Thoughts:<br />-- I don't see the need (personally) for the cover. If I have a memo pad clipped to the front, the cover may not be able to cover it, depending on where the perforation is (ie, use clip to hold all of memo pad and it would be covered except for one page, and that page would still be attached, but sitting above cover. If perforation mark is low on notebook, then it will interfere with using it this way).  I tried to show it in pictures, but hard to capture.<br />--The clip is strong, and it has teeth, both upper and lower. SO, just having a single piece of paper in the clip jaws will crunch it a bit from pressure of top teeth onto bottom teeth. This would not work well for company documents. As for holding a memo pad in place, or a stack of papers (maybe), it will hold everything together securely. I included a pic that tried to capture this.",

I'm someone who is not picky about print quality, since I'm not doing photos at home. So it's important for me to be able to use 3rd party ink. So I'm not sure what happens for those who do agree to HP+ terms. Do they beam some sort of firmware update that makes it impossible for you to use 3rd party ink? LOL! How will they police this?

Granted, this is marketed as a solution for a \"brick and mortar\" store, but it can be used for those of us that are more nomadic.  If you use the app, you can use this and the customer screen allows the customer to feel more confident and they never give up possession of their credit card.

            "question": "title: One Of The Better Seat Cushions I Have Tried To Date\ntext: I have been looking for a seat cushion.  Some of the ones I have tried are so thin, they don't do much.  Others are great, but they are so small they are built more for tiny people or children with small rear ends.  Then there is the cushion that guarantees not to flatten out.  Fred Flintstone would have like THAT one.  Let's take a look at this cushion.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This cushion literally does have a dark blue covering but there is mesh where the gel part shows through.  It is pretty strong mesh, though.  The fabric on the outside is pretty tough- not velvety, thankfully.  It is like a very thick double knit.  The bottom of the cushion is slip resistant and it actually works as compared to others.<br /><br />CUSHION SHAPING<br />This cushion has shaping to it which allows for the buttocks to fit on the cushion and it also has a curve cut out so that the tail bone is not having pressure on it.  The front is not too high or sloped so that it is comfortable to sit on.<br /><br />HANDLE<br />There is a fabric webbed handle that you can carry the cushion with you, so if you plan to move it around, it makes it easier to carry with other things in your hands.<br /><br />COMFORT<br />This is way more comfortable than the Fred Flintstone cushion that I most recently got.  It gives, but is not so soft that it will be flat in a week.  I would say that this would probably stay pretty supportive for up to a year before it might start to flatten too much to use.<br /><br />GEL<br />The gel part really does help keep cool compared to some foam cushions.  I don't think it is anything miraculous, but it is also winter.  When it is summer, I might feel differently about this.<br /><br />HEIGHT<br />The height of this is about right.  It is not too thick so you can not use it in a car, but it is not so thin that it is not much good.  It is about 2 inches at its widest.<br /><br />WHERE HAVE I USED THIS AT?<br />I have used this in the car, on a recliner, hard dining room chair, and on a desk chair that is too hard for me.  It worked well in all of the locations and I was happy that it did not slide around easily.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For use in the house, car, or even wheelchair, this cushion is a good one so far.  It won't last for YEARS, but it will last a good amount of time if you need to use it constantly.  It stays put, has just enough give to it, and is shaped well for longer periods of sitting.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  I like this one.  I was going to give it to my daughter for her car, but I think I might have to get her another one.  This one works better than the others I have tried so far.  I hope it lasts quite a while.  I like it.",

            "question": "title: My Rating For These Is Two Fold Opposite- Please Read To See Why\ntext: WARNING: This is a rather in depth review of these pencils.  I am reviewing them from two points of view- beginners/kids/coloring book fans and professional level artists.  If you prefer a brief summary, see section marked THE BOTTOM LINE<br />-------------------------------------------------------<br />To start off with, I am an artist.  I use a HUGE range of professional top of the line pencils, bottom of the line, and everything in between.  If there is a brand of pencils out there in a well known name, I have probably used them and most likely own some or all of them.  I would list them all, but I don't want to bore you.<br /><br />This review will be from the dual perspective of a new artist, kids, and hobbyists and then as a professional level artist.<br /><br />WHAT ARE THESE PENCILS LIKE?<br />These pencils are colored on the entire barrel with whatever color the lead is.  There are no numbers or color names on the pencils so there is no way to refer to them if you were trying to note which ones you were using to someone else.<br /><br />BOX<br />The box is a hinged metal tin box and it closes pretty tightly to keep the pencils protected.<br /><br />TRAYS<br />The trays in the box are flimsy.  They have grabbing indents in them, but they are just not practical for using so I transferred them to a colored pencil case with elastic bands to hold in all of the pencils for easier use.<br /><br />PENCIL COLORS<br />The colors in this set are gorgeous.  There is a nice range, although if you are into grays, there are very few so that might be a concern for you.  There are quite a few browns, brights, blues, greens, orange, yellow and reds.<br /><br />QUALITY OF LEAD<br />Here is where I have to get you to pay attention to my review.  The leads in these pencils are bright, strong, and lay down on paper pretty well.<br /><br />LEAD QUALITY FOR BEGINNERS<br />For beginners, the leads in these pencils are beautiful, great assortment and will perform beautifully for most coloring books, art projects, or introductory colored pencil use for kids or older beginners.<br /><br />LEAD QUALITY FOR ARTISTS/PROFESSIONALS<br />Now the colors in this set are beautiful, BUT there is a heavy waxy in these.  That means that you can lay down a layer or two but after that, it becomes very waxy.  That means waxy bloom really fast.  So, if you are the type of person that likes to layer colors to get a lot of depth, these will not work well for that.  In fact, this is probably the most waxy colored pencil set I have yet.  The pigments are beautiful, but the waxy tendencies are these are best for few layers and just basic laying down of color.<br /><br />DO THESE SHARPEN WELL?<br />These pencils do sharpen well.  they don't seem to break easily and the colors do lay down nicely at first.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />If you are a hobbyist or have kids who really want to do some nice art with colored pencils, this set is a nice set.  The colors are beautiful and the range is fantastic.  If you are an artist who uses a lot of layers, these are probably not going to be what you want unless you plan to use a solvent with them.<br /><br />In any case, I highly recommend getting a \"book style\" colored pencil case to keep these in if you decide to buy them as the trays are too flimsy for use.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />For hobbyists and kids, FIVE STARS.<br />For artists and professionals  TWO STARS.<br /><br />Average rating comes out to be THREE STARS.  These are nice for coloring books when I don't want to waste my really good pencils but still want beautiful colors. I will use them a lot for my down time.<br /><br />PHOTO<br />In this photo with my review, I have posted the same three similar colors (some are layers of more than one) from some of the sets of colored pencils that I have.  I have labeled them accordingly.  I have tried to get the photo as accurate as I can, and I think you can see the differences well enough, despite how hard it is to capture on camera.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE",

I used to buy them at Walmart's Checkout Displays. But there were only four pens in the pack. I went through those pretty quickly with all the writing I do. These pens were so smooth they made writing effortless for my nerve damaged hand.<br /><br />Buying them in a 12 pack was much more advantageous. Less trips to the store, cheaper cost, more pens to use over a longer period of time. I love how easy it is to write both in cursive and to print on my Wide spaced Steno notepads. They make me want to write even more. There's just not enough hours in the day, but I make sure to use them at home, at work, in the car, sitting on the porch, upstairs and downstairs.<br /><br />Some people don't like the thicker body pens or the Bold 1.6mm pen point. Being retractable keeps them from staining my hands, or any porous surface like bedding, upholstery, and clothing. If you give them a try and know ahead of time the pen's lines and body are thicker, but lighter weight you will love it.<br /><br />I recommend them with a huge smile of contentment :0)",

The caps fit tight.<br /><br />HOW THESE PERFORM<br />These perform very well.  No, I did not try ALL of them, but I did try half of the ones in the first package and all worked very well.  They are easy to read and erase and work perfectly for everyone who has used them.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is a great set of dry erase markers to have on hand.  I use a different color for each person and so far they have worked great.  My family loses things a lot, so this set is perfect for us.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.

There are a few very useful/thoughtful features that make this set stand out. This is a lanyard with a safety release, the release is a hard plastic, but you are free to adjust the placement of that release anywhere you like. This will keep you from getting hurt if the lanyard is caught in equipment. There is also a retractable reel to hold the badge. That alone stretches my entire arm's length, so along with the additional length of the lanyard, it can go a long way and it reels back very smoothly. My favorite feature of this set is the ID badge sleeves. They seal, which is wonderful for me since I am often frequenting scrub sinks at work. I splash water all over myself constantly, along with occasional sprays from other sources.... now, since my badges are sealed, they are going to stay in excellent condition and I can wipe the sleeve easily. Six sealable sleeves are included in the set.<br /><br />This set is a really great value. It's good quality and I really would pick this style over others I have tried, which have been many over the years. I highly recommend this to anyone that needs their ID badge visible and handy.

I also teach online classes and needed a way to hold a computer off my lap (because I had a lap desk that has a padded back, but it was uncomfortable).  This one worked perfectly!  There really wasn't much to do other than take it out of the box, pull the legs in to a standing position, and figure out how high I wanted it.  Honestly, I really loved that I could put my phone at the front of the desk in the holder there, then angle the desk down a bit so I could comfortably type.  I also have used it to read on my kindle.  Again, I had a type of lap holder, but it wasn't comfortable with my surgery.  The desk was a nice substitute so that I could read comfortably.<br /><br />I get that not everything needs to be made more comfortable, but for my work and my surgery, it served a great multipurpose.  I can also see using it for my aging mother if I need to step in more as a caretaker and need to bring her meals, etc.  Overall, it's great planning for the future and for unforseen events.

It is by far the best i've used for small paperbacks, but book holders are really more handy for things that are unwieldy to hand hold - art books, anthologies, etc.<br /><br />So, yeah - this is the best of its kind, which isn't saying much. It feels cheap and slightly fragile, though less so than any other I've tried, excepting a stainless steel holder my wife found at a kitchen store (not that it's a good holder - just _sturdy_).<br /><br />For me the best combo available in 2021 is this book stand, plus any of the big, wooden ones with rubber-tipped, spring steel arms to hold the book open. That duo covers my needs closer to satisfactorily than anything else I've tried.<br /><br />Maybe it would be useful to say something about why am I still messing with paper codices when I have extremely convenient alternatives in the digital realm, e.g. Zotero + PDF.<br /><br />I haven't reasoned it all out, but I can say for sure that paper is durable in a way that digital stuff won't be any time soon - maybe they will invent durable digital media, maybe if Wall Street or the military wants it? Anyway, if someone 100 years from now is in the right place - a used bookstore, an estate sale, a thrift store - they might find the very books that I'm reading today. The Kindle books I \"bought\" 2 years ago have already evaporated and it would take some work on my end to find them again.<br /><br />So that's a big part of it. I like to think I'm making a teensy contribution to the preservation of the printed word during a time when the idea of its unimportance is spreading like a gasoline fire - the way bad ideas do...<br /><br />Also my experience of reading a physical book is different. Aesthetically, sure, but there's more to it than that. Like I said, I haven't thought this through, but there's something there. Nostalgia, sure. Maybe just that it's not a video screen, which maybe is permanently tainted ignoble in my mind - by association with entertainment and \"social\" media?<br /><br />IDK the text is never the dream, and the medium is never the text.

            "question": "title: Better for small business than a home office.\ntext: I wanted to love this printer, and for the price (and it being a Samsung), I really thought I would. BUT...not so much. It's HUGE, far too large for typical home/family desk use, and was incredibly heavy to move from place to place until we found an appropriate spot for it. Our unit didn't come with a set-up CD, so we labored through some frustration trying to get it set up on our wireless and for use with our two desktop computers. The connectivity has been ok so far, and the printing is lightning fast. The on-board screen is not all that intuitive, which has made using its other functions (scanning, copying, etc) not as quick or easy. The unit comes with your first set of toner cartridges, but we were astounded at the price to replace them once we're through with these. Perhaps I am just the wrong customer for this kind of printer - we need it primarily for home office use, but it seems perhaps more suited for a small business. And for a home office, we have used and loved far cheaper printers (especially the HP Envy) that still have all the multi-function capabilities, including the cloud/mobile printing, but are far more user-friendly. We'll stick with those instead!",

The concept is great, portable pads.  The adhesive is very secure, very important.  There is an easy peel strip and you have the ability to grasp the edge easily, without searching and searching for the strip to remove.<br /><br />What I don't like is that TO/FROM format.  The From section is directly over the TO section, and that can cause confusion since many people don't read well.  In other words, with carelessness, you might get your package sent back to you if one doesn't read carefully.  Maybe the TO:  and FROM could be in larger font, especially the TO.  Other than that, the pad is great.  Easy to use (for handwriting only, no printer).  If you want to attached clear labels to it, there is sufficient space, but these are specifically for handwriting.<br /><br />Product Description:<br />- 3\" x 4\"<br />- Rectangle<br />- Light Blue<br />- Permanent-Adhesive<br />- 40 Sheets<br />- 1 Label per Sheet<br />- 40 Total Labels<br /><br />Easy to use, compact and neat.

I have to store them in the garage.  I've been storing them in [[ASIN:B002ORQ0QU Rubbermaid Storage Tubs]], but the tubs (1) don't let me see the stock on hand; (2) need unpacking whenever I need to remove something (a single roll of plastic food storage bags, for example); and (3) are heavy to move around when filled.<br /><br />It makes perfect sense to store paper products--which are constantly being used up, and replaced--in a rolling wire cart like this one.  The four divided sections are very tall and capacious, and the cart holds a lot of paper products.  Best of all, when the cart is filled, it can be placed anywhere in the garage, because if it's blocking something it can be rolled out of the way.<br /><br />This particular wire cart took me about 90 minutes to assemble.  Snapping each clip onto a pair of steel wires required a fair amount of hand strength, and this was almost beyond my capacity.  I did find that once the clips were attached to the wires, they were easy to remove with pliers, to correct the occasional mistake.  The wire parts are easy to identify, and the assembly instructions are adequate.  However, it would help if the drawings showed more clearly where the 42 clips should be positioned.",

Keep the old ratty ones with holes or stains because they can be cut to the shape of this eraser and stuck to the textured area under the existing microfiber.

This product is TERRIBLE. I have not used more than a few inches of tape before the tape gets twisted, or breaks. The white material does not come off the tape. The little bits of white that do come off the tape are cracked and not cohesive. The tape comes out too far and you can not wind it back up, then the tape breaks. There is no way to open the container easily to rewind the tape. I have used similar correction tape in a professional office situation and have never encountered a situation with a brand name tape dispenser. I will never purchase this product again or recommend it. It will only be the name brand tape for me going forward.",

It's a bit bigger than the previous printer, but this does have some newer features.<br /><br />One of my pet peeves with a lot of electronic purchases these days are the lack of printed instructions, but the setup with this was rather easy thanks to the install program. Relatively speaking, it didn't take too long to get it up, running and connected to the wi-fi (don't plan on this taking ten minutes as you're not just connecting cables here). I love not having to get up and constantly flip down the paper tray, like I used to do all the time w/ my older Canon model.

            "question": "title: LIFTING HANDLE ON THE SHREDDING HEAD IS A REAL PLUS\ntext: The best feature of this shredder is that it has a handle to lift off the shredding head so you can easily empty the bin.  I have always struggled removing the shredding heads and have nearly dropped one a few times.  The handle only requires one hand lets you get a good grip on it and makes it so easy.  Shredders are noisy in general, but this one is reasonably quiet.  It has the added feature of a slot for CD/DVD shredding and you can also shred plastic credit cards.  I didn't try shredding 12 sheets that it is supposed to handle.  I noticed that most shredders work a lot better if you don't try to use them at full capacity.  This does seem powerful enough to do 12 pages at once, if you want to do that.  Amazingly this comes with a complete 12 page manual, explaining the features of the shredder, maintenance, trouble shooting and warnings. There is also a separate one page troubleshooting guide.  These days manuals are a rarity, so I think that is a real plus.  Well designed machine.  So what's not to like?  Even though this is a crosscut shredder the pieces are a little bigger than with my prior shredder. It still does an adequate job of shredding, but would have liked to see smaller pieces.  Also, the waste bin is a little small and will require emptying more often than my previous shredder that has a much larger bin.  Overall, this is a great medium duty shredder and I like it a lot.",

They have extra phones now in rooms that never before had them - they aren't likely to use these often, but the extras mean the ringtone is playing from more places in the house and they are hearing it more often!

This is mostly true, but it does tend to slip off the spool holder very easily, so I really have to be mindful of the angle I'm using to grasp the tape and tear so it doesn't slip off the spool. The finish on the wood does no favors to help the tape grip onto the tearing plate. It often will just wrap back onto the roll. Washi is a low-tack tape, so if the wood was left unfinished, it would have a better surface to grip. I also got one splinter the first time I used it, so it could use a bit more sanding before being sent to customers. It comes with a fabric bag, I'm not sure why...... I like the idea and presentation of this tape holder, but there is certainly some room for improvements. I will use this tape holder until I find one that functions better for me. I like the drop-in spool style much better for one-hand tape dispersion. Thank you for reading my review. I hope you find my experience helpful to you, and you kindly will click the button below.",

HP still makes some of the very best printers on the market, though others have gained a lot of ground on them and the choices are no longer cut and dry. HP's OfficeJet Pro X451 is a new high-speed inkjet printer that is designed to replace color laser printers. It is not an all-in-one device - it is just a printer - but what it does, it does very well.<br /><br />Before I get too deep into this, there is something that merits mention - do not confuse the terms \"wireless printer\" and \"WiFi printer\". This printer is a wireless printer - it is not set up for WiFi connectivity and as such it requires a wired connection, either to an individual system, an Ethernet wall port or a direct connection to a switch or router. \"Wireless\" in this case means that the printer is accessible over a network and does not need to be directly connected to the system. This is the wrong printer to buy if you want it connected to a WiFi network and want to move it around without connecting to an Ethernet port somewhere.<br /><br />Setup was easy but it took a long time. Once the printer was unpacked I followed the directions that came with it for installing the ink cartridges and loading paper. I turned it on and it prompted for a few set-up options and then launched into the longest calibration cycle I have ever seen - 8 separate stages of calibration and 8 sheets of paper later it was finally ready to use.<br /><br />The printer comes with a CD for installing the drivers and printer management software needed for interfacing with this printer. I used a USB connection and found that the printer was not recognized before it finished calibration (which makes sense except that the printer pauses in between stages of calibration and then resumes, so it was not clear that it was done). To install, there are two options - download the latest and greatest drivers directly from HP or use what's on the CD that came with it. I downloaded the latest drivers and the process was relatively quick.<br /><br />Once all set up, the printer was more than eager to please and I made some good observations. First, this is a really quiet printer. I have never had a printer that operates so quietly when printing. If you need a quiet printer that does not wake the whole office when it prints, this is a good printer.<br /><br />Second, I found that the print quality is phenomenal. I printed a large and detailed picture on plain paper and the result was nothing short of great. The color balance is there and the details are clean and crisp. There's little about which to complain when looking for quality output but if you really want mind-blowing prints, put in photo paper and specify as much in the print preferences - the results on photos are spectacular, suitable for framing and mounting. I do not know yet how well the brightness and clarity will hold over time, though - many inkjet prints fade with time and I do not know how well HP's inks will maintain their integrity for finished prints.<br /><br />Finally, this is a FAST printer. Inkjets as a whole have gotten faster without losing quality, and HP definitely has put some effort into squeezing speed from this printer. The advertised speed of this printer is approximately 35 ppm for black prints, and in draft mode that is probably pretty close. I did not send a large multi-page job to it for testing so I cannot really quantify the speed, but it definitely is faster than most other inkjets I have used in the past.<br /><br />This is a very solid and sturdy printer. It was made to last for years under a reasonably heavy load and it should serve an office environment without too much trouble. I do wonder how long the ink will hold out once I get through the initial cartridges, though. I do not yet have a good measure for this yet.<br /><br />The HP OfficeJet Pro X451 is a solid and well-designed inkjet that is intended for moderate office use. It is a solid printer that prints fast and generates very high-quality output, and it does this very quietly compared to most other printers. If you have a medium-sized office and you want the quality of a color laser but don't want the expense, this may very well be the printer to meet your needs.",

They make me feel a little nostalgic.<br /><br />With 75 folders per package, you have what you need to organize lots of paper.

Screw that plate into the wall, and then the spring screws back in similar to how keys go on a keychain (fish the edge of the spiral in and twist). Now that I know, it would be really easy to install another one. Maybe others already know this from experience, but personally I found it difficult for a newbie to figure out.",

            "question": "title: Very Good Mechanical Pencil\ntext: I have for years preferred mechanical pencils to traditional wood pencils as mechanical pencils typically stay sharper and I can get finer lines with them. My instrument of choice is a Uni-Ball KuruToga which I have been using for almost 4 years now and even bought another for my wife.  I was interested in trying this Zebra mechanical pencil and comparing it to my KuruToga. It compares well and is not particularly expensive.<br /><br />This pencil has a nice hand feel to it and I can hold it and work with it without any more fatigue than when I use any other pencil. The barrel is ridged hard plastic so it is easy to grip, though I personally prefer a pencil that has a softer (rubberized) grip to make it even more comfortable.<br /><br />The innovation with this pencil is the spring loaded barrel which is designed to absorb excess pressure and prevent the lead from breaking as easily. In use, it seems to work fairly well and I have had fewer breaks than with many other pencils I have used. When you bear down hard, you can actually see the spring in the tip of the pencil compress to absorb some of the pressure. I cannot say with certainty that this is the only reason that the leads break less – the leads themselves may be a contributor.<br /><br />The main area for improvement with this pencil is the eraser, which is very small and is typical of a lot of the better mechanical pencils I have seen and used. If you plan to use this pencil a lot, plan to keep a larger eraser close by which is easier to use anyway.<br /><br />The cost of this pencil is quite reasonable. As I write this it sells here for $7, which is not terribly expensive. While disposable mechanical pencils may cost less, they quality is usually not there and in the long run you end up paying a little more than you would for a good quality pencil in the first place.<br /><br />My wife has confiscated this pencil from me and uses it now. She prefers it to the KuruToga, though I am still debating which I think is better. Regardless, this is a fine pencil and it will serve you well if you need a 0.5mm pencil that will not cost you a fortune.",

Even with this issue, the writing seems perfect and the ink is a soft sapphire, easy on the eyes and the pen writes like a dream. I'm writing out all my recipes with these refills and they look wonderful.

In the past the Daily Box Calendar captured that diversity of types of coats. So when I purchased not only one but two calendars one for home and one for my office it was in anticipation of seeing several Wirehaired Dachshunds like my little Miniature girl each month.<br /><br />I was shocked when in trying to show someone at work the difference between the coats and I could only find ONE Wirehaired in the entire calendar! What?! And there were only several Longhaired Dachshund pictures out of over 300 pictures...Really?!!<br /><br />The calendar consists of mostly Smooths. Which is fine if Dachshunds weren't so diverse. So if you're a Smoothie owner and Dachshund lover you will enjoy the entertaining photos very much. The pictures are beautiful and depict the antics of silly & serious Doxies.<br /><br />I just wish there were more Wirehaired and Longhaired Dachshunds to enjoy with their Smooth brethren. It's like a owner of a Chocolate Lab purchasing a Daily Box Labrador Retriever calendar and finding mostly Black with only a couple Yellow Labs and the picture of ONE Chocolate Lab. They love all Labs but it's so great to see your variety represented too.<br /><br />I plan to give my second Daily Calendar to one of the many Smooth Dachshund owners I see while I'm out with my little Wirehaired. Someone who loves Dachshunds as much as I do, who will love & enjoy a calendar that depicts their low long baby in all it's tail wagging happiness.Of course I am keeping one of the calendars because though I have a coat preference I am still a Dachshund Devotee.

            "question": "title: Easy Assembly, Cheap Price, Not a Permanent Solution\ntext: I received a 6 pack of boxes which are really 6 individual and deep file drawers.  Each box is assembled with 3 separate pieces of cardboard with the instructions on the back of the file drawer.  Also included is one metal square rod to reinforce each of the 6 file drawer casings.  In addition, there are 12 plastic rails; 2 rails slip onto each file drawer for use in storing hanging files.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Easy assembly<br />- Boxes can be used for hanging files with supplied plastic rails<br />- Somewhat sturdy considering that they are just boxes<br />- Can be used for more than just files; for instance I would use these as cheaper and much sturdier versions of moving boxes whose only drawback would be that they might be somewhat awkward to carry but are very easy to open and close.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- The 6-pack is actually 6 individual and separate file drawers<br />- The box says that the drawers can stack 5 high with the interlocking clips (which are not included and which I assume must be purchased separately)<br />- The file drawer part has a \"Panel A\" piece that says to detach for additional support but there are no instructions on how to use it.  I guessed on how to install this piece but I can't be sure if I correctly used it to reinforce the handle located in the back of the file drawer.<br />- In order to reduce the shifting of the file boxes during use, I had to put it against a wall. Although it still shifted without the interlocking clips, it worked effectively enough as file storage.<br /><br />In summary, I would only consider purchasing these boxes as temporary file storage or as very basic moving boxes that are cheaper (at the current price of $20.57 for 6) than regular moving boxes. Without the interlockinig clips, I would stack these boxes 5 high ONLY if set against a corner and back wall where they are supported on two sides by the walls and on the third side by some furniture.<br /><br />I do not consider these boxes sturdy enough to use for permanent file storage where the files are frequently accessed.  They are a good solution, however, for permanent file storage where files are accessed infrequently such as for old cases in a law firm or police, library, banking or other personal records.",

I mean all we use these for is keeping one around to keep notes and ideas down on and I keep another in a faux leather folio I use for grocery shopping. I used to clip a pen (to mark off the things I'd bought) to an older pad and that tore the sheets. I find it far easier to write on these white pages (our previous were yellow and school/wide ruled) with their much smaller college rule lines. This dozen pack of pads are going to last us for years. The price was good, the quality is fine. The sheets are microperforated and tear out clean and easy. Couldn't ask for anything more.",

The first project is stickers that are printed from my home printer. The second is to adhere the film onto mylar film to place on the face of button badges. These are turning out really great. This is a great film to use on a variety of paper crafts. I do advise to use a soft squeegee and lay the film very gently and make sure no air is trapped.

The neoprene seems pretty protective, but I wouldn't go dropping the item on a hard floor or anything purposely. I do think it would help protect it if it happened though, the foam seems thick enough to cushion the scanner.  I still think for the price it is a really good value for your money, especially when comparing the the much more expensive bag advertised with the scansnap from Fujitsu which is about twice the price, and it doesn't appear to be any larger than the COSMOS ® Black Color Neoprene Carrying Travel Case for Fujitsu ScanSnap S1300i Mobile Document Scanner.",

I've labeled a dozen jars of buttons, and about 50 file labels for my collection of craft paper pads (I make hand-crafted greeting cards).  I'm still on the first set of batteries AND the original label cassette.  No problems at all.<br /><br />I'm really impressed with the variety of label designs, as well as the \"special characters\" that come standard with this.  You get a cassette of 1/2\" white tape/black ink, and I'm finding the print to be crisp and clear.  I've done a few labels with just one line, but most are 2-line labels, and the print is clear and easy to read.  Operation isn't difficult at all, once you \"get\" how to cycle through the options on the machine itself.  The screen is not backlit, so you need to use this where there's enough light to read the screen.<br /><br />I like that it doesn't waste a lot of tape, either.  It seems to allow about 3/8\" on either side of the printing.  My old label maker left at least 1/2\" on either side, so this is definitely an improvement.<br /><br />My next investment might be a power cord, but honestly, if the batteries continue to last as long as these seem to be, I don't think I'll actually need it.<br /><br />Very happy with this!",

I use my printer but not all that much because these toner cartridges are truly crappy and just scatter and bleed ink everywhere on the paper. So, I only finally went through the first cartridge last week. Since I have two printers, I do have some choices, fortunately. I was really hoping to use this one more, but I can really only use this printer for printing out personal stuff. Like ebooks that I don't want to read off my screen, but prefer to print out to read in the living room or dining room or elsewhere. As far as that kind of printing goes, it's mostly legible. Just waaay not clean enough to use formally or professionally.<br /><br />I waited until I was on my second cartridge before writing this review. I figured, maybe the first cartridge was just a lemon - that can happen... I did not try to exchange it at the time because I bought these before my original cartridge ran out, just to have backup ready. By the time that happened and I realized that the new cartridge was crap, it was really too late to raise the issue. I bought it from Blake Printing Supply at the time but, since I never tried to return them or even complain, I can't speak to their service or responsiveness in this situation.<br /><br />The second cartridge I started on last week seems about 70% better than the first one. Still not clean enough for formal applications, but less frustrating for my personal printing needs.<br /><br />So, if you're OK with having a cheap cartridge that makes your paper dirty, but still can print out your personal stuff relatively legibly, then go for it. If you want it for an office environment, or for printing out your new manuscript, stay far away from it.",

Some photo paper prints their name on the back (the non-glossy side) which always bothered me as I sometimes use my photos to mail as cards or write personalized messages on the back. You can do that with these, thankfully, because the rear is blank.<br />I'm happy with them and would recommend it.",

I eventually got the paper out but it had 3-4 staples in it. I tried fixing the stapler by pulling it apart, but could not. The staple head was stuck to the bottom and I could not get it loose. I eventually had to just replace with another in the pack. I'm hoping this does not happen again because a week's worth per stapler doesn't really work. I adjusted my review from 4 to 3 stars.<br /><br />This item is made with good quality is and is very sturdy. Inserting the staples was easy because you dont have to open the entire top like a traditional stapler. You press the orange button on the back and the compartment pops out. You put the staples on top of that and push it back in. You can press to staple too, rather than picking the entire thing up to do so. It is also strong and can push through a lot of paper.",

They are easy to spot on the shelf, but they are smooth, easy to wipe off, but unique so I can find them too.<br /><br />PAGES<br />The pages inside are pretty thick.  They have a date area at the top if you choose to use this as a journal, and lines which are more like college ruled than the super wide lines.  Don't try to use Sharpies in them, but they will stand up to ink pretty well without bleed through as long as it does not soak the page.<br /><br />BINDING<br />If you break the book in gradually a few pages at a time to loosen the binding, these books will lay flat on a table top.  There is a thread sewn through the center of the pages in the book too.<br /><br />RIBBON<br />There is a red ribbon in the book for page marking.  For my recipe book, it is a perfect addition too as well as journals.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This set of two books is perfect for my recipes.  The binding is nice, the covers tough, and the pages are thicker to help with spillage and re-use.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  These are just what I was wanting.

These arrived to me well-packaged and in great condition. I really like the fan-folded labels as they fit perfectly in my label feeder and print with good quality. I have not found the stack sticking together after using this for several months. Sometimes, failed prints are due to the quality of the labels, not the printer. That being said, it is very important to know how to use your printer to have good-quality prints. I find it's always worth my time to print sample labels when I re-load the machine or after it has been unused for several days. It's important to use good quality labels.<br /><br />I will certainly re-order when my currently supply is depleted. They stick securely to poly-bags, cardboard, poster-board and over top of shipping tape. I am sending more packages to family and friends over the past several months as I do not see them in-person as often. This helps my doll collecting club still be able to do some of our crafting projects together, and share supply kits for the workshops we used to do at our in-person meetups. Shipping labels also are great for me as I can print directly from the site where I pay for postage. I can also prepay postage, print a label and send it family and friends to use on packages they send back to me. I use these with my at-home label printer to avoid spending time in lines at the Post Office. I've had no issues with these feeding well into my thermal printer, and find them to be a good value.

The nib has a different design that only comes with this pen (replacement nibs are more plain looking). It's cosmetic, but it looks cool on the pen. The packaging is great, no problems with believing this is legit. Comes with the cardboard band, and there is a slight blue ink to the nib which is what is expected. (Lamy always uses blue ink to test each nib in the factory, if they don't have it, it's a fake for sure). The pen is a little heavier than the Lamy Safari, and the only complaint I have is when posting the cap, it makes it feel a little top heavy. For me it's enough weight that annoys me and I have to take it off to write. I ordered the Palladium, and looking at different websites, some make it look like a pearl white, others more silver.

I like that, but some kids do not because it takes more effort and they can sometimes tear the paper.  With bright and pretty colors and contrasting interior dyed wood, these look good enough to draw a rainbow, but the pencil leads are all the same gray and without color.  Once the kids get beyond their  initial surprise, these pencils are likely to become a favorite because chances are that they will not be lifted by a classmate.  The white eraser is attached without metal, a feature I personally like, and the eraser reminds me of the larger ones I regularly use.  I love these pencils, but because of the confusion they create, I have to deduct a star from the review.  I think this package would be a great gift for teachers who usually keep pencils on hand and wonder at the end of the day where they have gone.  They are also great for rewards.",

YOu also fo not get the automatic slide feed everyone wants.<br /><br />Out of the package, the unit worked well.  I selected the correct holder for my slides, inserted my SD card (not included with unit!), set the film type (35 mm slide) and resolution, and started.  While there is no autofeed, it is pretty easy to push the slides through manually.  Positioning is helped by the LCD monitor, but I found it is not perfect.  Expect some cut-off and some rounded corners with mounted slides.<br /><br />I tried adjusting the brightness because many of my old slides were a bit overexposed.  I found little benefit, so I went with the defaults and made adjustments in Photoshop instead.  For reasonably well exposed slides, the defaults work well.<br /><br />Picture quality was up and down.  When I looked at some of the slides that appeared fuzzy or granular when I went to 100%m the originals appeared okay at 5X.  On the other hand, I had several that were very sharp and well focused.  I am still trying to decide if it is the Scanza or the slides.<br /><br />Color saturation was a bit variable.  Older, overexposed slides seemed to be lacking color and contrast even in good areas.  Well-exposed slides were saturated with no obvious problems.<br /><br />If you are interested in converting your slides to snapshots for on-screen slideshows and sharing, the Scanza is a good option.  You can go through a few hundred slides in a day and get good results pretty easily.  If you have many more, you should be considering a professional scanner.  If you only have a few, I would try your scanner, if it has a suitable capability.<br /><br />While branded Kodak, it is a Chinese product.

I have used paper journals, though, and I prefer leather-bound ones to cardboard-covered. I was interested in this journal and I am mostly pleased with it though there is some room for improvement.<br /><br />The cover is pressed leather and is very pretty, and the outside of the cover looks pristine. Inside, the leather looks hand-cut and is uneven. It isn’t a problem but it shows that the journal is hand-crafted.<br /><br />The paper is interesting to me. I have made paper by hand, and it has a very rough feel to it and is speckled with imperfections. The paper in this journal has the same qualities of hand-made paper. While it does make this journal feel more “rustic”, it does mean the paper is harder to write on. It’s workable but it does mean that more care and effort is required when writing.  There are things that can be done to smooth the paper out a bit, and this doesn’t appear to have been done in the production process.<br /><br />This is a nice little journal but unless you’re willing to accept its imperfections and prefer a more “commercial” journal it will disappoint. The paper is slightly rough, and the cover shows signs of hand craftmanship, both of which are not necessarily bad things unless you’re more interested in the actual writing process.",

            "question": "title: Decent printer, but can be difficult to set up.  Ink is too expensive.\ntext: Stylish and attractive with a somewhat small footprint and reasonably quiet operation.  It is not really fast printing, but adequate.  Printing starts right away, which was not the case with one printer that I own that takes forever to start printing.  Making a copy is very easy; just put your page face down on the glass and press the copy button.  Unfortunately, there is no sheet feeder for copying or scanning multiple pages, so it is a page at a time.  If you do a lot of page scanning or copying, you need a printer with a sheet feeder, but you will pay a lot more for that convenience.  There is no button on the printer panel to use to scan a document; you have to use software for that.  The driver for the printer, scanning software and manual must be downloaded from a website given in the instructions.  It makes some sense to me not to have the software included, as these things change over time and having it online ensures you get the latest version when you install but that does make a little more difficult for the novice.  Also until you download and check the user's guide, you really don't have a clue on how to scan.  The software installs a program simply called &#34;scanning&#34; on your Windows PC and you run that to scan.  One of the first things I did not like about this printer is that there are only two ink cartridges; one for black and one for color.  I have never liked that because if you run out of just one color, you have to replace the whole color cartridge.  The printer has an &#34;ECO&#34; button you can press that puts out less ink to help you save on ink when you don't need the very best quality, so that's something that can help save on ink.  The ink is a very pricey, so not sure this would be as economical as printers that have 4 or more ink cartridges  This only has color and black and the cartridges shipped with the printer did not last very long..  If you want to use this on USB, rather than wireless, a USB cable is not included, so if you don't have a spare around, you have to buy one.  After you download the software, you have to run it and apparently connect a USB cable initially, even if you are going to use it wireless.  You are given a choice in the install as to whether you want to go wireless or with USB.  On one computer I had trouble with either option; it kept telling me to attach a USB cable that was already attached.  I investigated and found out that the printer was showing up in Windows and I could use it with USB.  As far as wireless, there are two options; either with a WPS button or manual where you enter your router information.  On one computer, neither option worked, even after multiple attempts; I could not get wireless to work at all.  I tried connecting the printer to another computer and both the USB option and the manual setup for wireless worked perfectly on the first try.  I could not get the WPS option to work, even on the second computer.  Since the manual setup worked, I didn't need to.  (If you don't know, WPS is a button you press on your router and then you press a button on the printer within two minutes and it is supposed to connect automatically).  Was going to contact support about the wireless problem, but since I got it working with manual settings on one computer, I didn't call.  If you are not somewhat computer literate, this is not the best printer for you to try to set up; you might struggle with it for a while.  This printer also is supposed to be able to scan remotely with your smartphone with a free app that you can download from the app store, but I did not test that capability, as it seemed to me to be of limited value.",

            "question": "title: Not Worth It\ntext: This product has a neat idea, but a poor implementation.  First off, you have to scan a QR code to find out the website address where you download their app (they really couldn't be bothered to type it out).  Then you have to download the app and sideload it because they didn't want to publish through the app store.  If you haven't done this before, it involves turning off several security features in your phone.  Next, you have to turn off the \"avoid bad wifi connections\" feature if you have that turned on (in advanced wifi settings on an Android).  Then you can finally use the app.  After doing all of that (and against my better judgement) I tried this out and found out that it only prints one color at a time, and the ink cartridge they included was yellow.  A yellow which barely shows up on white paper, and looks like a stain from popcorn oil on my skin.  It doesn't show up at all on anything else.  So if they had included a better color I might have been able to tell you how the printouts look, but as it is I can only tell you about the myriad of other flaws and not about the one main thing that I would have liked to be able to tell you about.  I'm now left debating about whether I want to go to the expense of getting a better cartridge or just return this thing now before the poorly designed app is used to hack my phone.

This nib gives a hint of line variation that makes cursive much more satisfying.  I haven't tried the 1.5 nib, which I imagine would give an even greater line variation but would require a larger script size.  With the 1.1, I can write very similar size to a fine ball-point pen, but with much better looking script.<br /><br />Upon examining this italic nib carefully, I was surprised to find the tip is beveled instead of square.  This would seem to make it difficult to get fine hairlines.  I decided to start with an &#34;F&#34; nib and  grind an italic nib the way I thought it should be.  With a very sharp right-angle on the tip, I get finer hairlines and much better line width variation without an excessively wide nib.<br /><br />Although I polished the nib up to a 12000 grit stone and a strop, neither italic nib (Lamy's nor my own) are especially smooth.  The trade-off of a nib that can make fine lines is that it must be sharp and more likely to cut or tear-out paper fibers.  It can be polished further, but eventually, the sharp angle is polished off and the finest line width is widened.<br /><br />Overall, I'm pleased with the italic nibs.  I prefer my own to the one being reviewed here, but either is much more satisfying than a ball-end nib.",

            "question": "title: Protect Your Security with AmazonBasics Cross Cut Shredder\ntext: Every home and office needs a paper shredder. They are useful for destroying sensitive documents, credit cards, and other items that need to be protected from the hands/view of a potential thief. Amazon Basics has come up with a very good shredder with this unit and it’s a good choice for the home or workplace.<br /><br />One of the greatest advantages with this shredder is its size. At nearly 23 inches tall, it can be reached with ease- much more easily than the short, low-to-the-ground shredders common in most homes. It also has a large, six gallon receptacle to hold the shredded paper and plastic. This means it can go a long time between emptying.<br /><br />Another feature I like with this shredder is that it remains permanently on. That is, you don’t have to reach over and turn it on and off. You just leave it in the on position and it’s ready to shred the moment it senses a piece of paper, plastic, or CD. I also like that it’s on wheels because it glides with ease across my wood and tile floors. I can wheel it straight to the garage where a plastic bag awaits for the small bits of paper and plastic.<br /><br />As for its ability to shred, it can hold a large number of sheets. The manufacturer claims 17 and I can believe it. The cutting is cross- cut so it is shredded well enough that one will be able to read the documents. It doesn’t shred things to oblivion like some other shredders, but it shreds well enough. No one will be able to read something or piece it back together after it has been run through this shredder and that is what matters most.<br /><br />Shredders are essential for every house and office space and this Amazon Basics shredder is a very good one to consider. It rips up paper, credit cards, CD and DVD, leaving no chance for an identity thief to get your information. Its ability and price level make it a very good choice for your security needs.",

I was able to open package and put them in without any issues. I then printed a few items. and they printed well. I print coupons so I don't have time for the print not to come out clear and readable. Even though these are not the name brand they still worked as well as the name brand ones do. I love the fact that I can see how much ink is in them and I don't have to guess if I am running low or if the ink is going to run out while I am printing coupons or one of my kids are having to print something up for school. They are cheaper than the name brand ones and they work just as well. My printer recognized them as being none HP but once I clicked ok then everything was good. It reads the ink level and everything with them just fine, no issues there either. I used to refill the original HP cartridges and I would have issues with the print quality afterward. I am hoping that I can refill these with no issues, but that will be awhile from now. Either way if I am able to refill them the good thing is I will be able to see the ink and won't overfill them.I like that they come with the chips that are needed. The chips are already installed onto them, so I don't have to try and get them off of my old cartridges or buy them separate. I have printed several coupons and other items so far and the print quality is good. My coupons scan without issue. As before with the old Hp cartridges after I refilled them the coupons wouldn't always scan which was a waste of paper and ink.

Two messy looking cube storage boxes went in each of the holes, and I put my portable CD player and old cassette tape player (I still have many dozens of cassettes with irreplaceable music) on top of the cube. I still needed a little more storage for some DVDs, so I put this monitor stand on top of the cube as well. It looks really cute with the CD player on top and then the stray DVDs underneath. Gives the the whole unit a little pizazz.<br /><br />Anyway, it's very sturdy, nice looking wood, and you can store whatever in the two gaps left underneath: CDs, DVDs, a mouse or mouse pad, thumb drives, whatever.",

Even though it was shipped in a huge box I thought they'd just gone overboard with the packaging again. No, this is a nice BIG lapdesk, and, at 5 foot 2 inches tall, it is almost too big for me. If I sit down at our sofa with it, it almost comes up to my collarbone with the legs at their shortest. So if you are a tall person, you have found the perfect lap desk! Everything works perfectly, it folds up compactly (alas, not enough to go under our sofa, but under taller furniture, like a bed, for sure), and the work surface is enormous! If you were an artist trying to draw a portrait from a photograph, you can easily prop up that photo and still have plenty of room to draw on a full-sized drawing pad. There are several different angles of tilt as well.<br /><br />I'll admit I bought this because last time husband was in the hospital, we tried to do stuff like watch Amazon Prime on my laptop and it just wasn't possible with that big, awkward table they give you in the hospital. This would be perfect for sitting on the bed of someone who is bedridden or in the hospital for a long stay, so they could prop up a laptop, color for relaxation between the nurses running in and out, read, do a small craft like beading or drawing, etc. I have it; nevertheless I hope I don't have to use it for the activity it seems perfect for!",

I did receive the Pilot Prera, fine just like I ordered. The pen is lightweight as expected, posts well no issues. I really have no complaints, it's a good writer. I had no scratchiness with this nib, cleaned it and it started right up. I believe it's legit, or it's a good writing fake if it is. Everything seems to be the real deal, so glad I purchased this here, some fountain pen stores are over charging for this pen.<br /><br />The tip for those who don't know, whenever you get a new pen, use a little dish soap and water in the palm of your hand, roll the nib of the pen in the soapy water, rinse and dry well. Often manufacturers have oils left on nibs, so I always clean mine first. Then ink up, (always use a good quality ink, it absolutely makes a big difference, I like the Pilot Iroshizuku bottled inks), blot with soft rag until you get it going, and try it on different papers.<br />I had no issues with this pen but if you ever have a scratchy nib, try writing a bit with it first, good ink, different papers, sometimes it will become smoother and work itself out. If it still gives you issues, try doing some figure 8's on a brown paper bag, that might be all that's needed to help it. Too much on the nib and your fine turns into a permanent medium, so less is more.",

Basically the same though, just looks a bit different as it's Franklin Covey brand.  I actually think I like this one better.  It has a space for everything the Day Runner had, like work, Fax, Mobile, Home and Email, but that is in dark blue, so it breaks the monotony of ALL grey and I think it's a bit easier on the eyes.  At first, I rated four stars as I thought I would need extra pages, but then realized as I was comparing with my old Day Runner, that rather than doubling or even tripling up letters for one two-sided page, that these pages have a FULL two-sided page for each letter except wx and yz.  So unless you have a ton contacts for those letters, you'd probably be good with this one.",

I was keeping special colored pencils for them to use in a regular zipper pencil bag. Often they would end up taking all of the pencils out to look for that one special color that they needed. And when they did that, at least one pencil would roll off the desk. Now, they can unroll this pencil wrap and see all of the pencil color choices at once and no pencils are rolling away from them. Plus, both of the boys are particular about order and now the pencils are grouped by colors. One of the boys can't tie bows, so I end up having to tie the wrap back up, so a velcro closure would be nice, but this works fine. The wrap is well made and looks like it will withstand daily use.<br /><br />*I purchased this at a discounted price in exchange for my honest & unbiased review. My thoughts & opinions are my own.",

LOTS of them.<br /><br />There is a family joke at our house about them.  (skip if you are in a hurry)<br /><br />One time when our son was little he had a fascination with caps that you could pound rocks on and they made a popping noise.  I found them at a store (they were VERY hard to find) and with him with me, I diverted him using the cashiers as a tag team and quickly sneaked the package up to the register all paranoid that he would discover them, but he didn't.  He was hard to surprise.<br /><br />I wrapped them in a hurry too and could not wait until Christmas.  I really built up the gift to him telling him he would be SO excited.<br /><br />He saved it for last, opened it up and there was a whole collection of boxes of ...&#34;gem clip paper clips&#34;<br /><br />He said in a monotone voice, &#34;Oh wow.  Gem clips.  Yeah.  I really am excited&#34;<br /><br />I grabbed the wrong package and in my hurry to hide them never realized it.<br /><br />WHAT ARE THESE PAPER CLIPS LIKE?<br />These paperclips are just under 2 inches long.  They are sturdy and strong, but most importantly, they are polished metal.  That is important to me and let me tell you why.  There are 10 boxes of these.<br /><br />WHAT DO I USE THESE FOR ?  (I BET YOU NEVER THOUGHT OF THIS ONE)<br />Not only do I use these for holding papers together and twisting into a number of ways, but in my fish aquariums ( I have many), I use these to hold seaweed down in the tanks which don't do well with suction cup seaweed holders.<br /><br />I unbend the clip and make it into a triangle with the opening in the bottom.  I slip the folded seaweed or cucumber slice or other vegetable onto the triangle, and then bury the bottom in the gravel (or other substrate).  The piece that I slipped onto the triangle floats upward and stays where the shrimp and fish can peck at it.  When I am done, I usually throw them away before the water can cause the finish to peel off at all.  I might get two uses out of them.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />In addition to the usual uses for paper clips, I also find these invaluable for my fish tanks to provide fresh snacks for my fish and shrimp.  Because I use them only once or twice before they can corrode, I do go through them pretty quickly.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />I give these five stars.  They might not be Gem Clips, but they sure have a great finish on them and I can get two uses on them before I have to use a new one for my fish tanks.",

The controls are more user friendly, too. I love that there are two trays and they have a large capacity. My Cannon didn't hold that much paper and I would have to go refill it because a note window would pop open on my computer telling me to add more paper. The WiFi connectivity works great. I love that I don't have to turn on my printer manually before it will print. This one wakes up and starts printing. Printed pages look nice. The color pictures on some recipes that I just printed out are a little fuzzy and not clear and sharp, but the print is amazing. I was a little disappointed to learn that there's no place to insert heavy paper. I just bought some 32 weight paper to print out pages for my planner. I will have to do that on another printer.

Sometimes it's just better to store some items in cardboard as it allows airflow. Some of my paperwork was outgrowing my file, so it was time to store it away. I can't toss them in the recycling bin yet, but they definitely needed archived. This set was a perfect solution. It just was too much of a risk to trap moisture in a plastic box, as they need to go into the attic. They are the perfect size, assemble well and re-open easily with the button and string.

I have had the opportunity to review two other felt letter boards recently in this same price range.  This is the lowest quality board of all three.  The edges are unfinished and rough.  You could get a splinter if not careful.  As it is unfinished the frame is not stained as the description picture shows.  The plastic letters do not have tabs on the top and bottom of them, so when you stand the sign up the letters fall off.  Also, the slots are too wide apart so the letters do not fit in them securely.  There is a good variety of letters and punctuation marks.  The frame also does not have a standing leg on the back.  You must purchase a stand to set it up on a dresser or desk.  Overall, I was disappointed in the quality of this board.  Not one to purchase when there are others that are the same price and way better quality.",

I still find that printing items, at least certain items, is preferable to viewing them on a screen and thus I still rely on ink printers to fulfill this need. And one printer up to the task is the Canon ImageClass.<br /><br />I have owned many canon products in my day and I have found most them reliable and high quality. This printer continues my positive winning streak. Out of the box, it takes little time to set it up and once it gets going, it prints at a rapid pace, which makes it ideal for small businesses who need to print quickly. The paper tray holds up to 250 sheets, which is also a plus and more than other printers of this size.<br /><br />This printer also functions as a scanner and copier. I have used the scanner function would good success, as the document came through clear and readable. I haven’t used the copy function yet, but there is no reason to suspect that it isn’t efficient and trouble- free. Most of what I print is word documents with words and no images. The printer seems to work fine for this task.<br /><br />Canon ImageClass is reasonably compact in size, but if you need a printer to fit into a small space, this printer not work. Mine sits an open space on my desktop and it does fit, but there isn’t much remaining space on either side of it.<br /><br />Canon ImageClass MF264dw is a quiet printer so don’t worry if you have dozens of sheets to print. You likely won’t even notice. It’s a good printer overall and one I’m glad to have in my home.",

I am specifically writing this review for the 12-count box of blue 0.7mm gel pens.<br /><br />My wife does a lot of writing and she is very fussy about her pens. Her favorite pens have slowly been drying out as she uses them up, so she has been looking for new pens to replace what she has been using. I selected these, hoping they would work out for her. So far she has been happy with them.<br /><br />Normally, my wife doesn't care for gel pens in particular but she agreed to try these. Her first observation is that these dry quickly and don't smear as much as others she has tried. That's a huge plus right there. None of the ones we have tried have skipped or globbed either which is good. We also have seen no issues with bleeding through the paper. Some of the other reviewers here have complained of dried out pens and inconsistent writing, but so far we have not seen those issues with the box I have received.<br /><br />Based on our using these pens, I am happy to recommend these. They write smoothly and they smear less than other gel pens we have tried.",

Picture quality isn't perfect, but is satisfactory and probably as good as you're going to get short of using negatives for reprints.

            "question": "title: Wi-Fi Setup is Tricky, Control Panel a little difficult to get used to; otherwise a great printer\ntext: Unpacking and doing the basic printer set up and filling with ink was pretty easy.  The instruction sheet is clear and easy to understand and follow.  This printer is different than any other I have had in that it doesn't use ink cartridges, but instead uses ink tanks.  You fill each tank with the appropriate color of ink from a bottle (bottles are included to fill each color tank fully).  You can actually see the ink levels from a semi-clear window on each tank; you also can view levels from software.  Print quality seems decent with good colors.  I liked the fact that the printer is not overly large or heavy.  It has a reasonable footprint for the capability it has.  Now the negatives.  First of all, since there are tanks with ink in them, if you tip up the printer much when moving it, you could potentially spill ink out.  The tanks have covers, but not sure how secure they are; there is an obvious warning on the box not to tilt the printer after the tanks are filled.  If you wanted to ship the printer, you would have to find a way to drain the tanks.  The control panel on the printer is a little confusing until you get used to it.  I kept wanting to press the LCD display, but it is not touch screen.  You use buttons to the right of the screen to navigate.  To make a photo copy is a number of presses on the panel.  Even turning the printer off is a three step process.  Another brand of printer I have is easier to operate.  Another gripe that I have when setting up is that when you are unable to connect from your computer, if you have to end the program, you have to start all over from the beginning with a complete reinstall of software.  The only real negative to this printer is the Wi-Fi setup.  I could not get it to set up properly, until I used a USB cable.  At first I thought the problem was that my router was running at 5GHZ and not broadcasting a 2.5GHZ signal and actually ended up setting up a separate SSID for dedicated 2.5GHZ.  That did not work at all.  Finally by using the original SSID of my router, was able to connect my computer to the printer with WiFi, but ONLY by using a USB connection for the setup (USB cable is not included).  After you connect, you can remove the USB cable and then print with WiFi.  This printer only works on 2.5 GHZ and I think it is time that manufacturers start supporting 5 GHZ on their devices.  If you want to use this with WiFi, you better know a lot about your router.  Fortunately you can use the printer on a network (Ethernet cable), a USB connection or wireless.  Scanning is a little hard to figure out because you have to download and install a separate utility from the Epson website and it is not quite clear what it is that you download and install; fortunately I guessed correctly, as I got scanning to work from my computer; however, I could not get scanning to work from the printer panel.  A label on the top of the printer mentions FAX capability, but the outside box does not and apparently a different model does faxing.  As far as how long the ink lasts, I am not optimistic as the black ink has already gone down quite a bit and I have only printed about a half dozen pages.  I think once you get over the oddities of setup, this is a good printer.  A little weak on setup.  Nothing included to set it up; you have to download from the Epson website.  That's probably a good thing as you always have the most up-to-date software that way.",

After a recent round of a lot of medical/doctor/hospital visits for my husband, I found myself wuickly being overwhelmed with the sheer quantity of the bills from the hospital, doctors, radiologists, labs, etc etc.  They ALL bill separately for your part of the cost, and with Obamacare guidelines, there is no longer just one account for your name - every procedure has a new account number. I bought these to try to keep the bills, estimation of benefits, doctor bills, etc under control.  Turned out that I needed HALF of this box just to have one folder per account set up by these various entities!  Good grief.  13 different accounts for the treatment of the same medical problem!  Yikes...<br /><br />These have been invaluable to keeping up with the accounts without losing my sanity. I am also going to recommend them for my daughter to keep her projects separate for her college courses.  Don't know why I didn't think about them sooner...  I tend to associate these with office use only, but they are great for home and school as well.  Love them!",

The cards are shipped flat but with a crease, so they are fairly easy to fold and burnish so they stay folded. The surface is quite smooth, more like a manila envelope than cardstock--the paper has no real tooth. They certainly are not a heavy weight of paper (again, not cardstock weight), but they seem fine for simple day-to-day use.

Just as persnickety and error prone as the other two I had trouble with before. I had it out of the box in five minutes and the packing materials removed and plugged it in. It immediately flashed an error code saying the paper cartridge was not installed properly. I followed the directions and for fifteen minutes the screen looped from the error code to the menu and back to the error code. Meanwhile, the ink slots are frozen and the belt won't move to allow me to even try to install the ink containers. It's simply unusable at this point.<br /><br />The frozen ink holder problem is the same one I had with my first Pixma a few years ago - at least that printer waited a few months to act up.

It can roll up small, and it comes with a band to keep it rolled up.<br /><br />Desk mats can be used as mats for anything. Sturdy, water proof, light but with enough heft to stay put. Think of it like an extra wide placemat. Might be helpful in those that use a side table with occasional use for moving their mouse.

It does have an automatic stop, but that never works with colored pencils. It does have a large shavings area, so you have to empty it less often. The sharpening hole isn’t big enough to accommodate more than a standard sized pencil. The point on the pencil isn’t better than other sharpeners.

It has a little glass window in the front which is not easy to break,thankfully due to being recessed.<br /><br />There are three sections, one of which has a removable divider in it.  There is a rubberized bottom on it to keep it from sliding all over when you put things in or take them out.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?<br />I am so HAPPY!  Every single remote fits in this caddy, there is plenty of room for it on the small end table, and my remotes are all ready to be used and seen easily from across the room.  The black color means that dirt won't show up over time too.  I have five remotes in them including a BOSE which is HUGE, DISH, and then TV, DVD, Roku, and even a place for my glasses if I want to stick them in there while I am doing close work.<br /><br />The compartments are the perfect height and everything looks great in there.  I could not be happier.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This caddy is handy to have. It fits on a very small table top, does not slide around and fits even large remotes without struggle.

            "question": "title: Plan Your School Year\ntext: Electronic planners are commonplace now that we live in the information age. But there is still something to be said for a traditional planner; one that is physical with pages for writing appointments, tasks, deadlines, etc. For teachers, these traditional planners are valuable for organizing and a good one to own and use is the Teacher Planner 2020-2021.<br /><br />With this planner, you get an organizational tool that covers a full 12 month span, but rather than a calendar year, it covers 12 months that are more in line with the school year: July 2020 through June 2021. Each month has a two- page spread with the days of the month presented in squares, with five lines on each for writing things down. In addition, since this is intended for teachers, there is also a weekly calendar that covers Monday through Friday, with a larger amount of space to write down more detailed descriptions of tasks. Flip through the pages a little more and you will find a 12- month calendar for 2020 and 2021, plus a list of holidays.<br /><br />This planner is quite useful for teachers. My wife happens to be one, so I knew she would like this planner and find it helpful. She likes that each week of the school year has its own, two- page spread where she can write down appointments and organize due dates. This is cool, and since this does cover a school year, it can also be utilized by students.<br /><br />Possibly the best feature of this planner is the fact that it is spiral bound. Too many planners I come across are constructed more like an actual book. And that means you can’t turn to a set of pages and have the planner lie open, with pages in easy view. These planners tend to want to close shut, just a like a book. But this planner is spiral bound and remains open to wherever you turn.<br /><br />I use electronic calendars, but I still like traditional planners. They are great for taking with you wherever you go and it’s nice to write things down using a pen or pencil rather than typing things on a keyboard. It’s a handy, practical planner for teachers and students and it earns an easy recommendation.",

If you don't need anything wider than 8.5, this is a terrific printer. Easy to set up and superior print quality to my ET-2760 (which, to be fair, I have no complaints about, but it was donated to my daughter in law to use for schooling.)

So light weight it easily slips into purse, backpack or briefcase- and flat structure allows for easy stacking.<br /><br />Lines on paper appear light.. a guide for those using journal style (ha! these keep you from writing up hill!) they also help to create metric measuring if needed- In fact, I’ve made a few loose sketches in the book and these don’t interfere with doing so! paper quality exceeds expectations- using pen or pencil Ive has no issue with tear, bleed, smudging- A smooth finish<br /><br />As with any composition style notebook- they are a challenge to open flat and not interfere with what you were doing.. this notebook has tried to combat this issue by using flexible stitching in the seam.. it’s not perfect! But, far easier to work with then some of alternative glued spines.. I think those who prefer to use this type of journal know it’s a trade off; ease and convenience to keep/carry and the known struggles with the binding!<br /><br />These make a great gift or personal purchase.

            "question": "title: Excellent--Yet Needs Improvements by Adding Additional, and Taller, Stoppers, and Moving Legs Inward\ntext: Delivered in one day.  Appears to be exactly as advertised.  So far feels comfortable to use.  I'm enjoying the tremendous amount of \"real estate\" available.  That is a huge advantage over other portable lap desks and  trays.<br /><br />Since I've been using it only a few hours, I'm not star-rating this laptop bed tray desk's comfort or sturdiness.<br /><br />In my opinion this product needs an obvious improvement, namely the additions of additional, and taller stoppers.<br /><br />Why taller?  (Note, multiple stopper could come in various heights.)  To accommodate products such as the AmazonBasics ventilated adjustable laptop computer holder desk stand, the Road Tools Traveler CoolPad®, and Steklo laptop stand adjustable aluminum computer riser, all of which allow for ventilation and reduced heat build up.<br /><br />Why more than one stopper?  Because I doubt that a single stopper of the current size is sufficiently strong to withstand over time the weight of a laptop when the table is tilted.  And, to allow for varying positions of stoppers to accommodate multiple devices, such as a laptop and a smart phone and/or a tablet such as an iPad.<br /><br />Also, for someone using this in bed or sitting normally on a couch, the leg spacing is fine.  But, when one stretches out lengthwise on a couch, the tray's legs are so far apart that the leg nearest the front of the couch actually extends out beyond the couch's front edge.  Each of the tray's legs could be positioned further inward by over an inch (2.54 cm) without any risk that the tray would tip over.  Moving the legs inward would increase the places that the tray could be used.<br /><br />Even without those improvements, my star-rating thus far remains at 5 stars.",

            "question": "title: Nice printer\ntext: I did something I normally wouldn't do before writing this review.  I checked out the reviews for the Epson XP 850, the previous model.  What I found were a ton of angry, frustrated reviews about this printer.<br /><br />The problems were, in no particular order;<br /><br />Ink splattering<br /><br />cartridge failure<br /><br />poor print quality<br /><br />ink cartridges used up over just one or two prints and switching to black and white from color didn't change that problem<br /><br />paper jams<br /><br />Trouble cleaning the heads<br /><br />Poor customer service<br /><br />To sum up, if I was in the market for a printer, scanner, the XP 850 would never make the list of possible buys.<br /><br />I am only going to address the printing capabilities of this Epson.  I haven't used the fax machine or the scanner.  In fact, now that I think about it, I haven't sent a fax in years.  Anyways, clearly Epson had a faulty line on their hands and I'm thinking that this model, the 860, is the correction to all the faults.<br /><br />First off print quality - I used plain old 8 1/2 x 11 to print out a picture from my son's birthday party.  The picture was a bit grainy, like a newspaper color photo.  So I determined to buy real photo quality paper to try the photo again.  The picture quality went up a lot.  I can't say it was professional quality, the lighting was poor, the group was big so the photographer took the photo at a distance.  But having higher quality paper did make a difference.<br /><br />Ink Splattering - I noticed no splatters in all of the 40 pages I printed, not on the color photos and not on the black and white documents I printed.<br /><br />Cleaning - I've not had to do this yet, so I don't know, it looks fairly simple and the areas were easily accessed, so I don't expect any difficulties.<br /><br />Paper jams - none so far.<br /><br />Poor customer service - Also, not something I've experienced.  The printer is working perfectly so there's been no need to call Epson.<br /><br />For me this printer is a fun convenient way to print photos and household documents.  The printing is a bit slow, so if you are someone with a home office and you print a lot, there are better printers out there and definitely less expensive ink cartridges.",

I only use mailers I trust to hold up during the shipping process. When it was time to order 6\" x 10\" mailers, my regular brand wasn't available so I ordered these.  25 -6\" x 10\" mailers come in a pack.  As you can see, they have a cute pineapple design. They're very durable and provide ample protection . The adhesive strip holds beautifully-once the mailer is sealed its not coming open until a knife or scissors is used to cut it open.  Its both waterproof and tear-proof. I have no issues affixing shipping labels, 'fragile' and 'thank you' stickers to the mailers. All stay in place and do not peel off.  There's a feature that I especially like that I don't recall seeing on the other bubble mailer brands I use-the inner lining of the mailer is a gray film which prevents anyone from seeing the contents of the mailer.  I really appreciate that feature!<br /><br />These are awesome bubble mailers. Right before i sat down to write this review, I ordered another pack.  The price is very reasonable and I will continue to purchase/use. Recommended for shipping/storage needs.",

            "question": "title: High quality mobile whiteboard, please read my review if you are new to mobile boards like me...\ntext: I've never owned a mobile white-board before, so some of my assumptions were different than reality. Here are two wrong assumptions I made, which I did not dock any stars for, since one should never assume. LOL!<br /><br />1. The flipping action is simply to get to the other side of the board. It cannot remain horizontal like a table. There is no locking mechanism to keep it in table form. For some reason, I had assumed you could do that. Gather around with your generals to look at the map. LOL! You can't do that.<br /><br />2. When they say adjustable... I assumed some sort of rail system where you slide the board up and down, and lock it in place anywhere from 59 to 70 inches. In reality, you can only choose between 2 height locations... 59 inch or 69 inch. Their stock photos say 70 inch, but their manual says 69 inch. Anyway, whenever you want to change from one height to the other, you need to remove 4 screws with an allen key they provide, or use your own screwdriver with an allen bit. Then reinstall the screws at the new height.<br /><br />Despite my incorrect assumptions, I really like this mobile whiteboard. The bars and poles are made of some sort of metal and feels very sturdy and high quality. The caster wheels are plastic, but for something light like this, it is good enough. The caster wheels can lock too. The board has nice smooth corners molded by ABS plastic, and the fact that it's magnetic was a pleasant surprised. There are some accessories that the manual did not even talk about, but after playing with it for a bit, I realize they are clips/clamps to clip things to the board. I also found these little rubber feet that the manual doesn't discuss. I realized they are for you to cover the screw holes of the height location you do not use. View my pictures to see what I'm talking about. This item is 5-stars!",

The actual metal binder is not particularly heavy duty. It does not have the tab that you push to open. Instead you have to pull apart the rings to get it opened. It also doesn't appear to be attached very securely as it can be manipulated a bit. The zipper pouch is strong and sturdy. The folder system seems comparable to other plastic units that I have used. The outer plastic cover is okay. It's a mid-weight plastic that flexes some. It's clear so you can see the contents. The outer zipper works fine, but I did have to tug on it around the corners to get it to zip. Overall, it's decent.",

Unfortunately my puppy got ahold of one of markers so I am down to 11 of a 12 pack. As long as I only plan to use the front page of a paper this marker is okay.  But if I need to use the back page I'm out of luck. I'm using it now on the back of my Papermate Flair review  &amp; it is bleeding through and obscuring some of the things I've written.<br /><br />I like the Sharpie Ultra Fine Point Permanent Marker, but it is impractical especially in filling out a form, or any other action that requires it not to bleed through to the back of the page. Also something very Annoying is how Difficult it is to take the Cap off each of these markers and even to press the cap down so that it is completely closed. This is important if you have arthritis or nerve damage in your hand.<br /><br />If you are a Sharpie person you'll really like it - just be aware of the cap removal difficulty &amp; bleeding through. I won't be buying them again after I use the pack of 12. But if I ever get to a point where I only need to use the front page of a notebook then I'd certainly consider these markers.",

Maybe it's slightly better for women, because of the two &#34;diamonds&#34; that are glued onto the stylized flower design, near the top.  The flower design itself, done in copper foil, is raised from the card surface.  The copper foil contrasts nicely with the silver background.<br /><br />This is a big, impressive card that you might want to keep on hand for an unexpected birthday.  It comes with a plain white envelope, and is &#34;printed on sustainably sourced paper&#34;.  At 1.3 ounces, this card will take two stamps for mailing; however, the envelope (6-1/8&#34; high by 9-1/4&#34; wide) falls within the size limits for machine-sorted mail (and thus doesn't qualify for an &#34;oversized mail&#34; surcharge).<br /><br />Because this card is heavy enough to require extra postage for mailing, I rate it at 4 stars (&#34;I like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).",

            "question": "title: Motivational Sayings Can Make a Difference\ntext: Children can benefit from receiving reminders when they do well and from receiving encouraging words when they have doubts. In a classroom setting, one easy way to achieve this is with posters and a possible choice for encouragement is this Growth Mindset Posters Bulletin Board Set from Tenare.<br /><br />This set contains small, individual sayings intended to motivate kids. They are made from carboard and can be placed on walls, chalkboards, or any place else where kids can view them and, hopefully, be encouraged by what they read. There are two pieces shaped like halves of a human brain, a rectangular piece, plus individual words and short sayings, separated into two subgroups: Fixed and Growth. The Fixed have to do with fixed mindsets; the growth have to do with ways to change or improve.<br /><br />One issue I have with this set is that some of the statements are negative. I understand that the whole idea is to get kids to realize that these negative thoughts can be changed through growth. But if you’re working with kids who are under performing, they may already be thinking those things and certainly don’t need to hear it or see it permanently displayed on a wall. If they’re not thinking these negative thoughts, then I think it is best not to plant the seed.<br /><br />So, to make the set best, I recommend using only the positive ones. The colors on both definitely brighten up the room and if you stick with the positive statements of encouragement, the desired outcome will be achieved. Yes, these are just sayings but sometimes, this is all you need to get children to do better.<br /><br />Statements of encouragement can motivate children and this Growth Mindset Posters Bulletin Board Set is generally good overall. I don’t like the negative sayings, but the positive ones are nice and they do look good on the classroom walls.",

            "question": "title: Mediocre Laser Printer from Canon.\ntext: The imageCLASS MF8280cw printer is definitely not your average home printer. Unfortunately because the cassette holding only 150 sheets of paper it's not really much of a business printer either.<br /><br />Make sure you have a friend around to help you move and set up this printer. You're also going to need a sturdy place to put it. At almost 60 pounds and measuring 17\" x 19\" it's quite a beast and will take up quite a bit of table/desk top real estate.<br /><br />Print speed, advertized at 14 ppm, is good but not all that fast. Print quality of text is, as are most laser printers, exceptional. Print quality of images on the other hand is poor. I've tried numerous color profiles and settings on board the printer but I haven't been able to achieve color matching that I would even call fair let alone good. Even printing simple pie charts with specific colors (red, green, blue, etc.) set by their decimal numbers the color output was off. Blues are too dark. Yellows are orangeish. Grey areas are blue tinted. I spent an hour or so and used up close to 50 prints trying to get good color output but the best I could get out of the printer was mediocre.<br /><br />Scan speed is amazingly fast but scan quality of images is only good. Text scanning quality is very good. The highest resolution setting for scanning is 600 DPI which isn't that impressive. It's good for documents and not much else. The biggest annoyance with scanning was every time I wanted to scan something I would have to stop what I was doing, wake the printer up from standby mode, switch to the scan mode and then change the device setting to 'remote scanner' even though the printer is connected to my PC via a USB cable. I found this to be annoying.<br /><br />Copying is quite fast and accurate. I scanned several invoices and documents and all were square and true with good quality.<br /><br />I only used the fax feature once but it worked quite well and reasonably quickly.<br /><br />The ADF tray hold 50 sheets and does a good job of feeding paper. You don't have to sit there and nudge items to get the rollers to grab them.<br /><br />Wireless setup seems easy and painless although neither of my tablets will see the printer and my PC lacks a wireless card. The printer pulls an IP address from my wireless router but that's as far as I was able to get with testing the wireless capability.<br /><br />In conclusion... this printer is too large for most home offices and the limited paper capacity makes it cumbersome for all but the smallest of businesses. Currently a replacement set of four toner cartridges for this printer will cost you well over three hundred dollars and with an average of only 1,450 pages per set of cartridges this is rather expensive to run.

Instead of the buttery crayon feeling that some colored pencils can have, these feel more like a regular pencil.  This is a big deal for me because I wanted to use them for writing more so than coloring or drawing.  I have problems with my short term memory so I am constantly making lists and leaving myself notes.  I thought these would be a fun way to make them more colorful and interesting.  It turns the mundane act of making a grocery list into a Lisa Frank journal activity.  The pencils are easy to sharpen and hold a nice, fine point.  The colors change automatically as you write so each word turns out a little different.  It's a really cool effect.",

            "question": "title: Great Beginners Watercolor Paint Set\ntext: Young artists will like the Mead Academie Watercolor Paint Set. A better than basic set with 12 assorted colors and a small brush, this paint set is ready to go out of the box. Just grab a cup of water and some paper, and you’re ready to go.<br /><br />This paint set looks pretty simple and in many ways, it is simple. But I find it better than others of its type for a couple of key reasons. The most important is the brush. Paint sets like this often come with a brush so this is nothing unusual but with other, similar paint sets the brush is often very cheap in quality and doesn’t paint well or last long. The brush here is much better. I also like the assortment of colors because they include shades you don’t see in other sets.<br /><br />The tray, with its assortment of colors, hinged lid, and included brush, reminds me of the paint sets we used as kids. The three sections on the lid can be used to mix colors and the paint is non- toxic and safe. Its small size makes it easily portable and there is enough paint to last many months with normal use. Sure, there are fancier, more deluxe paint sets out there but for the money, this set is going to be difficult to match. It has everything for the young artist in your home with few if any flaws.",

Of course the first thing I noticed when I pulled it from the package was that the upper right hand corner had already been bent.  For some reason the quick reference page has been glued in weirdly imo so that there is no margin to the left & it makes it hard to write ur information there.  I haven’t written mine in there yet bc my entire book seems to have toner or printer ink or something on every single page like someone decided to just sprinkle some fairy dust on every page.  As I intend to use this partly as an art journal I would prefer one without the added splotches all over.  I believe there are 43 sheets of lined paper after the journal section & I am quite happy about that added bonus.  The envelope in the back is quite roomy & will hold a lot of receipts.  It’s a pretty journal & I suspect I will buy more from the manufacturer in the future albeit hopefully without these issues bc this one needs to be replaced & hopefully Amazon will do so.",

It is shown in the product pictures, so it shouldn't be a surprise. It magnetizes to my fridge just fine.<br />I also like the included markers and eraser, which are also magnetized.

However, this includes a column labeled \"notes\" at the end of the week for that. Keeping track of foods to buy, prepare, and what needs to be used up helps a lot in figuring out how best to utilize the budget and to make sure nothing goes bad by forgetting about it.

The board and accessories come nicely arranged in a cellophane package with a ribbon closure so it’s suitable for gifting with minimal additional effort. I forgot to take a photo before I opened it but it looks more like it came from Etsy. I’m actually going to order a few more for coworker gifts.<br /><br />I do wish there were more frame and color options but I went with the traditional looking black/oak framed style. I’d love to order it in a metal frame and larger size, like a true vintage board. The felt is soft and I didn’t have the issues that others mentioned where the lines were crooked. Mine is very straight and the felt is tight and symmetrical.<br /><br />The plastic letters are not a great quality, the only flaw with this, and they were hard to snap out so I ended up trying both an Exacto knife and scissors to cut them loose. That whole process is a bit tedious but I discovered that cutting was a lot faster than snapping, which left behind a little stump that then had to be removed so you’re doing twice as much work. Plus, the snapping is rough on your hands because the stumps left behind have sharp edges. Just cut them with a knife or box cutter so you can do it in one step. I’d pay more for letters that are already loose and, even better, organized alphabetically. Digging through the bag of letters, numbers, and symbols isn’t super convenient and the punctuation pieces are so tiny they just disappear into the bottom.<br /><br />Overall, a nice item with a quality feel. I’m happy to have it and guests get a kick out of it. I look forward to putting pithy statements on this for years to come.",

It has little stickers on it at all the right places to tell you how it works. I got the large version and I am glad I did because it gives me more space to fit my Surface Pro keyboard and monitor and also a portable external monitor in the book holder using the slot at the top and there is till room for and 8 1/2 x 11 page of notes.<br /><br />Some examples of the thoughtful design are that the book holder has a place for it to be stored on the underside of the lap desk. There was a sticker there forcing you to read the instructions about which direction to pull the book holder out from where it clips in to be stored. The book holder fits into the slot at the top and it also has fold out arms, so if you want to use it on any surface without putting it in the slot, you can do that also. The surface of the lap desk is a little bit textured. It is enough that I can lay my phone on it when I have the lap desk at an angle and it does not slide down. It is not always enough though to keep my mouse from sliding down (depends on how much tilt I put on the desk), however, there is a tiny lip just above the slot at the bottom (the one that holds the laptop stopper) that keeps the mouse from sliding off the lap desk. The fold out legs are simple to use and seem very sturdy. The \"slide\" design of the legs work very well to be able to slide the desk  across the mattress (if you're working while sitting in bed) and the legs are spaced well so that the lap desk is pretty steady even though on a soft surface. The little drawer is perfect to store some pens, so they are easily accessible. The little slot at the bottom can also hold two pens end to end and is deep enough that you can rest your wrists over top of that slot while you're typing on a laptop and can't feel the pens. I don't have a light clipped to my lap desk yet, but it is designed so that one would be easy to clip on. The slot at the top works well to hold an iPhone.<br /><br />This is a great addition to my COVID-19 mandated work from home situation and even though I have a good home office set up, I'm not sure I'm going to want to go back to sitting at the desk all day now that I have this option!",

Rewards and direct recognition are best, but it also helps to remind the students to achieve their best. And one good way is by using this set of 11 Motivational Classroom Banner Poster Decorations.<br /><br />These posters are large in size, but not too large. They measure about 40 inches wide and 14 inches tall. Each one contains an inspirational, motivational message on one side and the name of a month of the year on the other. With the months, you just need to flip the appropriate poster around when its time comes around, display it for the duration, then flip it back the other way to display the message when it’s time to move on to the next month. There are 11 months- the only one without a display is July, and that is because the typical school isn’t in session in July.<br /><br />The month side of each of these posters is colorful while the message side is like that of a blackboard. The posters look nice on the walls or boards of a classroom. It’s best to display the messages at an angle, as they seem to get attention better that way and students are more apt to look at them. My wife says that the kiddos do look at these posters and make comments on them, so they do have an effect.<br /><br />Young people need motivation and sometimes, a simple message is all it takes. This set of 11 posters from Global Printed Products is high in quality and achieves its intended goal, which is to encourage kids to be the best they can be. It’s an excellent set of posters that belongs in every elementary school classroom.",

Since this scanner will scan to either 14 or 22 megapixel resolution my card holds either a little over 6500 images at the lower resolution or about 4100 at the higher one.<br /><br />One of the reasons I love this scanner is you can do some basic editing while scanning. By basic I mean color correction and brightness levels, as well as some orientation operations like flipping and mirroring.<br /><br />Another reason this is handy is you can scan not only 35mm slides, but color and black and white negatives that were common from times past. Indeed, I have a cache of family photo negatives going back to the late 1940s/early 1950s that this device successfully (and quickly) scanned.<br /><br />Now for the value proposition: I checked some local and internet based scanning services. The price leader was twenty-two cents per slide. Doing the math this means that if you have over five hundred slides this scanner will pay for itself. Actually, if you have 550 or more slides this AND the SD card I mentioned above will be paid for based in their prices at the time of this review.<br /><br />One final note: you can process about six slides per eighteen minutes assuming that you do a little color and brightness tweaking on each. This is a more manual device with no automatic controls, but for home jobs it is more than fast and not terribly labor intensive. For me the value proposition is solid!",

            "question": "title: A Very Happy Addition to Our Home, Great Flexibility, Great Value\ntext: This is my first experience with an all-in-one office printer, and so far I couldn't be happier.  We love the ability to copy at home and the duplexing is great.<br /><br />  Usage - My wife was not too happy about the idea of adding this device to our family. She still glares at my old, unused, dried, ink-clogged printer in our small office space.  However this printer quickly proved it's worth when our son forgot his extra vocabulary sheets at school. Within seconds we had enough replacement copies for the week. Two days later we printed an iron-on transfer so my son could go trick or treating as a member of Camp Half Blood from the Percy Jackson Series. Then in the following weeks we have used it far more than we ever would have guessed.<br /><br />Size and Construction - The Box this printer comes in is heart-stoppingly huge.  Out of the box, it's still a pretty big device (perhaps the purpose of the packaging is to make it seem smaller.)  The glossy black plastic does not have the most classy, rich feel to it. It shows dust, fingerprints and cat hairs far more than a matte finish would have. Also the plastic feels a little cheap. But overall the construction seems decent, especially the design and construction of the touch screen.  The controls are simple and intuitive.<br /><br />Setup - Setup was amazingly simple.  We are a Mac household and I'll vouch for the ease of the wireless setup. I simply needed to let the printer find our wireless network then input the WEP Key when prompted.  We installed the client onto our Macs and we were off and printing.  The HP software does seem a little bloated at around 150 Megs (we did not install the scanning software.) But we were printing and copying less than 10 minutes out of he box with no frustrations.<br /><br />Print Quality - We are very happy with the print quality.  Our needs are not great, and they are greatly surpassed by what this printer is capable of.  We copied a number of color pictures from Toy Story books for our youngest and they came out beautifully. Also copying black and white text docs look great.<br /><br />Wireless - The wireless seems to be the difference between use and disuse.  We leave the printer powered off to save electricity, but it is so convenient to print to the queue, then just power the printer on.  Much easier than our old finding the cable for our old printer.<br /><br />E-Print - OK we aren't able to use it yet, but we are impatiently looking forward to iOS4.2 which promises to release our iPad and iPhones to print directly to the printer, without being tethered to a computer.  I can't wait, at least the printer is ready now...<br /><br />Noise - I was a little worried when first setting the printer up.  The initial setup was pretty noisy but seems good now. Warm up noise is reasonable and scanning and printing are fairly quiet.<br /><br />Cost - The cost of the cartridges seems a little high at $40 for an XL set of inks, but I guess when I look at per print price, the cost is very reasonable due to capacity.  We'll see how this works out in the long run, but so far the math seems reasonable.  I sure don't see a lot of generic replacement cartridges for this printer though.<br /><br />All in all, greatly exceeds our expectations.  We are very happy to have it in our house.",

He has tendonitis in his wrists from so much typing, so I got him Aelfox's keyboard memory foam wrist rest to help alleviate his pain. He's now used it 2 days in a row (both were 10 hour work days) and he  is stunned at the relief he is already experiencing thanks to the wrist rest! He commented to me that he's so used to feeling pain while he works, he just cannot believe its possible to work feeling NO pain now. I sat at his desk and tried it out as well. The memory foam inside is nice and durable and at the same time, extremely comfortable. The wrist rest doesn't slip and slide on the desk either, it stays put where its placed.  It measures the same length as his keyboard and is the perfect size.  Neither of us are gamers so we passed the mouse pad along to his brother in law and nephew who are gamers.  Both say the mouse pad feels great with the gel interior and they're slowly getting used to using it. If you've never experienced tendonitis before, trust me, you don't want to. I had it years ago from repetitive motion (from typing)and wound up needing surgery on my wrist for it. It can be EXTREMELY painful.  Protect your hand and wrists NOW so you don't wind up suffering down the road. The Aelfox keyboard wrist rest will protect your hands and wrists while typing and the mouse pad will protect hands and wrists while gaming.  Both are 'must-have' items for those who type/participate in gaming on a regular basis.",

Granted it isn't a decorative calendar but it's a basic &#34;no frills&#34; one that can easily hang on a wall without a nail - mine is hanging in the kitchen with just a pushpin and can be taken down to write on. I happen to be very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone looking for this type of calendar. I also think the price is quite reasonable. The picture is accurate but I have taken one as well for a reference.",

I've lived with my canon printer for 2 years now and it is truly terrible. The worst part is honestly the ink. I NEVER get more than 60 pages per ink cartridge. That is a really low yield when the black cartridges cost $17-20 each. That means for a $17 cartridge, i'm paying almost 30 cents per page printed. So this &#34;inexpensive&#34; printer WILL COST YOU when it comes to ink.<br /><br />Let me also add that i've never printed photos until last week. What a racket. It won't let you print on 8.5x11 photo paper. You can ONLY print onto 5x7 or 4x6 photo paper. Well, okay. That's annoying but i'll play your game printer. So when I used a NICE piece of glossy photo paper and I made sure all the settings were correct, I printed a photo and it looked awful. I expected it to at least look decent. But no. It looked like garbage.<br /><br />I am seriously a cheap person and I will never buy a canon printer ever again. I've learned my lesson. Sometimes cheap is just CHEAP. I'm going back to HP. I got a free printer from HP with my laptop back in college and it lasted me 10 years before it finally died. I can probably recall every time I bought ink for that thing. It was a crazy work horse. This canon printer? I know i've bought ink at least a dozen times. Do yourself a favor and get something better. You will kick yourself for having wasted your time and money on this printer.",

The printer comes supplied with  two sets of ink bottles - enough for two years, or in my case, perhaps more.  I'm a writer, so make multiple copies of what I write.  The printing is crisp and clear, there are no streaks or, strange lines - just perfect copies.  It holds a good volume of paper and prints quickly.  I am 100% pleased with this printer, and salute Epson for coming out with the &#34;Eco-Tank&#34; - what an improvement!

I'm using this to sort and store my paint brushes. I have a lot of paint brushes because I use different types of brushes for different mediums and don't like to mix them. This does a great job for me since there are 4 slots, I can organize each different type of brush in each different slot. The clear acrylic helps me see inside so I don't need to grab more than one to find which one I need. I'd recommend this because it holds so much, but only takes a very small amount of shelf space.

Let's take a look at these..<br /><br />WHAT ARE THESE LIKE?<br />These book ends are heavy metal.  They are a really pretty bright navy if that makes sense with a little bit of cyan mixed in (your printer ink blue is cyan if you have inkjet color).  These come very well wrapped in a bubble mailer so they are not chipped or scratched.  They have the deer cut out from the metal and there are four little pads on the bottom to keep them from scratching or moving when holding up books.<br /><br />HOW DO THESE WORK?<br />When I got these, I ran right to my bookcase and put them in.  I am thrilled to say that they held a bunch of rather large oversized HARDCOVER books in place without sliding or bending at all.  They have held well and don't see to move.<br /><br />ANY PROBLEMS?<br />So far there are no problems.  These are sturdy, look really nice, and are just like you see in the photo with this listing.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For a well wrapped, nice colored heavy duty pair of book ends, this set did the trick for me.  They don't take up too much room, yet they hold up heavy books, even the oversized ones.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS for these.  Not only do they work well, the look really nice too.  I like them.  Kudos to the company for wrapping them so well so they arrived to me in good condition too.",

            "question": "title: Great map for giving adults and kids a good overview of geography!\ntext: I am a homeschooling mom who is spending the next 2 years \"galloping the globe\" with my son as we immerse ourselves in world geography, cultures and history. I wanted a nice map that we could hang in a prominent place in our school room (which also happens to be our hearthroom just off our kitchen). I knew I would need a laminated surface for dry erase markers and the sticky dots we would be using on the map. I also needed something large enough to use as a reference without having to be right on top of it. This map fit the bill quite well.<br /><br />It arrived in great condition, well packaged and quickly shipped. It is worth nothing that my map did not come with a hanging strip as originially advertised. I contacted the seller and they were very prompt in making it up to me. The lack of a hanging strip turned out to not be an issue in the long run since we ended up mounting the map semi-permanently to the wall by framing it with molding and holding it flat to the wall.<br /><br />We have been using it since August and it has been a dream. The dry erase marker comes off nicely when needed and borders etc are easily definable on the countries. I like the little flags at the bottom as well.  The only thing we have to be conscious of is the distortion- esp. at the arctic areas- which makes some countries (i.e. Greenland) appear positively enormous. This is a function of the type of map it is, and we just pull our globe down for comparison when we are studying a new country in order to give it a more realistic estimate of how that country really fits into the size of things.  Once your child can understand how things have to be stretched to show them flat it is just a matter of remembering that.<br /><br />I'd certainly order again!",

Attached is a picture of one item I labeled so that the size can be seen.<br /><br />I do feel these are great for canning because the labels can be easily removed. However, they are almost too easy to remove. I was able to lift the corner of the label and remove it immediately. When I ran the label under water, the adhesive disintegrated as it should.<br /><br />One other dislike I have besides the small size and thin texture, is that I found it almost impossible to see the label outline and as a result it was difficult for me to remove it from the paper backing it came on. I guess I can chalk that up to older eyes but the delineation between the label and the sheet it comes on needs to be clearer.<br /><br />Nevertheless, these do work as designed and are easily removed from plastic, glass, and canning lids. The fact that a laser or inkjet printer can be used with the appropriate Avery template from their website is a plus.  At the current price of $14.14 for 50 tiny labels ($.28 cents each), I think this is very expensive for what they are. However, when I looked on the Avery site, the list price for the same labels is $6.25 so I would order them there.",

It has a plain aluminum border and a tray.  It cost less than fancier boards in this size which can fetch up to five hundred dollars (twice the price I paid).  It arrived by freight in a battered box, but managed to avoid any damage.  It's comprised of a masonite backer board, a thin steel sheet with the porcelain finish and the aluminum border that holds the edges together.  I haven't had it long enough to know whether the porcelain finish is as durable as I'll need it to be.  The only complain I have is the flatness of the board is poor.  I hung it by the pre-installed slotted holes in the back.  I used two sturdy 50 pound wall anchors.  The problem is the board does not lie flat against the wall, nor does it stay flat.  I blame the masonite backer board.  It is inadaquate, and the mount hangars are inadaquate.  I could probably fix it by using large tube of Liquid Nails in a caulking gun and just glue the board to the wall solid the way some mirrors are mounted, but it would be permanent.  The board would be destroyed to remove it.  I will probably just try to hold it down with some double-sided tape or additional hardware.<br /><br />I don't know if the more expensive ones are better or not, but this one is utility quality.  If I were doing an install in a well-furnished room, a company conference room, a well-appointed classroom, a boardroom or anything like that I would look elsewhere.",

I had an older model before through my job and missed it so much that I bought a brand new model. This is really very portable. It fits well in my laptop bag. I also use it at home with my desktop. It scans in both sides of documents quickly and easily. The only issues it can have is with extra long receipts, but I get around that by cutting the receipts in half before scanning. This is one office tool I rely on heavily. The software that comes with it is nice for organizing, but I have my own system. This scans well right to PDF. It's also a reasonably price. I have a heavy-duty laser printer/scanner/fax, but I prefer using this for all of my scanning. I'm very attached to this piece of office equipment. I would definitely purchase another if needed, but this one, after a year, is still working like a champ!",

It's lightweight, and has wheels, so it's easy to roll around to different areas that I use for workspace. The wheels are very smooth to move. It's metal and very sturdy. There is ample storage, so instead of many visits to storage shelves and closets, I keep all my supplies close to hand. This helps the rhythm of my project go smoothly. The small basket is ideal for my paint brushes and there is plenty of space on each shelf for a variety of items I use regularly. It works well for storage between uses and also during work on a project. The hooks are good for scissors and rulers. I can easily imagine this would work well for a variety of projects such as beauty products in the bathroom, gardening supplies, kitchen supplies and school supplies.

My feelings on that are the same. However, after using it with my MacBook, I'm upping my review to five stars, simply because it does excel in some key areas for me. I don't have the settings issue with the Mac and this printer, which is funny since I have them going from HP to HP, but not from Mac to HP. Go figure. There is really no set up on the Mac. Your wifi finds the printer and you use it. Easy. This printer also is great with cardstock. My Brother laser printer slightly rolls my cardstock. It is an annoying issue I have just always dealt with. This printer, no rolling or curving my card stock. It is flat when it comes out of the printer! It also doesn't skip or have feed issues with cardstock like my previous Lexmark printer was prone to. So, it does a better job than some other very expensive printers that I own. The image quality stays crisp, even when doing all black and even when doing draft quality. That is pretty impressive. So, despite the small draw backs of settings issues with my HP, this is a REALLY good printer.<br />I like this printer. The only reason I wouldn't give it a full five stars is because of  one issue I have with the settings. It connects easy enough. The printer walks you through setting it up. It doesn't hold much paper. Around 20 sheets seems to be about all it can hold. It has no tray, so be aware of that when it is spitting out copies. Ink was simple to install. It does work while it is charging.  My other issue is the settings. It ignores whatever I put in on my computer end. Like, I say on Microsoft Word to print 5 copies, it ignores that. You have to open the printer settings every time the printer box pops up when you choose this printer and change the settings you need changed there. Also, the power saver mode turns the printer off. It doesn't reawaken when you click &#34;print&#34;. You have to go to the printer and manually push the power button, wait about 30 seconds, then click &#34;print&#34; on the computer. You don't have to use the power saver mode. It does give you options on that.<br />If you need to print a lot of stuff very often, this is not the printer for you. If you need to print one or two things every now and then, this is the printer for you. It would work well for students. It does fold down to a pretty compact size.",

Especially the purple color.  Actually all the colors are bright and vibrant I guess the purple is my favorite to use.  Why do I need all these pens and colors?  Mainly for journaling.  I like to mix up the colors for different months.  I also have a 5 year journal and each year will be 1 specific color.  It’s cheaper to just buy the boxes instead of buying refills.  These are great pens.  They write smoothly and do not skip.  The ink dries pretty fast except if you’re writing over white-out.  For some reason it takes longer for the ink to dry so give it a little more time or you’ll have a smudgey mess.  Each pen has a little wax ball around the point to keep the ink fresh until you are ready to use them.  I do go through a lot of these because of how much I write so your mileage may vary.  This brand is my favorite of all gel pens.  I just wish the other colors would come in the boxes such as orange and green.",

            "question": "title: Strong, flexible, reliable for a rubber band ball\ntext: Recently I pulled out some old storage tubs and found an old rubber band ball I had made as a child, about  6\" in diameter. Many of the rubber bands had  held up, but some had melted/broken over the many years of it being in an attic, so despite being a grown adult I wanted to protect my creation from further deterioration. For this purpose I purchased these rubber bands as a basic layer, and some ceramic mold rubber bands as an outer layer.  While admittedly this goes against my long-maintained policy of never using wide rubber bands for the ball, needs must when the devil drives. Besides, when stretched, they hardly counted as wide rubber bands at all<br /><br />These are perfect for the job. They easily stretch to cover the 6\" ball, though near the end I was approaching the limit. Zero broke on me - which was a common experience I had when making the ball all those years ago - and all felt very secure and quite elastic. There was some small variation in size, but all the rubber bands fit over the ball. the wider form factor made stretching them over the ball much more comfortable than they might have been, as it gave each band more surface area to grip onto during the process.<br /><br />Only reason for dropping a star is the price, could be less expensive for the quantity you get - which wasn't bad, but wasn't great either.<br /><br />Would recommend for rubber band balls.",

            "question": "title: Perfect markers for \"premium\" coloring books ...\ntext: I've finally found the pens to use for my nicer coloring books -- the ones with brilliant artwork but that contain images printed on both sides of the page.  Alcohol markers bleed through (Copic, Spectrum Noir, BIC Mark-its, Sharpies, etc.), so unless you're willing to sacrifice the image on the opposite side, alcohol markers are more or less off the table.<br /><br />These are water-based markers and are much less likely to bleed through or feather (seep outside the lines).  You still need to be a little careful -- for example, you don't want to hold the tip of the pen to the paper for a long time as it WILL bleed through.  Just color &#34;normally,&#34; and you should be fine.<br /><br />The 36 color set is perfect.  You have enough variation within each color family to get some really nice shading effects.  The triangular shape is really comfortable, too.  I have severe osteoarthritis in my hands, so I have to be careful (I use &#34;cushions&#34; with my colored pencils).  But these are really comfortable.<br /><br />So glad I found these -- solid 5 stars from me.  Highly recommended to my coloring enthusiast friends!",

We've run several dozen name tags, award certificates, 8\"x10\" images and other miscellaneous items through it without encountering any problems. The lamination speed is acceptable. The outside of the unit remains acceptably cool during operation. The cord could be somewhat longer. No matter where I used it I needed a short extension cord to reach the wall outlet.<br /><br />My only two real complaints about the unit would be:<br /><br />1) Slow heat time. It takes quite a few minutes to get to operating temperature. It would be best to line up a large batch job to run through the laminator than to turn it on and wait repeatedly during the day to do things piecemeal.<br /><br />2) The smoke colored plastic door/hatch that covers the input feed slot I found not only VERY hard to get open but had to literally pound on to get closed. As this is cheap, brittle plastic I can see it breaking rather easily.<br /><br />All in all the device preformed quite well.",

If you look at the reviews  you'll see what I mean.  Who wants to spend nearly $200. for replacement ink cartridges that are NOT HP and that their printer will reject?  Be careful!  On the other hand, HP needs to get on the ball and start making their 910 color cartridges available to us.  I have been trying to get the HP 910 Cyan blue cartridge for at least a month with no results!  Amazon was good enough to have the Magenta, the Yellow, and the Black 910 cartridges, but no Cyan blue.  What on Earth is going on with HP?

I was a little concerned that this was more novelty than function but I tried using the clips and they hold well. This comes with 20 cows...er, clips...and while it is difficult to find more of this exact shape to refill when these are gone, regular clips will work.<br /><br />The top fits on snugly but is not hard to pop on or off. You can pick up the whole thing and flip it upside down, and the top will remain in place. The magnet is strong enough to pick up 3-4 clips and not drop them when popped off.<br /><br />Of course, there’s the novelty aspect. This is a great conversation starter as well as an office gizmo that is sure to get a few chuckles from others. However, in some environments it might wander off when you’re not looking… And if you have access to a UV light, it gets even more interesting.<br /><br />This silly thing makes me smile.

It takes up a good portion of my large desk!<br /><br />I was quite skeptical at first, but I have quickly taken to it. The amazing thing, is that it has become one with my desk. The pad does not slide at all. I can push on it and it doesn't move. It is like it is glued down (it isn't, it just grips that well). My mouse reacts well with it- operates as normal. Considering how much space it takes up, I wondered if it would interfere with being able to write on a piece of paper. So I took my mechanical pencil and a slip of paper and wrote my name. The pad is has texture (hard to tell in my pic, but the product pic is accurate), but it is smooth enough to not pick up any texture, and firm enough that I could easily write with a pencil without the graphite breaking. I usually write on a pad, so it would not have really been an issue if it didn't work, but at least I can provide that information in this review.<br /><br />I had planned on using this on an end table (actually situated between two pieces of furniture) if I didn't like it as a desk mouse pad. I have a table about this size and it could use a cover on it. Since we always use it for drinks, etc, I thought it would be great there.

Slime 1050 Rubber Cement - 8 oz. The thing I like about this rubber cement is it's not as tacky as some of the ones in the market.

After I'm finished with laying down all the different colors markers and medias on my art, I can use a rubber cement eraser to make the paper like it was at the start. I also like to do a little water coloring on the paper in light shades and then put a little rubber cement on it so then when I put darker shades and remove the rubber cement the lighter color comes through as an accent.

There are 2 feet and that just slip into the slots. Once the feet are in place, the shield is sturdy and doesn't wobble. The acrylic has protective paper on it to keep it from getting scratched during transport. The paper was not difficult to remove and just peeled off, though it did rip sometimes and I had to find new places to grab onto to pull. There is a pass through at the bottom which is bigger than I expected. If you work with little children (size not age), it may not be as effective at protecting because of the size of the opening. It just depends on how much higher than the table they are. Just something to consider. You could easily pass a text book or binder through the opening.

After I clumsily broke it, however, I needed to buy a new PDA.  The Palm V had been discontinued, and I thought that the Vx was ridiculously expensive, so I bought the Visor Platinum.<br />VERDICT:  It is considerably larger and clunkier-looking than the beautiful Palm V, but its faster speed and USB connection are great!  On top of the neat new (to me, anyway) applications like the world clock and enhanced datebook, I added AvantGo and Vindigo (NY, SF and LA).  The Platinum's memory isn't even close to being full.  I'm hoping that the nice platinum finish won't wear off over time, but that remains to be seen.<br />The things about the Platinum that I don't like are its thickness, its lack of a rechargable battery like the Palm V has, and its clunky snap cover.  For a PDA this size, they should have had the swivel cover like some Palm devices have.<br />Overall I'm very happy with my purchase... it does its job very well and is a hell of a lot cheaper than the Palm Vx.",

If you’re looking for a fine- tipped ink pen in a convenient package with plenty of pens to go around, then you might like this set of Japanese Technical Gel Ink Pens.<br /><br />Utilizing black, gel ink, this pack of 12 pens have a tiny, .35 millimeter tip, which means they produce very fine lines. The gel ink dries quickly and because so little ink is dispersed, it doesn’t smear. I would also assume that each pen lasts a while, but I haven’t had these long enough to know for certain.<br /><br />The tube of these pens is clear and I like that fact because it means I can see the ink on the inside of the pen, thus I can monitor how much is left. The thin lines are good for multiple uses and while I use them for ordinary writing, they are also useful for artwork and other situations where thin, narrow lines are desired.<br /><br />We still need ways to write the old-fashioned way and we likely always will need them. Japanese Technical Gel Ink Pens are a very good means to write thin, black lines and while I prefer a little thicker pen body for more comfortable gripping, these are still good pens overall.",

This was not a huge deal as I plan to use these more as background lights for product photos. There were no instructions with my set but for their intended purpose it's not to hard to figure out how they are supposed to work. The light standoffs are a nice heavy build and the lights are pretty bright. The cable lengths from the light standoffs to the power splitter are only about 2 feet. The power splitter has 6 ports so it is possible to plug 2 more sets into it. From this splitter to the controller you get another 2 feet of cable and from the controller to the wall plug you get another 3'. If you were to use this kit as intended on a wall, these lengths may not work unless you modify and ad more cable. However for my indented use, the cable lengths are just fine.<br />It would have been nice if these LED lights were RGB however I think you could take a strip of colored plastic film wrapped around the light between the top and standoff base to create a colored lighting effect. This will actually be more effective with the white light. Overall the build quality of these lights is really nice and I think they are of great value for their intended purpose.",

I've had neck surgery so having a desk at the correct height is essential. Even at it's lowest adjustment height the desk was still too high. I did order another to try, sadly it was also perfect except for it was ALSO too high!<br /><br />If there was more maneuverability to raise and lower this desk, it would meet all the qualities of a great laptop bed tray desk!<br /><br />I also noticed the measurements on the description were off by at least a couple of inches. Perhaps I wasn't measuring in the same manner? Anyway, I had to return them but I am still waiting for a LOWER adjustable height setting so I can have the perfect desk laptop tray for my comfort!<br /><br />No ordinary lapdesk will do, this is the one for me, I need a lower height adjustment so my arms are comfortable and not reaching out and up to type! Keeping the table level is also essential for supporting me while I type.<br /><br />For instance, say the lowest height from the bed to the table (keeping the table level and not tilted) is 9 inches, if it were able to go lower, down to 6 inches at the lowest height, that's what I'm watching for!<br /><br />If you work sitting non the floor, couch, or bed THIS table desk tray is sturdy, easy to open and close, it's quality materials are as described.

However, when printing Christmas cards, my Canon died, and I had been impressed with this HP model when I was helping my sister sort out hers, so I bought one (MFP M479fdw).  Software seems to work reliably so far, so I think HP has addressed that somewhat, granted it is a bit rough and crude in places, but it works.  And it works from both Windows 10 and macOS 11 (Big Sur), as well as from mobile (iOS).  The printer hardware seems to be very good, output arrives quite fast.  One of the problems you run into with cheaper printers (including some lower end HPs) is that they do not put much horsepower into the printer CPUs, and cost-reduce the hardware to the point that they are slow and do not hold up, but this version seems well designed and made.  Ratings from PC Magazine, Wirecutter, etc. generally have this printer at or towards the top, I would say that is accurate.  Print quality on text is excellent, graphics from web pages and similar also excellent, scans are very good (a custom flat-bed would be a tad better, but this is for an all-in-one amongst the best I have seen).  For printing high-quality pictures, you probably still want a Canon or Epson InkJet printer, but this one prints OK for a laser.  HP does not ship this printer with full duty cycle cartridges, but the ones they ship with will still do a decent number of pages.  Control screen is touch and good sized, gets the job done.  Unit is fairly heavy and large, so if you are using this on a desk, check the dimensions some.  The printer is not cheap, but it has excellent print quality and appears to be very well built, so HP has come back to where it once was, at the top.",

The paper is thick, so with care, destruction can be avoided, and if you are not a perfectionist, you might not mind anyway.

I also like the symmetrical square shape of this computer which is aesthetically pleasing. The quick start guide sends you to the Canon page where set up instructions are shown in a brief video. Installing the ink cartridges is very easy, they snap into place without any problems. When you are done installing ink cartridges and paper, you download the driver. The whole process takes about 15 minutes depending on the speed of your computer and network. The computer produces fine quality copies and text documents. Great printer at a good price.",

And then a month-at-a-glance spread over 2 pages for quick scanning. This planner does a great job with that. The months are all tabbed for easy access and there's a spot for contacts and important dates right up front. The spiral binding looks like it will be sturdy and hold up and the plastic front and back are very thick. I took 1 star off because I felt the paper could be just a smidge thicker. I put a few pix in review. You can see the lines from other side in one of them.<br />**This planner is for 12 months only- starting in July 2019 and going thru June of 2020**",

I bought fine tipped markers off Amazon to color code my planner and they don't bleed through the pages which is perfect.<br />(4) I like that it's not just your typical calendar (Jan-Dec).

The little cabinet it comes with is convenient to out things in like pencils, the book stand you can put on the bottom slot, a phone, and more. I also like that it comes with a tablet and book holder. However, one thing I'll mention about it that I'm not sure is intentional or not is that the book/tablet holder, that conveniently has a space in the bottom to hold it I might add, doesn't go into the top slot that it's supposed to easily. It takes a lot of effort to make it go in there. I certainly have to try to not actually break it, which isn't too hard, but is a slight concern. I dunno if that's the way it's supposed to be, or if that's a slight defect. If it is, it is a very minor one though, as it still goes in there, albeit with a little effort, and once it's tucked in there it's pretty sturdy and won't move. And speaking of sturdy, that's also what I'd call the desk itself as well. It's made out of good materials and is built well. It has different angles and can be height adjusted. Which is great. Better than any other lap desk I've had before. The only thing I'd wish it had is adjustable angles for the book/tablet holder, if at all possible. But that aside, I think it was worth it.

One problem with this is the lack of exercise I get during the day, but more of a concern to me is the poor circulation because of being seated for long periods of time. I looked to this standing desk to help me with that, and it works well. That said, I have found another use for it that makes it even more useful.<br /><br />I have the medium-sized standing desk, and it is large enough to handle my laptop as well as my keyboard and mouse. This is all the space I need. With the standing desk raised, there is some room under it for things like speakers, art supplies and a few other things. Obviously, they have to move when the desk is collapsed.<br /><br />This is a solid desk and it’s made very well. A latch mechanism on the side is used to lift the desk, and a piston as part of the lift mechanism assists in lifting. The piston also resists when collapsing the desk and I found it took some effort to push the desk back down. This is good from a stability point and is a necessary part of the design, but it should be kept in mind - it’s not effortless to open or close, it does require some exertion in both directions.<br /><br />I found that this desk is a perfect size for a dinner tray, and when set on the floor it works very, very well as a tray table in front of the TV. It’s not an ideal solution, of course, but it does work.<br /><br />This is a nice standing desk and I am very pleased with it. It’s a good size and it’s made well, and it can server as a tray table in a pinch.",

They are actually pretty simple to use after you read the directions - which include little drawings showing each step by the way.<br /><br /> I used them to seal some old photos that we don't have digital copies of and had no problems at all. Just take your time, center the photo, and smooth the top layer slowly and carefully to get a complete & bubble free seal. Pro tip - write any identifying information and dates on the back of the picture first and it'll be preserved for future generations as well.

This small utility blade was well-packaged and arrived in great condition. I use different knife blades all over the place for different uses and reasons. I've never had a blade that I felt would be okay to carry in my purse before, although I often wish I had one handy when I am out and about. What's different about this knife is that the blade is on a spring, so that you have to apply pressure with your thumb continuously to use it. Once  you release pressure, the blade retracts back into the housing. The blade only protrudes 1cm from the housing. There is a thoughtful key-ring hole on the blade as well, so you can place it on your key-ring or retractable ID badge holder. I'm carrying this in my purse as it's handy to have a tool to open packaging right away instead of waiting until I get home. Now, I can open and toss packaging into the trash straight away before I bring new items into my home to use a blade stored safely inside.  I just put it straight into the recycle bin or trash, and that means less trash I need to gather and toss outside into the bin. I recommend this for adult use only.

I am writing the review for the desktop easel product.<br /><br />I have had a whiteboard since college, when I bought it to assist me with doing classwork. It’s a large and unwieldy thing and it is certainly not portable. My wife and I have a smaller one on the fridge, but a small, portable whiteboard would come in handy all over the house. I was very interested in this 9”x11” clipboard-size board as it is about the size I have had in mind for a while. It’s an excellent board and I am very pleased with it.<br /><br />This is a glass board which is a positive and a negative at the same time. On the plus side, it does not scratch or stain like coated fiberboard which is a problem with “normal” whiteboards. On the flip side, glass is susceptible to cracking when dropped and it is heavier than fiberboard.<br /><br />The glass surface is smooth and ideal for working with dry erase markers. It is basically just straight glass that is painted white on the back side. Writing goes on easy and wipes right off. I have not had this long, but so far there has been no staining and cleaning off residue is very easy.<br /><br />Though I use this as a clipboard, it is set up with a fold-out back to make it stand on a flat surface. This is handy when I want to set the board up on the kitchen table or other central location in the house. What this board does not have is a hole in the back to make handing the board up on a hook or nail which would have been useful but it’s not necessary. When the board is laid flat, the easel forms a small drawer underneath which is large enough to hold a couple of markers.<br /><br />I am very pleased with this whiteboard. It’s the size I need, it’s easy to write on and easy to clean off again. It works as a clipboard too.",

Since I am really a fan of the Bold 1.6ers, I decided to try the Medium Point 1.0 Velocity pens. I enjoy it better than thinner pens. I think arthritic or people with nerve damage would find these pens easier to grip. In comparison to the ZEBRA F301 Stainless Steel 0.7mm Fine point these VELOCITY pens are lighter weight.<br /><br />This is my first experience with this pen and while I like the BOLD more, I really am enjoying writing with this Smooth gliding pen. I write a great deal at work & for pleasure away from work. This 12 Pack will be a nice addition to my Pen Collection. I will be using them everyday. With twelve I can have a few at home, a few at work, and a few in my bag, as well as one or two in the car.<br /><br />I find myself being able to both write in cursive and easily print with these pens. The retractable point means less accidental ink stains on my clothes, in my bag, on the bed, or the couch's upholstery, or on my hands. I recommend without reservation to people who like writing with a thicker, lighter weight pen. It's a very smooth writing pen exactly what I need daily. I hope you enjoy using these black pens as much as I do.<br /><br />Too bad it's bedtime I could easily write a few more hours with this pen. Not enjoying tonight's humidity though. I'm putting a few pens in my bag for work right now, as well as taking a couple upstairs. Have a good night - looking forward to using one of these at work tomorrow.",

However, this means I will have to also be sure to somehow let myself know what color the ink is in the altered pens. I can slide the color-coded silicone sleeve off of the faulty pen and install it on the other, but that will not look so cool, since the top of the pens are also color-coded and so won't end up matching unless I am \"lucky\" enough to get a working casing that matches the color of the insert.

It feels lightweight and cheap, but it gets the job done. I do think the ones with wireless usb receivers, or Bluetooth connection are much more convenient.<br /><br />* I'm fairly new to barcode scanners. I assumed like other gadgets, you download some sort of software or app to view the codes you've scanned. That is not the case at all. I found out that they work like keyboard inputs. You can open any program on your pc where you can see the blinking cursor, such as word, notepad, excel, etc. Wherever you put the blinking cursor, aka, insertion point, that is where the codes will show up. You can set it up to show up instantaneously the moment you scan, or you can use the scanner in storage mode, then upload everything later.<br /><br />* Because there are no apps or software to download like with traditional gadgets, all the settings and set-ups are done by scanning barcodes. Netum gives you a little thick manual. Unfortunately, it's thick because it's accommodating many different languages. There are only a few pages for English, and very little barcodes. Each barcode is for a particular setting. The one setting that is very important to me is the ability to remove a certain amount of characters at the start or at the end of the code. For example, when you scan a USPS package, it'll add 9 digits/characters in front of the tracking number that's on your package. These digits are hidden, that's why you don't see them on your package. I then have to manually delete them, which is a hassle. There should be a barcode setting to remove a certain amount of characters at the start or end of a tracking number. This setting is not in the manual, but they do provide an email for you to contact them should you need settings that are not in the manual. I find that very inconvenient. Why not create a complete manual and set it online for us to download?<br /><br />Overall, for the price you're paying, this is not bad. I'll go 4-Stars!",

            "question": "title: Super convenient, works perfectly, have never had to call tech support. [Updated after one year: slight problems, still love it]\ntext: I wanted this scanner but I was very, very scared by the bad reviews.  I have used it many, many times over the course of the last seven months.  It has been flawless.  [Updated below - it is no longer flawless, but still very happy with it]  It is super convenient.  You don't have to connect it to a computer.  If you have documents to scan and you don't want to start up a computer or sort them, you just wake it up (this takes less than one second) and scan your documents, and deal with them later, at the office or whatever.<br /><br />The scanner has a small touch screen.  It sucks for entering your password for Google Drive or DropBox, but fortunately you only have to do that once.  I entered my NeatCloud credentials once and never again.  I entered my Google Drive credentials once when I set it up and then a second time after the over-the-air software update.  It has never logged me out just because time elapsed or anything like that.<br /><br />Other than the tiny keyboard which is never used, the touch screen has a nice interface.  When you scan something in, the pages pop up.  They auto-rotate, even within the same document, so if you scan something with 5 pages landscape and 5 pages portrait, they'll all be correct in the PDF.  On the rare occasions that it gets one wrong, you can rotate it before sending to Google Drive.  It automatically removes blank pages.  If you put in a stack of 10 pages and accidentally tell it \"group\" or \"single documents\" when you meant the other one, it lets you change that before sending.  It scans double-sided documents very quickly.<br /><br />I have never used any of the expense report features.  Not part of my life or job.<br /><br />When I first got it I used NeatCloud.  It's nice to have the auto-OCR, but the service is ridiculously overpriced.  We dropped that at the end of the free trial period and set up Google Drive.  Since then, it's been perfect.<br /><br />Sending one document from NeatCloud to PDF is easy, but trying to do that for multiple documents is not.  It was a big hassle to convert documents in NeatCloud to PDF to put in the Google Drive.  You can't drag and drop. You can't tell it \"download all to PDFs in folders\" which is a feature it needs.  I would recommend that you never even waste your time with the NeatCloud service.<br /><br />I see others have had problems with the document feeder.  Not me.  [Updated below]  90% of the time it pulls everything down correctly on the first try.  The other 10% of the time I have to give it a little pat on top and then they all go through perfectly.  It does a good job of pulling apart papers even when I have removed a staple and it has those little paper prong-things that happens when you staple and then remove a staple.  I keep expecting it to fail but it hasn't yet.<br /><br />I see others have had problems with scanned documents not showing up.  I have not had that problem once, either with NeatCloud or with Google Drive.  Hard to say how many total documents I have scanned but my guess is something like 500 files, maybe total 3,000 pages.<br /><br />The elephant in the room is tech support.  The thing has worked perfectly, so I've never called them.  [Updated below]  I believe everyone who says they suck and I am worried about my rage level if I ever do have to deal with them.  Honestly I feel guilty writing a positive review because I hate to let them get away with under-funding customer support, but my experience with the product has never required me to call them.<br /><br />The bottom line is that the thing is super duper convenient.  I knew I should be scanning every important thing at home like I do at work, and I never did it because I didn't want to hassle with it.  Now I do scan everything and I have access to my files everywhere because scanning them takes ten seconds and then I throw all the paper in the recycling bin.<br /><br />*UPDATE<br /><br />I have now been using the Neat for over a year.  I still use it several times per week.  I have had some minor problems with it, and tech support has not fixed the problem that I brought to them.  That said, I'm still very happy with it and would buy it again.  I am leaving everything above even though it's outdated so that the review shows both how well it worked after seven months and after a year.<br /><br />I have started having problems with the document feeder.  For months it worked by just hitting the \"scan\" button 90% of the time.  Now, it works like that 25% of the time, and the other 75% of the time I have to tap the documents to push them down slightly to get the scan started.  So far it has only been requiring that one pat; the other documents in the stack get pulled down after the first one goes.<br /><br />I note that I have started scanning stacks of differently-sized pieces of paper.  I'm impressed that I can put in regular letter-size paper plus legal size plus \"check stub\" 2/3 size all in the main compartment of the scanner, plus receipts in the receipt compartment, and it scans all of them with one press of the button (or one press of the button plus a pat on top).  So, overall I'm still impressed with the document feeder.  I do have to push the documents down most of the time, but to me that is an acceptable level of functioning.  I would not have even listed it among the problems, but others have mentioned it and above I said it didn't happen to me, so I felt like I should include it.<br /><br />Another minor problem has appeared.  When you scan things into Google Drive, it gives them a file name like this: \"NeatConnect_03_02_2015_10_49_03\" - which is \"NeatConnect_month_day_year_hours_minutes_seconds\".  The time is wrong.  It's off by six hours exactly.  Has to be set to the wrong time zone, right?  So I tried to find the time zone setting and couldn't find anything like that.  I emailed Neat tech support from their website.  I got an email from a customer support person and he was asking me to check this and that and email him back with more information.  I did.  I went back and forth with the guy through several emails and I thought he was very helpful.  Then, before he ever suggested any kind of fix, he just stopped emailing me.  I have now emailed him twice to say \"Haven't heard back from you - what should I do?\" and I have no response.<br /><br />So, I'm not completely 100% impressed by the thing any more, but I'm still giving it five stars, because I still love it.  It has made a big difference in my life.  I know I could get any old scanner and have access to my documents from Google Drive, but the bottom line is that I'm not going to do that.  Life at home is too busy for me to be able to turn on the computer, sit down, and scan everything in.  But life is not too busy for me to wake up the Neat Connect, drop in the documents, hit \"scan,\" tap them to get them going down into the scanner, and then walk away.  That takes me a few seconds even now that I have to give it the little tap.  Now my documents are waiting for me in Google Drive whenever I do have time to name them and put them into folders - or even if I never do spend the time to do that.",

            "question": "title: Could be more user-friendly, but still a solid, versatile machine.\ntext: The printer comes boxed very carefully, and has a number of little safeguards in the machine that need to be removed before use. Getting the machine plugged in, all the parts moving, etc, was simple enough, and I thought the ink process was particularly interesting. The screen guides you through inserting each cartridge, with a carousel-type of thing that forwards to each slot for the different colors of ink. It took another 10 minutes for the machine to clean the printer heads, align the ink, etc, which seemed a bit excessive. Will it do that each time I change the ink?<br /><br />Getting the printer to work wirelessly with our computers was a little more complicated, and required the disk on both PCs. The disc installs the machine as both a scanner *and* a printer, with software to control the settings of the scanner function. Although it took some time, the printer is now working well on the network with our computers. Printing is fast and the quality looks good. The copier works as expected. The scanner has a few options for output - scan to PC, scan to email, scan to USB, etc. I've been working through all of them, and while they are great features, I will say it's not nearly as intuitive as my HP Envy printer. It's just a clunkier process, though still useful.<br /><br />The machine itself is larger than most, but still reasonable for desk-top use. The ink is affordable to replace, which is good, since we have four kids in school who will be using it often for papers and such. It'll take me forever to remember it's not a touch screen, but I'll survive. (but honestly - why not a touch screen??) Overall, though I think some of the processes could be more streamlined and user-friendly, this is a solid machine for a variety of moderate to heavy home uses.",

Magnets No So Much.\ntext: My wife has complained for a while that we’ve used a large number of clothes pins in the kitchen for closing up bags of chips and popcorn.

It’s a good solution though not perfect, the main issue being the weak magnets.<br /><br />These are brightly colored clips and there are 15 in the set – and every one of them has a unique color. Though this is a colorful set as such, the colors don’t serve too much purpose other than aesthetic appeal. That is, there’s no way to label these without adding a glob of tape. That’s not a criticism in the least, but using a specific color for a specific purpose will take an understanding among members of the household.<br /><br />Even though these have a small area of contact between the jaws, these grip well and we’ve had no trouble with these keeping even larger bags closed (when we fold or roll the bag decently, of course). These are fine clips for the main purpose they serve.<br /><br />Where these fail is in the magnets that are supposed to make them suitable for tacking things to a metal surface. The magnets are weak, enough so that much more than a sheet of paper makes these slide down a refrigerator door if there’s nothing in the way to stop them.<br /><br />These are good bag clips and they work well as bag clips.

It will scan one side or both. It comes with fantastic software that converts scanned pages to Word or other office software for editing. You can also save scanned pages as jpg images, tiff images, PDF files, or more. The setup was easy and the software package is great. It's worth the large download. A word of warning--it is a large download. If you have a slow DSL connection, set your computer and do something else for a few hours. You have to download the software and let it update itself before connecting the scanner to the computer. The directions are pretty good, and the scanner is very well packed. That said, be sure you should check not just the top, but also under the document feed lid to make sure you have removed all the blue tape. While primarily a document-feed scanner, it will also scan photos and flat artwork (up to 8.5 x 14&#34;) on the flatbed surface. Just lift up the document feeder. If you need to archive personal or office records, this will make your job a lot easier. I may also use it to convert some ancient typed manuscripts into editable files. It will be so much easier than loading one page at a time on a standard flatbed scanner.",

I have a bad back, so I use it for transporting moderately heavy grocery and hardware store purchases (e.g., cases of bottled water, bags of mulch or potting soil) from my car to my house.  I also use it to move indoors the large boxes that FedEx, UPS, and USPS deliver to my front door.  And I use it to shift loaded 14-gal. and 18-gal. [[ASIN:B0014CVDA4 Rubbermaid Roughneck]] tubs around my house and garage.<br /><br />A feature I find particularly useful is the bright yellow, heavy-duty, nylon pull rope.  It makes it possible to move boxes (carefully) without strapping them down.  It's a bit tricky to control the loaded dolly with just the rope, but you learn quickly enough.  A word of caution:  the pull rope can be a trip hazard, if you don't pay attention to where you drop it--I learned the hard way!<br /><br />The dolly is lightweight, and very easy to carry with the built-in handle.  It stores standing upright on one end, and takes up little garage space.

            "question": "title: 3M/Scotch Tape Gun well made, safer to use, but blades not replaceable, so expensive over time\ntext: The 3M/Scotch ST-181 tape gun is well made, and has a retractable tape cutting blade which makes it safer to use than most of the cheaper alternatives.  Most tape guns have an exposed blade which is easy to brush against, injuring the user or someone else in the work area (or when you have the tape dispenser stored, between uses), or clothing or packages.  Duck and ULine also have OEM units with retractable blades, but you will have to shop around for those, the 3M/Scotch is much easier to find. The body of the ST-181 unit is steel, as is the cutting area and blade, blade slider and tensioner.  The tape roller is a hard plastic, as is the tape spool (which is adjustable, tension wise) and wiper.  Pushing on the wiper pivots the blade for cutting the tape.  The handle is plastic with a foam cover, it is comfortable, although over time the open foam can collect a bit of dust and dirt, gets greasy, can be hard to clean (a unit with a rubberized handle will generally be better in this regard).  The ST-181 can also use a variety of 3M/Scotch and other brand packaging tapes, the tape is threaded past a retention/tension device, over the roller and past the blade and clear plastic wiper.  You can start taping the box on the side, use the roller across the top, and then push down on the wiper as you go around the edge, this should cut the tape and press it down, with practice this goes all pretty simply.  Turning the small wheel on the tape hub lets you adjust how much tension there is, which is needed for different types of tape.  This works well with 2\" wide tape on a 3\" cardboard hub, from 3M and others.  Tape is replaceable, and sold in bulk.  There are a couple of tricks to buying this, 3M/Scotch sells it with and without one or two tapes, price those out as frequently with tape will be cheaper than without (which makes no sense, but...).  3M makes a lot of different tapes, it is generally a very good brand.  Shipping tape generally has better adhesion, storage tape holds for longer and is less susceptible to temperature swings.  The kind of caveat on this unit is that the blade is not replaceable, it is held on with two screws, but 3M does not sell replacements, so as the blade dulls with usage, you will have to replace the whole unit.  Normally the safety of the retractable blades and padded handle would make this a good choice for commercial, but the lack of replaceable blades means it should be used more for light office or home only.",

            "question": "title: No USB connection necessary!\ntext: I had the opportunity to order and review the new HP OfficeJet Pro 8025 All-in-One Wireless Printer, with Smart Tasks. My past experience with HP products has led me to stay clear from them because of all the bloatware software that is (in my experience) buggy. With that said, I would like to share my thoughts on this printer.<br /><br />First off I would like to say that I am extremely pleased with the HP OfficeJet Pro 8025. Just the fact that you can set it up without having to connect it to your computer via USB cable first, was huge! My last HP Printer and Software was so buggy and would lose connection randomly until I moved it from it’s remote location and re-connected it to the computer via the USB cable. Then I would have to move it again to it’s remote location. Needless to say that was very annoying. The 8025 was super easy to set up via WiFi and start using right away with zero issues.<br /><br />Setting up the WiFi was quite easy with the touchscreen and I never had to make any physical connection to the PC via USB cable. This makes me very happy! Setting up the HP OfficeJet Pro 8025 for my Windows 10 PC, Android mobile device and Chromebook was an absolute breeze. For Windows 10 you need only to install the free App from the Windows App Store (without all the unnecessary Bloatware). The Android device was just as simple as downloading the App from the play store. Setting up to print from my Chromebook was as easy as making sure that I was connected to the same WiFi Network and searching for printers via the printer settings on the Chromebook, then add the HP 8025.<br /><br />At first set up, I did have some issues with the printer to where it would pull through several sheets of paper every time it would print test pages. This was a huge disappointment,  however this issue has seemed to correct itself and it has not happened since but I thought it was worth mentioning. It totally could have been user error on my part when placing a small stack of paper into the paper tray for the initial set up process.<br /><br />This printer has the capability to connect to your Google Drive and DropBox accounts (via the included “Apps” settings) so that you may print FROM them and Copy/Scan TO them. This was “fairly” easy to set up to my Google Drive account but I have yet to try DropBox as I don’t use that as often. This feature alone will make it so much more convenient for my daughter who uses Google Drive exclusively for her School Homework.<br /><br />You can also send copies/scans from the printer, to email addresses. This is a little cumbersome through the small touchscreen but I do love this feature. Speaking of the small touchscreen - it will prove challenging for those with long fingernails but it is doable ;)<br /><br />I also tested out the FAX feature that is included with the HP OfficeJet Pro 8025 and although this is a dying technology, it’s still used by many businesses as I have found. I am happy to report that the FAX feature works great, and though I won’t use it a lot, I am grateful that HP included this feature with this model.<br /><br />The 8025 also has included \"Smart Tasks\" which basically allows you to set up (via the mobile app) tasks such as scanning a document and print directly to your Printer or send to Google Drive, DropBox, OneDrive, Box, Evernote, Quickbooks or an e-mail address. I use this feature currently to scan received invoices from my Android device and send directly to my Google Drive. It places this scan into a designated folder under another folder called \"HP Smart\". You can create several different \"tasks\" on the Mobile App to simplify things that you would do on a regular basis. This is an incredibly simple and useful feature that I will be using more often.<br /><br />In conclusion HP has changed my views with this printer, and I highly recommend the OfficeJet 8025 for those in need of a compact All-in-One Wireless Copy/Scan/FAX Printer",

In fact, it's almost identical to what I use to hold my work ID in every day. Which technically, could be used as a wallet, but it's so thin, that it's a bit difficult to get cards in and out and of the slots. There are 3 slots on the back. Whatever you slide in there needs to be thin. You can't put in 3 bank card type items because of the thickness. Plus whatever you put in the lower slot will hang out over the middle and top slots if it's a standard business card sized item. I prefer a tiered look, so I haven't been putting anything in the lower slot. The material feels plastic, but it does smell like leather. The cord is really thin, but so far it's been adequate. I like the RFID feature, but I can't really test that out. Overall, it's okay. It will work if you really don't have much to carry around and you just want to use it for your ID, a bank card, & a little bit of cash, but if you have more than that to carry around, you're probably going to want something a little bigger.",

With other, older V-Tech models, I've had to go to the base station voice recorder to do this.<br />* The ability to switch calls between handsets and to conference call with multiple handsets.  Past V-Tech phones I've owned didn't allow this.  If you were on a call and another handset was switched on, the call would terminate.<br />* Small base station voice recorder takes up very little space<br /><br />The cons<br /><br />* Sound quality of speaker phone could be better.  It sounds tinnier than past V-Tech phones I've owned.  The sound is a bit garbled at times too.<br />* No belt clip.  Having a belt clip frees up both hands while talking.<br />* Flat buttons.  This is a trivial point, but worth mentioning for some prospective buyers.  The flat buttons offer a nice sleek look, but they inhibit touch dialing.  The \"5\" button has a raised nib to help you detect your fingers position on the keypad, but the flat buttons are still less tactile and effective for touch dialing.<br />* This model is almost the exact size and shape as my Logitech remote control.  Because of this, I often pickup the wrong device when looking for it bu touch.  This really isn't V-Tech's fault - it's more of a personal quip.",

            "question": "title: Brilliant Colors, Highly Pigmented, Handy To Use, And No Caps To Lose!\ntext: One of the things I like to do when correcting papers or making notes that I want to stand out is have a selection of nice different colored pens that have different colored ink in them.<br /><br />WHAT ARE THESE PENS LIKE?<br />These click pens are covered over half of the barrel in a soft grippy plastic that indicates what color ink is inside the pen.  The front of the pen has a clear plastic front on it which is tinted with that same color but is see through.  The ink itself is very bright and pigmented.  The ink tube inside is filled about halfway up the pen, but is larger around than most ball point pens.  There is a plastic tip on the pen to keep the ink from flowing when you first get it, so you have to remove it with your fingernail or something similar.<br /><br />HOW DO THESE PENS WORK?<br />The pens are surprisingly smooth and write very well.  There is enough drag so that I don't feel as if I am losing control of the pen, but not so much that it is hard to write with.  The ink does not seem to blob up much when using, but I did notice that if you hit the writing just right, it will smear a tiny bit.  It is not that bad, however, and I would not say it is a big problem.  The colors are all very brilliant and heavily pigmented, making these look like the perfect marriage between ball point pen and gel pen.<br /><br />WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THESE PENS<br />-colors are all brilliant<br />-smooth to write with<br />-grip well any spot on the pen<br />-don't roll off a desk<br />-no caps to lose<br /><br />WHAT I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THESE PENS<br />-ink should be filled up a bit more<br />-tiny bit of smearing if hand runs over just right<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />If you want a nice pigmented pen in brilliant colors that is easy to use, this click pen is a great choice.  Although it smears slightly from time to time, in general, it is an easy pen to use and pretty classy looking.  The inks are all pigmented and the purple especially is dark enough to be used for general writing when blue or black is usually preferred.<br /><br />For the price of these pens I have rated them four stars due to the slight smearing from time to time and the ink not being as full as I would like to see.  I would rather rate them four and a half stars if I could, however.",

Great value for a functional fountain pen. Mine is a wet write, nib is not as smooth as my higher end pens, but is better than expected. The size is a bit small, but I prefer smaller pens (Sailor Sapparo / Pelikan 200-400 series). I have a few Cross pens and have only had an issue with one of them (A century II with 18k nib). I sent it to Cross and they repaired it, writes beautifully now. The customer service was very impressive, and although my Cross pens are always not my favorites, they stand behind their product and it gave me the confidence to purchase several more (2 Apogees which are very nice, and now 2 Baileys). I bought this Bailey to have as a knock around pen, that I wouldn't have to worry about scratching / breaking. So more of a daily note taker for me. I've only filled it once at this point, so the ink I am using may just be a thin ink. I would prefer a fine nib option on this if it continues to write so wet. It does come with two ink cartridges, but does NOT come with a converter. If you prefer to use bottles inks, you will need to purchase the screw in type converter (the one that works with the Apogee), not the push in.",

            "question": "title: greatly reduces all the aches & pains from tailbone pressure; works great on my computer chair\ntext: This Luckylife gel seat cushion measures roughly 17\" x 17\" x 1\"<br /><br />I am a bigger person, and it seems appropriate to my size and needs. I use it on my office chair, where I am always wishing for a little more cushioning. My chair aggravates my back, and while I use a back cushion, it was dawning on me that a little support in the bum area would provide better care. I did try a seat cushion, but it was too thick and firm. It changed the way my chair worked, and I found that I rarely used it. When this cushion came up as an option, the information in in the product description as well as the overall look intrigued me.<br /><br />The cushion is thin but dense. If you really needed a thicker cushion but still made of this material, I would just buy a second one and double up. The material used, TPE(ultra-flex polymer) is neat. It is a jelly like material in shape of honeycombs. The pad has a zip on cover that has little nubs on one side to help grip whatever you are using it on. Basically less likely to slide of your chair.<br /><br />I didn't notice any major changes right away. Well, I noticed that it was comfortable to sit on and that it seemed to form to my body. It was after using it for a few days and being at my computer for long periods of time that I realized that I wasn't feeling the usual odd aches in my legs, hip, back. My back wasn't aching as I get out of my chair. So while I have only been using it for a week, it has been a good week.<br /><br />So depending on your needs.. this might be good for you. If you need a more firm pad, look elsewhere. This is super flexible, and super squishy. I am not sure how it is working, but at least for my needs it seems to be helping. I think the too frim pads (or lack of pad) exacerbate an easily pinched nerve. This seems to cradle my body and alleviate the tension.<br /><br />Also, it is somehow cool feeling. Not sure if is actually cool, or if it is the design (honeycomb) which may allow for more air flow?<br /><br />The cover is super thin yet durable.<br /><br />I read another review that said theirs stunk. I hadn't noticed anything, but I decided to pick it up and take a whiff. There is a faint, unpleasant odor. If it were strong, I imagine it would be unusable. But for mine, I didn't notice it until I sniffed for it.<br /><br />Like I said, this pad happens to be working for my needs, in my computer chair. I would consider taking it to restaurants as most of the chairs offered really hurt my back (which stems from pressure on butt/tailbone area). Since this is lightweight and flexible, I think it could easily be carried in a large purse, or simply as it. Be comfortable where you can!<br /><br />I am giving it a solid 4/4.5 star rating. It's still early on in my use, but I am enjoying it so far. It has been great to use. I hope it holds up and continues to be good for my tailbone. I think it is worth the try.",

But when i started playing with it, I learned a few more things. First, the \"backer\" for holding the photos in place does have little \"L\" brackets that snap into place depending on the size of your photo. (It supports sizes up to 6 x 8 inch). Theres a small screen to show what you're about to capture and a simple scan and save captures the photo to an SD card. That, of course, can easily be transfered to your computer for saving, sharing, whatever.<br /><br />One thing that didn't occur to me... Many years ago, when I was taking a lot of 35 mm pictures, I would save the negatives... didn't know why, just seemed like the thing to do. But what can you do with them now? This unit will handle them. Theres a plastic slide tray made just for these old negatives - you place the strip inside and snap it closed, then slide in from the side and capture those shots as photos! (Not just as the negative of a photo) Nice!<br /><br />As for picture quality, its pretty good - they do offer 2 resolutions and theres some provision for adjustments built it, but that seems a little tedious. Once in my computer, I'll be able to do a better job of \"fixing\" old faded images with software, anyway.",

I have wanted one of these triangular rulers for a while, not just for the cool factor but more for the stability. So far I am pleased with this one.<br /><br />One of the things that I have been burned by in the past was inaccurate scales. I had one tape measure that supposedly measured in inches but the measurement was off, such that it measured 6\" where all other rulers and tape measures showed 5\". As such, I always check these for accuracy as a result. This ruler is accurate - 1\" is actually 1\" and not something else.<br /><br />For my typical use, though, the ability to measure is not as important is it is to get straight, clean lines. This straight edge does a fine job for me and right out of the package is clean and pristine. Being aluminum I expect it to hold an edge indefinitely, though it is susceptible to nicks and dents if not careful with it. The shape gives me more control over the ruler so it is less likely to slide.<br /><br />I like with weight, too. It is a little more hefty than a plastic or wooden ruler but it is still very lightweight and easy to handle.<br /><br />I am happy with this ruler. It meets my need and it is scaled accurately. It's very well-priced too which is an added bonus.",

The ink cartridges need to be firmly inserted after removing the plastic plunge cartridge to draw ink from other sources. I could both hear and feel a 'pop' when the ink cartridge was firmly installed. Replace the barrel and the cap covering the nib and tap a few times on a firm surface to get the ink flowing to the nib.

This is a great deal and too good to pass on! I have always bought the plain white ‘name’ brands, like Bounty or Vanity Fair, etc., in a Walgreens, CVS, or another regular store. They usually cost about $5.00 +/- for a pack of 50 napkins. With these, the price is much less and you also get colorful napkins that are perfect for the kitchen. You would think that the quality would be compromised for being so cheap, but it's not. I have been using the same one now for several days and it's still not ready for the garbage! Granted, I haven't used it to eat a messy dinner, but it works well for my coffee, tea, and other beverages, and protects my white Corian kitchen counters and wood table. Even if you wanted to use these for a sloppy meal, so what? - they are so inexpensive that it's not a shame to throw them out. The pattern is on the 4 sides that show when the napkins are open, and the other side is plain white. These aren't the softest around, but would still be ok to wipe your mouth. The pack of 150 came in 2 plastic-wrapped packs of 75 in each. None of them were damaged or wrinkled, like some others are when you get them off the shelf in a regular store! To me, that says a lot about the care and quality control by the manufacturer. I have some of these in a holder on the kitchen table, which looks much better than the pure white ones (I used to keep those in a cabinet or drawer! I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is looking for these colors. They are even appropriate for a party or other occasions. I am the first person to write a review, even though the little bit they have were all 5*’s. *** Since I buy items that are not familiar to me on Amazon based on the reviews of others, if you find this to be helpful please mark it as such for future reference, thanks!",

This is a great way to protect your favorite fountain pen, etc. However, there's a possible flaw - the pouch is too snug for a standard barrel fountain pen. If the cap to your pen doesn't screw on, you'll have difficulty getting the pen out of this case. When.you pull on the cap, the cap comes out and the rest of the pen stays behind. I have 3 of these in different colors- the worst is described as \"thick\" leather. The thicker leather is stiffer and therefore tighter. The one with a thinner softer leather is more workable. Still a problem, but not as much. Might want to consider buying a version designed for 2 pens, then use it for one. Otherwise, a very nice pen case.",

I hate having my name and address on papers that I won't keep, so having a shredder comes in handy. This Amazon Basics seems well built and has lasted me quite a while thus far. I haven't had to clean it yet, though the only issue I have is that it can take less papers than the ones we have in the office. I have to make sure the papers are straightly aligned, and since the shredder's in a corner it can be a wee bit difficult sometimes to make sure all edges are straight.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's fine.

Things start to get a little wonky once we get past the 400,000-page mark, However, we stay loyal because it prints super fast  (nearly 1 sheet per second), it's compact, and we have an extra print tray, so, it's cost-effective.  We always have extra toner cartridges/drums and this wifi printer installs quickly on all of our Mac/PC computers.<br />With two thriving eCommerce sites, we rely on this compact business/consumer-grade laser printer every day of the week for our shipping labels, packing slips, invoices and office documents. We cannot afford to have an unreliable printer and the HL-L6200DW series has performed well with heavy use.  I also use an HP laser printer at home and according to the reviews,  it has about the same lifespan, at a much higher price. Thank goodness my home office needs aren't as demanding and in all honesty, I think the two manufacturers are about the same in performance, longevity and print quality and speed. I like the HP software somewhat better, but I don't think it is worth the extra $100+ for a printer of equal quality.<br /><br />Toner Lock Bypass:<br /> Open the toner access door on your printer.<br />• Press the Secure and Cancel buttons at the same time.<br />• Use the arrow buttons to select the correct toner yield of the toner you are using<br />TNR-STR = Starter cartridge<br />TNR-STD = TN-820 standard yield<br />TNR-HC = TN-850 high yield<br />TNR-S.HC = TN-880 super high yield<br /><br />It's a fast printing workhorse at a budget-friendly price.",

But if you want a pen that you can use daily for extended periods (writing in a journal, taking notes in class, etc.), yeah, not such a good choice.<br /><br />The pen has no ergonomic features -- the barrel is smooth (no \"grip,\" no textured area, etc.), which means that your hand will slide down the pen if using it for longer than 15 minutes or so.  So you either have to keep repositioning the pen or grip it tighter, neither of which is a great option.  I realize that adding even some thin rubber \"grip lines\" would likely spoil the sleek design, and maybe the target demographic for this pen is the \"very occasional use\" folks.  But bear in mind that if you need a pen that will hold up to lots of use without causing your hand to cramp, this probably isn't the best alternative.<br /><br />That said, it's a very nice looking pen in a nice presentation box, and would make a great gift (maybe graduation?).

Otherwise they look too much alike.  Let's see how these worked out.<br /><br />WHAT ARE THESE LIKE?<br />These labels come in a box dispenser.  They come out in a roll and they can be removed one at a time and the others are protected in the box.<br /><br />HOW DO I USE THESE?<br />I use these mainly to cut into fourths and label essential oil roller bottles with.  I then label them in permanent ink and use packaging tape to wrap on top of it as it protects it from some of the oil.<br /><br />HOW ELSE CAN THESE BE USED?<br />These can be used on file folders, papers, boxes, and even shelves.  If you plan to use these on plastic boxes, be sure to put a piece of packaging tape over top of them to be sure they stick and are protected.<br /><br />ARE THEY EASY TO WRITE ON?<br />I use a Sharpie or other permanent marker with a point and they seem to do very well with these.  Not a lot of bleeding or issues.<br /><br />DO THEY WORK WELL AS A LABEL?<br />On paper they work great and don't need help to stick.  On more slick surfaces like plastic and glass, I put the piece of packaging tape over top.  You can still read it and it is protected and stays in place.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />These stickers are easy to see, are easy to dispense, and are easy to use for me on roller bottles.  They have many uses, and in some cases might need a piece of packaging tape (see through) over top just to keep them in place if you are not sure.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.

You can use one for your smaller pens or pencils and then just dump the rest of your pens into the bottom. It also has pockets in the front for other various items you might need. It wouldn’t fit a ton of stuff, but maybe a couple kinds of washi, some white out, some paper clips or page tabs, an eraser, a small pencil sharpener- that sort of thing.

The wire spiral is durable enough to last the first half of the school year. The cover is a  thick plastic and the back cover is cardboard. The best thing are the dividers have reinforced pockets on each side.  It's perfect for high school where the student can't go to their locker between classes, the one notebook has all classes neatly separated and easily accessible. We would always get a new notebook after the winter/Christmas break.<br /><br />Only suggestion to the manufacturer would be to double the paper thickness and halve the number of pages - heavy ball point pens can bleed through as it is today.<br /><br />Now that he is in college he has a seperate notebook for each class, making his or her load lighter and the potential for losing all his notes when he misplaces his notebook is reduced 80 percent - lol. Looking back we sent our young man off to freshman year in Orange & Red, Sophomore year was Green & Blue, Junior year  Orange & Green, Senior Year was Black & White.<br /><br />My second impression came from the weight. The notebook is heavy. Unless a student needs to take notes on five projects in one class or has no time between classes, the notebook is probably heavier than most students would want to carry. When more and more teachers are using on-line notes and projects, I'm not sure who might find this notebook useful.",

Problem we were having, the small nuts, bolts, screws are so tiny and if dropped… They go MIA. Especially, if working over carpet or- at a higher counter level! These tiny pieces of hardware love to bounce and hide-<br />Tbh, I didn’t know this item existed and thought I had revolutionized the world with my million $ making idea- plan was to Patton a magnetized placemat… and retire! However, when I popped that brilliance into Google a “how to” search engine- I was kicked in the gut to find, I could already buy this item of mine on Amazon! Of course, I could! At least I felt smart for a tiny hot second.. thinking it up on my own- and along with the someone else who, was a step ahead and had earned my money maker.. dammit! Next time, definitely next time...<br />As for the product, it works just as one would expect. It is simply just that, a placemat to do ones task on and one with impressive powers- this has a good amount of grab to keep items from falling off if dropped or set down on top of it. And it’s easy to remove… It’s a nice amount of give/take.<br />If small eyeglass type/size screw is placed on the mat- you could pick it up horizontally without items falling off. On the flipside, one rough shake will release (not that you’re wanting to do that! Just giving the idea of the holding power!!) trust me, the small items and wheel bearings my son is working with, would make the back of an earring look massive.. so, this mat has saved many of hours on hands/knees combing floor with a magnet- so, for any who work with tiny object such as this.. it’s worth it’s weight in gold!<br />This also comes with a magnetic pen to pick up small items as well… he uses that more like a novelty item. This would be helpful for those who have trouble seeing some of the smaller parts.<br />This also has a grid system for any specific parts needing to be placed together.. in specific boxes marked on the magnet board, you can arrange your items keeping them compartmentalized… Amazing!<br />This comes in a slide in/out plastic cover and if you open appropriately… You can use cover to store item when not in use- we did this and love that it’s easy to keep together or take on the go.<br />For any who work with smaller objects at just over $5, this is a great item to have..

            "question": "title: Gadgety, but NOT Practical\ntext: I hate these.<br /><br />First, the stickiness of the 'regular' Post-its are much stronger.  With the originals, I can stick and re-stick several times to our bathroom mirror (helpful for weekly reminders and the like), as well as to my office door (&#34;I'm in 248 today&#34;).  With these, they fail after one or two moves.  Even when just sticking them to a single surface, you will find that they are easier to pull/fall off.  I have tested them side-by-side, and the 'normal' notes consistently outperform these.  You can see this yourself if you stick a normal pad of Post-it notes into the pop-up dispenser.  You can pick up the dispenser with the stickiness of the normal notes, whereas the pop-ups come out 'cleanly'.  Or just put them on a table side-by-side, like I did, and see which one comes up more easily.<br /><br />Second, these are more expensive than regular Post-its.  How so, you ask?  Well, they are incredibly frustrating to use without a dispenser, so you really shouldn't buy them unless you also buy one of those.  That will set you back another $5-10 on top of the notes (although it is reusable).<br /><br />Finally, to use these with the dispenser, you HAVE to write on them AFTER you pull them off the pad.  If you are posting them to a wall or other vertical surface, this generally means sticking them to a table or some such, writing, then moving them elsewhere.  Since they are already weaker (see #1), this greatly increases the chances of them falling off by accident.<br /><br />In short, these are 'neat' and 'gadgety', but not actually practical.  Use these as a fun little party trick.  Stick to the plain old &#34;boring&#34; Post-its when you actually need to make sure your message gets across.",

With just the adhesive that is on them, so GREAT DEAL.

Weeks with rain, humidity, heat and they're still sticking to the cement block!  I have my super glue on hand should they loosen, but so far, so VERY good!<br />_______________________<br /><br />I bought two, one for each of two parking space cement bumpers in front of my apt.  I KNOW it doesn't say to use for that, although it does say INDOOR/OUTDOOR (which likely means just an outside door or wall, but still it does say OUTDOOR).<br /><br />WILL UPDATE my comments after some time has gone by.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />QUALITY/PRESENTATION:  THESE look exceptionally good!  Not cheap, they look like something you would see in a professional building.  Silver gray letters on a black background.

Well, the markers that I bought (which said &#34;does not bleed through paper&#34;) bled through the thick paper of my planner. I immediately searched for a new set of markers. I read through the questions for these pens and this topic had been addressed by a few customers. I am very happy to say that these markers do not bleed through!!! I am using the Happy Planner for everything other than my calendar and these pens don't bleed through to the other side. I have a different planner for my family calendar and it doesn't bleed through it either. This set has a great variety of colors. The pens are triangular in shape so they don't roll around which is a nice feature.",

This does not happen as quickly with a wrist rest as this one. I like this one because it cleans easily with a damp cloth and has a nice shape that contours to my wrist. It certainly allows me to play point-and-click games much longer without sore wrists! Ideally, we would use a rest long before wrist pain is an issue! I'd recommend this to anyone that may do activities that would lead to wrist fatigue. Thanks for reading my review, I hope it was helpful and you kindly will click the button below!",

I finally realized that this pain was correlated to days spent sitting in this chair specifically. I wasn't a fan of the lumbar support already but decided to remove it. Unfortunately the Phillips head screws that secure the lumbar support to the back of the chair air pointed toward the netting, making them difficult to access without special tooling (a ratchet screwdriver for instance).<br /><br />The seat is also incredibly squeaky after a year of mixed use.

The first roll worked so well, I immediately ordered a second roll when my supply dwindled.  I use these stickers on almost a daily basis for bottles of nail polish I sell online.  They stick to the bubble mailers I use beautifully. Once a sticker is on the mailer, that's where it stays.  They don't lift up, unpeel or tear.  A few have been outside in light rain while waiting to be picked up by the post office and they STILL stayed on the mailer envelope. They're easy to remove from the roll as well and the bright red color of the sticker alerts everyone that the package is to be handled carefully. I've yet to receive one complaint of a polish bottle breaking. They're an excellent size and the price can't be beat, especially when we're talking about 1,000 labels per roll.

The surface of the stand is a faux leather that prevents anything on it from slipping. On the top of it is an insert in which you can place your phone or the book stand that is secured for storage on the underside of the stand. On the bottom end of it is a little ledge that prevents your laptop and your mouse from sliding off. In addition there is a little grove in which you can put some pens or the little laptop stopper if you think the ledge is not enough.<br /><br />On the left side is a little drawer in which you can keep your mouse, USB cables, pens, laptop stopper and other small items in. The legs can be raised up so you can adjust it to what you prefer. They are wide enough apart to give you plenty of space. In addition the angle of the top can be changed as well so you can adjust to to your preference. When you are done everything can be folded neatly to one flat surface that be easily stored away.<br /><br />This is a very nicely put together laptop table.

I accessed the PDF version of the single folded oversized page online at the Canon website that is printed on the box and printed a copy which looks to be a reduced version of exactly the same paper, so now I have one clean and unfolded pair of papers in addition to the folded and wrinkly large sheet.<br /><br />As for the actual printing calculator, it is better then the last one I purchased, a Casio that is about 20+ years old and still functional, in that it is clean and new and close to the same size.  It uses the same size rolls of paper, some things never change, but be aware that this one comes out of the box with one of the small test rolls.  If you intend to print on paper, stock up because the included roll is about an inch diameter and that includes a thick cardboard core which leaves you with about 1/2 inch maximum thickness on the roll.  The ink roller is a replaceable CP-16, good to know if you print a lot.  Included in the box is a set of 4 AA batteries but there is no AC adapter in the box, so you'll have to purchase that separately.  It plugs into the rear of the unit, behind the paper holder wire.  I do not care for the wire due to its small gauge and lack of any holding contraption to keep the roll in the calculator and not unwound on the floor behind the desk if it's been knocked over.  This is a pet peeve of many printing calculators for me because I've experienced the flying paper roll too many times.  It seldom occurs with full rolls, but these little ones seem to grow wings as the paper is depleted and the roll becomes lighter.<br /><br />Functionally, this calculator does what is described, having the currency conversion and cost-sell-margin functions escalate it to the level above basics.  Because the paper roll flows so freely, I would not call it a &#34;Handheld&#34; printing calculator as it's described on the box, but with a little creativity, I will be fabricating something to keep the roll in place so that I can use it in the hand and not on the desk to try it out.  It is described as &#34;Desktop&#34; on Amazon and that's what I'd call it.",

He does this to save on dish washing afterwards. This scale only measures up to 17 ounces and most of our mixing bowls weigh more than that empty.

My last chair was wood, it had cross beams near the bottom and I liked to rest my feet on them.  So would anyone under seven feet tall, which made it so disappointing when the cross beam broke and compromised the chair leg (there was a smallish crack in it and the chair seemed wobbly).  With metal frame and overall great construction of this chair, I can rest my legs with peace of mind, no broken chairs for me!!!<br /><br />2.  Looks exactly like the photo.  All black and the exact dimensions that were listed here.<br /><br />Here's what I didn't like;<br /><br />1.  Missing hardware.  there was spots for six screws to secure the seat to the base and yet only two screws were included.  Sure, it seemed sturdy, but why not have all six points locked down?<br /><br />2.  this is not a seat for lounging.  In fact, the butt space is a on the small side, even my skinny teen found the seat to be a bit wee.

The difference between these and regular colored pencils like Crayola is that these are soft and will permit you to blend and layer colors similar in the way that oil paints do. They lay down smoothly and  with varying degrees of pressure will not streak or show bare spots of uncolored paper. Mine arrived sharpened in the tin and I haven't experienced any core breakage. They are a bit expensive as compared with lower quality pencils, but you have to remember that these are premier premium quality. The old adage &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; in this case certainly rings true. Are there any better? Maybe, possibly, probably but I am well satisfied with their performance.<br /><br />Bottom line: Excellent pencils for those looking to improve their art or just simply to play around with.",

It is a very portable sign holder that can easily hold a foam core sign or other, extremely light signage or art.  But there are some trade offs made by choosing light weight portability.<br /><br />For one this is not a heavy use product.  I would not expect the tent pole bungy technology to survive a lot of abuse, However it is very handy and mades for easy set up and it breaks down to a very nice, packable size.Also the tripod is a little tippy and easily knocked over due to the lack of cross supports which were probably left out for portability.<br /><br />I wouldn't push this tripod with anything weighty.  I have not had problems with the adjustable brackets, but again I am not using anything other than foam core signage.  I would think that weight would risk slippage of the brackets and possible twisting of the legs.<br /><br />Pros<br />+ easily packed<br />+ Easy set up.<br /><br />Cons<br />- Light weight<br />- Tippy<br />- Low holding strength.<br /><br />Summary.<br />This really is a nice solution if you are looking for an easy to pack light weight sign holder.

The other pages between each month have room on each day to write lots of notes, addresses or whatever you need in print large enough to actually read.

            "question": "title: Good multifunctional color laser machine with minimal weaknesses\ntext: With close to a month of usage, the Samsung SL-C1860FW/XAA Wireless Color Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax is providing a much appreciated upgrade to my home office.  Its larger than I'd expected, but I had not researched its size prior to requesting the machine.  The box I received was intact and it required two of us to remove the product from the package.  Setting it up was problematic at first because there was no CD to be found anywhere.  After I'd downloaded the manual from the Samsung website, I finally found the CD hidden inside the box, so if you purchase this and can't find the CD, keep looking.  Enclosed in clear sight was a warranty and two folded pages with installation information.  I found them to be convoluted, but that could be my problem.  I also had difficulty connecting this to my network, and finally was able to connect wirelessly.  I honestly do not know the steps I took, but it does work and it's securely a part of my own network.  The cartridges are easy and quick to install, as is the paper tray.  I was apprehensive with the tray because it was more lightweight than those on the enormous laser printers I used in days past.  Visually, this machine is attractive and boxy, neutral in colors and the screen is very intuitive and clear.  Although not required per the documentation, I downloaded the Samsung software on our smartphones and we are not using this printer in this manner rather than using Google Cloud.  I've not attempted to use the NFC Print via the one smartphone with capabilities only because I haven't needed that yet.<br /><br />Copying is fast and accurate, crisp and clean.  Scans are fantastic and reliable.  The fax I tested was successful.  Printing was equally successful when sent via USB or WiFi.  The option to print configurations is appreciated, as that allows for keeping all information in a folder kept near the printer.  I use the Eco mode because I don't use the machine every day.  I haven't notice warmth around the machine and it is quiet when not functional.  For my home office, the speed of printing is great, and although I likely will not use this for as much dedicated color printing as my other inkjet printers, for documents which include color, this is better than my other printers.  The major weakness for my needs is that this does not have duplex printing.  I have yet to experience a paper jam. I'm far from needing replacement toners, but hope that their prices are reduced before that day comes.  My initial thought regarding the cost of this machine was that it's priced higher than it is worth, but considering the cost of the stuff that goes onto the paper is about the same as this entire package, I guess I won't complain.  If you are in the market for a very good color multifunctional printer, this is definitely worth considering.",

I usually love Amazon but in this case Newegg was much better.  In sum, you really can't find a better combination of features and quality for the price.  The only real complaint I have is that sometimes documents fed through the automatic document feeder aren't 100 percent straight (more like 98 percent straight, but this is only a problem sometimes).<br /><br />PROS:  Auto-duplexing for input and output; 35-page document feeder; great quality when using high print settings; good speed at all settings (unless it's 2-sided); two paper inputs allows you to keep two different papers in the printer at all times, or to just close the top feed if you want; fast and high quality faxing with lots of features (fax isn't just an afterthought in this machine); multiple ink tanks means no disposing of partially full ink cartridges; very good driver software gives you lots of printing options through your computer; many copy, fax and scan options built into the machine and accessible through nice rotating LCD screen; no paper jams yet (UPDATED: Still no jams after over three months of continuous use!).<br /><br />CONS:  It's BIG, as in seriously big and heavy too; like I said above, about one-third of the time documents fed through the document feeder are just the slightest bit off; duplex printing is slow because it stops for ten seconds to let the ink dry on one side before printing the other side; text printed at low quality can be fuzzy, definitely use high print quality for important documents; it's a little on the noisy side and even has a \"quiet mode\" that I haven't tried yet; after two weeks of use I had to run the \"unclog nozzle\" routine to make some black streaking go away (I realize that maintenance is needed sometimes but after just two weeks seems a bit soon); would be nice if it came with a USB cable; photo printing gobbles up ink.<br /><br />Overall so far I'm quite satisfied, though if the document feeder issue gets worse before the one year warranty expires I'll send it to Canon for service.  And if need be I can always place documents on the glass by hand.  Without that issue I'd give it 5 stars.<br /><br />(Note, after 13 months of use this printer fell off a table and stopped working.  So be careful and don't drop your printer.)",

It seems the basket build quality is not on par with the shredding unit. A large crack (pictured) has emerged, and its large enough for paper bits to fall out. Not sure how long it will manage to support the main shredding unit.<br /><br />Quite possible my experience with the crack is a one-off, so will not subtract any stars; plus the price was excellent (about $36 iirc). Highly recommended.",

Only two things I wish were different: 1) the keyboard tray is a little small - just enough room for a keyboard and mouse but not a lot of space to navigate the mouse. It's still a great desk it would just be nice to have a little more room. 2) there is a raised edge around the keyboard tray. Not a problem when standing but when used in the sitting position it rubs on my wrists. Not rough or sharp - just a little annoying pressure. To avoid this I usually pull my keyboard and mouse off when sitting and put it on my regular desk.<br /><br />Overall this is a great desk. I love the infinite locking system and how sturdy it is. I have two monitors and it is very stable regardless of how high it is set. Also I was pleasantly surprised with how big the upper platform is. Plenty of room for both monitors plus mug, planner, etc. which is very helpful when in the standing position. Very pleased with this desk and with it's price tag.

Overall... it wasn't the best purchase.<br /><br />PROS<br />1- Extremely easy setup.  I set it up to work off of my network print server, as well as wirelessly within about 5 minutes.  I was then able to install and setup 2 Mac computers and 3 PC computers within 20 minutes.  All worked fine and printed without issue to the printer.<br />2- Relatively quiet compared to my old HP.<br />3- Print speed<br />4- Price<br /><br />CONS<br />1- Really, the only problem I found with it was the print quality when printing in color.  I was so disappointed.  Like I said, I switched from a 10 year-old HP color laser.  The colors on my HP were vibrant and true to what my photographs showed.  The colors on this printer's (Brother MFC-9840CDW) print-out were horribly washed out and almost made it look like the photographs were actually faded.<br /><br />Although the price of the printer was excellent, I am going to return mine because of the color print quality.  If you don't care about that, this printer is great in every other way.  However, if you are looking for vibrant, true colors, like your photographs show... then I would go with a different printer.",

            "question": "title: Maybe I received a bum unit?\ntext: After waiting for the delivery of this talking travel translator, I now have to wait for it to actually translate. It arrived intact in a little package without much non-recyclable materials, just the disposable plastic case which is easy to open and not much larger than the actual 3/4 of a deck of cards size of the translator. Included was a sheet of paper with 705 English travel related phrases, and a second sheet of paper which is the schematics and operating manual. Both are in English, folded and double-sided. Now for a review of the product.<br /><br />PROS:<br />A voice announces what is on a little screen and you can change the language through any or all 7 options.<br />With one button, you can hear it in your \"Home\" language.<br />Favorites can be saved.<br />It is small and lightweight.<br />If you study this, you can learn phrases and speak them yourself, maybe after showing the display to a person who speaks the language you want to learn.<br />You can enter addresses.<br /><br />CONS:<br />If it needs to be reset or batteries fail, you lose all your addresses and saved favorites and there is no way to backup.<br />It is not very sturdy in the hand and the buttons often have to be depressed more than once.<br />Buttons are small, but the letters on the word imprints are as tiny as a tick before dinner.<br />Arrow buttons don't always work and sometimes simply turn off the device.<br />Digital display scrolls slowly with push of button alone to display the phrase.<br />Backlight button is exactly the reverse of the manual's description and it turns off and on with no apparent logic.<br />Audio quality is lousy with some phrases being unintelligible, even in my native English.<br />Spanish has an extra audio blip on almost all phrase endings.<br />Volume button on the rear feels like it doesn't click into the three levels but slides too freely.<br />Volume often becomes weird with a sound that lasts for minutes of translations.<br />You cannot see a phrase number, then enter the number. You need to scroll through each level and then you can save that phrase as favorite, then scroll through your favorites to access it again.<br /><br />Observations:<br />There are so many phrases with negative connotations that it makes me want to stay at home with the doors locked. Examples include: 661 There is no electricity. 671 There are cockroaches in my room. 672 There is a smell of gas. 139 I have been bitten by a dog. 150 I have been attacked. 151 I have been raped. 162 I would like to speak to a woman. (There is no \"I would like to speak to a man.\") 171 Someone has stolen my..... (You can add another word like -- 474 Eggs, 463 Rib, 484 Pancake, 378 Whisky, 282 Two kilos of....)<br /><br />This translator was a disappointment to me because I expected the \"Over 4900 Travel Related Phrases\" to be phrases and not single words like days of the week, months, numbers, seasons and foods. On the other hand, sports include soccer, tennis, table tennis, golf, baseball, badmitton, and nothing more. I will continue to explore the gadget in the hopes of finding it more useful, but the main impression it made on me is that in order to use this effectively, one must follow the suggestion of phrase number 705, \"Slowly, please.\"",

What I wanted to use these for are my solo LotR: LCG games. That game requires a lot of table space and, while I consolidated some space using dice, there's still a lot of space to save.<br /><br />Once the package arrived, I was surprised--though pleasantly so--to find how heavy the box was. The two stands come packaged in a box, which I keep to put these away in. The stands are solid. I have no concerns of their longevity. There are nice felt bottoms, but they stay in place when I need them. Each slot can fit two double-sleeved cards together, but no more. That's fine, since most of my setup doesn't require more than that. The slots are spaced far apart to allow only the very tops of the cards to be seen when behind another. That's fine for playing cards, but I wish they were spaced just a bit more. C'est la vie.",

The book clips work great; I read a 400+ page hardback book with the clips attached to the covers and the pages free. Left my hands free to grab my lemonade and to pet my dogs! I recently had foot surgery, so I’m using a “knee wheelie” to get around. When I need to move this book stand’s handle fits over my handlebars and it goes with me. I attach the clips to hold down the pages in my book and take off; holds a heavy hardcover book in place while I zoom around, without losing my place in the book!

Instead of pushing the staples along the feeder mechanism, you turn this one upside down and load them from the bottom. The tension can be controlled by the plus or minus lever and all the staples I shot into a pine board were flush. No need to go behind and pound them in. Even with my age and limited hand strength I was able to squeeze the handle to use this. I gave 4 stars originally, but took one off for quality. By the time I had loaded the staples the rubber side inserts were already lose and falling off. They actually are not even pictured here in what I am seeing.

I handed them over to my daughter in law and bought a set of new pencils for myself. I never felt more powerful than the day these arrived. Thank you for pre-sharpening them. I jumped in and made a color chart right away. If you don't do this, you're missing out on a chance to see what they can do before actually committing to a project. Since then I've charted all of my pencils, paints, and pastels. Very satisfying and a great reference tool when I'm looking for the &#34;right&#34; color to work with.<br /><br />The wax based pencils are fabulous. Acquaint yourself with things like wax bloom and fixatives. Minor annoyances but well worth the small amount of time you put in to counter the issues.<br /><br />I recommend the following books if you're a newbie: The Colored Pencil Solution Book by Janie Gildow and Alonya Nickelsen's Colored Pencil Painting Bible.

I have not used it with ink as I am not sure if it would plug up the brush.<br /><br />HOW THIS WORKS<br />I use this to mix micas or other colors of alcohol inks with and drizzle them through the resin for great serendipitous designs.  It works great for that.  The white drags the other colors of mica down into the resin as it sets and it looks beautiful 3D.<br /><br />WHAT ELSE?<br />I have not used this for alcohol ink paintings, although I can and probably will.  I prefer to use it with resin most of the time.  I also do use this for highlights on my watercolor or other media paintings when I need that tiny accent that I want to stay put.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This ink is a great resource to have.  I use it all of the time in resin, but also appreciate having it for highlights, or paintings in the future.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This is great.  I like the larger bottle.

I can move them quickly and store just as much or more in the floor space without straining my back.  I have a LOT of other carts to compare this one to.<br /><br />HOW THIS COMES<br />This comes in a box, well wrapped in plastic and cushioned from damage.  All of the parts are in great bags and the instructions are clear.<br /><br />DOES IT COME WITH TOOLS?<br />This does come with tools, but the Allen Key is a bit flimsy, so you might want to bring out your own if you have them and get better results.  It strips easily.<br /><br />ASSEMBLY<br />The assembly of this cart is not difficult.  It took a bit of pressure to get a few holes lined up, but that was not a big issue.  The shelves are descending in size so you have to be sure to use them in order.  They are clearly marked with numbers again- excellent feature.<br /><br />STURDY<br />This is one of the more sturdy carts I have built.  The shelves are metal and the design is not wobbly like so many of them are when you load them up with semi substantial items.<br /><br />WHEELS<br />The wheels of this cart are again smoother and better made than many of the other carts I have used.  they are metal and rubberized material so they are not cheap plastic.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is a really nice cart.  The space between shelves make it easy to store just about anything I need to store.  The sturdy way that this holds items is much better than others.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.

            "question": "title: Definitely some pros and cons\ntext: This envelope making board has its pros and cons. I had purchased the original gray design with white lettering about 4 years ago. Although the print is small, I could read it without any issue at all. Then when I spotted the new pretty blue and white punch board I thought why not. I<br />use my old one so much that I thought it would be nice to have a much prettier one, ong with a new punch blade to justify my senseless purchase. Big mistake! The pretty new design is extremely difficult to read the tiny print. The background color is blue with white font. I never struggle to read anything, but I do with this.<br />My suggestion is that if you are also having an issue reading yours, just print the measurements out on a piece of paper to store away with the board.<br />The other issue I have is that when making the larger envelopes, the board itself is not large enough to accommodate your paper. And I mean for envelopes only like 4x6 or larger. The paper hangs off the board so you can’t score the entire paper. I have made 100+ envelopes of all sizes so it can be done regardless, but sometimes my score lines are off a bit because of this and I end up with a crooked envelope that can’t be fixed. So I end up having to throw the wonky envelope one in my scrap pile for another project.<br />PROS: Despite all mentioned above, I still find this method far easier that cutting everything by hand, which I did for years before the board.<br />Initially I thought there was something wrong with the design because all my envelopes came out wrong. I watched a YouTube video and got the hang of it after making 3-4 envelopes and now it’s a breeze and the process is very fast.<br />My 3 star review is because the new color combination is hard to read for some. And another star dinged because this really needs to be on a larger board platform. Us crafters spend our $ like crazy on our hobby, so why not make a larger version for $10 more. I sure would buy it! Don’t take the reviews seriously that say it<br />doesn’t work. They just don’t have patience and the willingness to learn something new. Quitters never win :)",

This is not made for humans my size (or shorter) for use as a lap desk.<br /><br />The photos show items sitting on the desk on full tilt, such as the phone and the ipad, staying in place. They had to glue those down, or those are photoshopped images, because this is so slippery, that even on the lowest tilt my mouse and laptop fly all over the place. Using a wireless magic mouse, so my mouse on the screen goes all over. This is also way way too tall to use as a lapdesk - unless you like carpel tunnel and shoulder/arm pain, it's the complete opposite of ergonomic. I didn't expect it would be, but I also didn't expect it to be so bad. I thought because of those photos, it would be possible to actually sit on the couch. I have deep seating, so figured it would be fine - it's not. Even with deep seats, the tips of the legs don't sit on the couch at all - about 4 inches stick out - and it's so high up, tilt doesn't help. You do NOT want to keep your arms up so high when working, and with this on the lowest height, my arms were raised up very high, maybe 11 inches higher than they should be for proper posture. Use at your own risk!!<br /><br />I think this would be useful for kids to color or have a snack while sitting on the floor - this is NOT for professionals using it to work on, and I wouldn't even be able to use this for a few minutes on a laptop for any reason.

Sometime that makes the labels too long.  I have an older, less expensive PT-80 that allows me to have nice, short margins.  I have seen some of the work-arounds, but none of them should be necessary.  If I want smaller margins on at least one side, I need to also have a pair of scissors handy and a broom for all those little extra pieces cut from the left of the two dots [the manual cut line for a centered label].  Worse, with all the good reviews, I expected to love the PT-210 and bought a two pack of tape.  I wasted all the sample tape just trying to get my labels to come out centered, with smaller side margins, and not needing to use scissors.  I guess this PT-210 and labels go on Craigslist.  My next label maker certainly will not be a Brother, nor will any other product.

            "question": "title: Outstanding printer, great value\ntext: I had a Canon BubbleJet BJC-4200 long ago, and after that printer I was very hesitant to even consider another Canon printer. When my most recent printer died, an HP DeskJet 970cse, I needed to find a good printer that could print duplex and produce quality output. After reading many, many reviews I decided to give Canon another chance. I am very glad that I did so.<br /><br />The Pixma iP4500 arrived in a huge box, and as it turns out it needed the space. This is a larger printer than I expected, and as a result I had to rearrange my desk to find room for it. That's a small oversight on my part. The printer itself is an unassuming-looking box of a machine, though it resembles more of a printer when the paper trays are populated.<br /><br />Setup was easy and straightforward, though I do recommend using the \"getting started\" insert before setting everything up. Though setting everything up is relatively self-explanatory, it is helpful to see the illustration of what to do in order before making the leap. Overall, setup took maybe 20-30 minutes once the parts were all out of the box and everything was set up.<br /><br />Once configured, installing the drivers is simple. Drop in the CD, follow the prompts, and turn on the printer at the right time. No fuss.<br /><br />Once set up and powered on, the printer is ready to go to work. I print a majority of my things in duplex mode so I tweaked the driver configuration to make it the default, after which the setting is more or less invisible. Everything in the driver configuration is very easy to find, straightforward, and simple.<br /><br />There are two ways to feed paper into the iP4500. There is a top-loader which is the default paper source and there is a front-loading paper tray (\"cassette\" according to Canon's documentation). Heavier papers such as card stock should be loaded from the top-loader.<br /><br />So, how does this printer perform? I'll break it down into two parts, speed and quality.<br /><br />Speed - this is a relatively fast printer! Feeding it a print job that conists of a two-sided black and white print this printer can churn out the pages, including the dry time for the front page, in about 20 seconds. Granted, this is my experience and your mileage may vary but it's a good starting point from which to base your evaluation of the speed. My previous printer would take at least a minute to print the very same documents, and it still couldn't keep up when in draft mode. For photo printing it churns out a full-page 8.5\"x11\" borderless photo in roughly 45 seconds.<br /><br />Quality - what good is speed without quality? This printer backs it up. The text and basic image quality is acceptable, though it could be a touch better. This is not noticeable in day-to-day print jobs. On photo printing, though, this printer is an absolute showstopper. The photos it prints, on photo paper, are better than most magazine prints and could easily be used for photo studio gallery shots.<br /><br />It would be nice if the printer actually had a USB cable in the box, but this is a small thing.<br /><br />Overall, this is a high-quiality, high-performance printer that is sure to please even the staunchest of critics. It is fast, creates beautiful output, and is very easy to set up.",

            "question": "title: Does everything I need; very heavy, but not a large footprint; fast; quiet\ntext: I am giving this 5-stars with some reservations.  First of, the cons.  The printer is very heavy and I had a hard time getting it out of the box; almost pulled a muscle.  Also had a hard time lifting it up on the table where it will sit.  I am 70 and I can just barely handle 40 pounds of weight; this weighs in at approximately 50 pounds.  If you can't handle 50 pounds and don't have help to lift and place it, don't get this printer.  The other concern I have is how long the toner cartridges might last and I have seen some say they have had problems with the printer reporting toner out before it is, but apparently there are ways to get full use of the cartridges before they are truly out, so it may not be a big deal.  When toner does run out, you'll end up spending about $70 a cartridge, so a replacement of all 4 (3 color and 1 black) will cost you between $200 and $300 depending on where you get the cartridges from.  What I recommend is that if you don't do a lot of color printing, just by a monochrome laser printer and supplement it with a cheap color ink jet.  Of course you have to consider whether or not you have room for two printers and also the cost of ink jet cartridges, which are not cheap either.  Now lets cover the good stuff and why I rated this 5-stars.  The printer is very fast and quiet.  It shoots out black & white pages very rapidly.  Of course color pages take a little longer, which you would expect, but are still reasonably fast.  Color print quality doesn't seem quite as good as some printers from other top printer manufacturers (such as EPSON and Canon), but it is adequate if your color printing requirements are not too precise.  Another thing I really like about Brother printers is that they include a FAX function.  Fax is a feature not as much needed these days, but there are times when it is needed and convenient.  Try to find a non-Brother printer with fax capability; I doubt you will.  The software install went easily and it wasn't too difficult to set up for wireless use.  You can use either USB or wireless.  The software is easy to use, but I did have difficulty trying to configure the printer to scan from the printer panel instead of the computer.  The scanning software on the computer is easy to use and it is easy to figure out how to scan letter or legal (or other sizes) and also not difficult to print on legal size.  For legal printing you do have to open a door on the front and feed the sheets in.  There is no paper tray for legal size, so this is not the ideal printer for printing lots of legal sized pages.  My older monochrome Brother laser could also handle legal scans and printing, but very complicated and difficult to set up.  It is fairly easy with this printer.  Overall, so far, I find this printer to be a big improvement over previous laser printers I have owned.  If I run into any problems later, I will update this review.  Note: I did not try the duplex scan, which seems like a good feature to have.",

We got reviewer cartridges a while ago and finally gave up on waiting for the HP one to run out.  We put in the new cartridge and did not get any errors or have any issues seating the cartridge.

If one or both dogs are with said person, the situation is even worse because even a quiet opening of the door can get the dogs barking and wake them up in the process. To help resolve this problem, I got a set of these Door Hangers, from CROWATTS.<br /><br />There are several varieties of from which to select with this brand. I went with the one that was most practical for me: Do Not Disturb/Please Knock. I got the ones with the blue color and dessert, since they have a tropical look which fits the theme of our house. At first glance, it looks like a cocktail and pool in the background but closer examination proves otherwise.<br /><br />What stands out most with these door hangers is their construction. You get a set of four and they are heavy- duty, thicker than most, with a vinyl- like feel. They won’t tear and are waterproof. You just slip them on a doorknob or door handle and you’re all set. There is a slit in the opening, too, to make it possible to fit them on most any door handle, but a doorknob seems to be where they fit best.<br /><br />With the Do Not Disturb clearly on display, we can cut back on accidental room entries and the irritation of being woken up too soon from a good nap or deep sleep. These door hangers have more practical use than I first thought and I predict they will continue to make a difference for many months to come. I’m most impressed with the construction and this fact alone earns this product a solid recommendation.",

So....here are my thoughts re the FEATHERS one.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />PRICE - usually 8.99, just got this on sale here for 6.99 so a plus, but DEFINITELY worth the 8.99!<br /><br />LOOK - I LOVE the subdued, but slightly glossy look!  No, it's not a BRIGHT design, but I love the look and the slight glisten to it.<br /><br />QUALITY - I was already used to this style having the Celestial which is like this, just different color and tab color, for years.  LOVE the quality.  Wonderful, sturdy hardback cover, page thickness is FINE for me and LOVE the tabs.<br /><br />SIZE - GREAT size to drop in your bag.  I have a LARGE Peter Pauper one to keep on my desk at home.<br />This small one gives me plenty of room for the info I need, like ems or phone numbers.  The larger one is great to add things like birthdays, addresses with PLENTY of room left over.<br /><br />LAYS FLAT - I like it can lay flat if I am looking up something and don't want to hold it in my hands.<br /><br />NICE BINDING -  I have NEVER had a problem with the binding in the numerous times I have gotten a Peter Pauper Address book.<br /><br />ELASTIC BAND! -  THIS is so great because if I want to take with me, the elastic band keeps it closed up and nothing catches on pages so they can be smooshed.<br /><br />OH AND if you need a BIGGER one, I got a LARGE one of the Peter Pauper's for my elderly mother and SHE LOVES IT!!<br /><br />CONS: NONE",

I spilled hot tea on it one night, quickly cleaned it up over a minute, yet didnt realize some tea prob got through the cracks in the panels of wood and the next night realized the wood had expanded/warped upwards so much in those areas.<br />I bought this to protect against future tea spills. and it looks like it will do the job.<br />One side is very clear (but feels stickier, so I assume this should be the bottom), and one side is more patterned/blurry (feels very plasticy so easier to slide things like cups, etc on your desk, so i assume this should be the top).<br />The reclaimed wood pattern is a tiny bit muffled/blurred but still looks great (the muffled side's pattern is kinda nice too since you don't have to worry about keeping it scratch-free/spotless). Note: there was a small 'streak' on the clear side of the desk like a few other reviewers mentioned. Didnt bother me since the clear side is going to be hidden under the muffled side if you choose to make the muffled side the top.<br />I wonder if its always meant to be placed that way.<br /><br />Quick tip for a tea spilling incident like mine: I was able to flatten the raised/warped portions of the panels of wood where the tea spilled by placing ten 10 lb weights on top of it in varying locations of the panels over 4 days and finally got the desk where its mostly flat/even across the surface again. (so basically 100lbs total focused on one area, just need a few sheets of paper placed under the weights so the weights don't dent the wood at the hard edges of the weights).",

You then have guided math questions and worksheets- one worksheet is recommended, one is on level but branching out a bit, and one worksheet is enrichment. All answers are in the back of the workbook.<br />As a homeschooler, this could be used as enrichment. You could simply take the worksheets or hands on activities and use those to supplement curriculum you’re already using. You could also use the entire model as complete curriculum. The workshop model would work just fine for one kid just like it would for 20. It is going to be pretty teacher intensive and they aren’t going to be able to complete this as a curriculum completely independently. You would still need to give the mini-lessons. But some kids do better with having someone show them and walk through it with them. You can also fold the entire thing in with your current curriculum, using this to beef up a curriculum that has a few more holes.<br />This book covers:<br />Operations (PEMDAS) and Algebraic Thinking<br />Number Operations in Base Ten<br />Number and Operations of Fractions<br />Measurement and Data<br />Geometry<br />There are also a few extras in the back for games you could play for a number of different skills.",

It contains sections for most typical areas of cooking; Appetizers, First Course, Main Dishes, Deserts, etc. plus several unlabeled sections for the owner to personalize. In addition there are weight, measure and temperature conversion charts, produce and fruit harvest/ripeness charts, food information charts and sections for notes, event or party planning. The cover is cleverly embossed with kitchen utensils and includes an elastic strap to keep the journal securely closed. Also included are three handy attached bookmarks and an expandable pocket in the back which contains the two sheets of stickers (for personalization) that come with the journal.<br /><br />The pages for recording your recipes have limited space for writing, you'll need write carefully and small to fit most recipes on a page. The pages are not removable and pages cannot be added or moved around. The print in the book (charts, tables, etc.) is nearly microscopic. I found it very hard to read anything in the journal.

The entire set up is very straight forward and not complicated which was a huge relief.  Be warned the parts are very heavy for the average person.  I'm glad it came in three boxes via FedEx because there would have been no way to get it up a flight of stairs if the entire thing had been pre-assembled.  The instructions were only slightly confusing when the legs were to be attached to the bottom of the table itself but overall it becomes immediately obvious once parts are all set out.  The holes for the electronic interface are a bit small and are only starter holes so it helps to have a good sized screw driver to get them all the way in.  I believe the interface to the electronic panel could have been a little more modern for the money spent.  But overall I'm completely impressed.  I originally had questioned how study the desk would be with a large monitor attached via vesa mount on an arm, but no issues there either.  The desk does not move or sway at all which is always a question with rising desks.  There is no platform on which to set a tower which is the only thing I would suggest to add in the future.  The legs are not exactly a white, but an off color of a gray/white mix but it still looks very pretty and doesn't clash with other colors.",

Setting up the the printer on WiFi was a snap. It recognized the SSID right away and I just had to enter the password. Every computer and smart phone then recognized the printer wirelessly right away. We've tested by printing from two computers and one phone. Flawless!<br /><br />The scan function works great as does the document feeder, which is really helpful for scans as you do not have to take the time to place your document(s) directly on the platen, or remove it (them). The little LCD screen is really easy to use for scanning, which is quick and of good quality. The color touch screen is bright and the icons are easy to read and easy to use.<br /><br />The print and scan quality are excellent. I didn't need it to be top of the line quality, but it sure is close. The print is a little light, but other users have said that this makes the MFC870 easy on ink use.<br /><br />For under $100, this little multifunction is a super deal. It is by far the best ink-jet I've ever owned and the well-designed multifunction capabilities make it the most versatile too.<br /><br />The 100-count paper tray is I suppose a bit of a downside. But, if you only print 100 pages every couple of weeks like we do, it's hardly noticeable.<br /><br />This is the first Brother printer I've ever owned. Sure glad I got it. :)",

When saying “little” that translates to a perfect size! Note: it is smaller then 8x11 sheet of paper (standard size) but, big enough in size for a page to hold real content! Refer to the Goldilocks scale- not too big, not too small.. but, rather right in the sweet spot of a happy medium- it’s just right!!<br /><br />I love this slides perfectly into purse, backpack, or even the computer sleeve itself- being made smaller then, standard size notebook.. it eliminates the taking of extra space, especially if a purse is not that big. I was needing something to travel easy -I’m a list maker!! In full swing of corona quarantine and a mom of 4, theres just too many things i must keep track of- So, keeping a “mom Bible“ lets me scribble down any assignment info., due dates, Rx pick up reminders.. lists we may need to survive.. you get the idea! (yes! We can add info to phone but, I always start lists and then, never remember where I stored them on my dang device!!)<br /><br />This hardcover notebook is sturdy which also, not only helps keep pages/content safe.. but, provides a solid writing surface. I LOVE the ribbon page markers and connected band to keep book tightly closed- so, only thing missing was a small pocket. I solved this issue by placing an add-in adhesive pocket directly on the inside cover.<br />Ordered in royal blue and TBH, it’s bright enough to find when Ive set it down 100 different places!! No, pages aren't lined but, rather dot lined, which is nice to keep one from writing “uphill..” Yet, you can still use to create a sketch if desired.. As a first time user of a dotted line system, I REALY like it!  (waiting with kids, I kept them busy with just x1 page of the handy dandy notebook and pencil, to play connect 4 box game- Ha! surprise bonus!!)<br /><br />This is sleek and nice enough to become anyone’s journal or, appropriate business notebook- the uses are endless and so, are colors to choose from.. For those who want, they even offer blank or, fully lined pages. Truly, covers all the bases... you can’t go wrong with this!!<br />Would be awesome if a notebook was sold offering all three paper styles… Blank/dot/line!! That would be amazing-<br />Hope this info. Helps.. feel free to let me know!",

I ordered 3 because I am going back to college in my adult life.  I always hated the binding on \"normal\" notebooks hurting when I write. When you finish writing on the front and flip to the back of the paper, the binding is on the left again. So what do you do, not write on the back of the paper. If you flip the notebook upside down to keep the binding on the right, now the back of the paper is upside down. For me it will just have to work since I don't have to turn papers in. But if a student needs to actually turn in the paper, it's not ok. The idea is good. But not for me. If you are a lefty, look for a notebook with no binder.

I have always been an HP girl.  The colors were truer and the quality better.  Well, not anymore.  I have often printed something out on my HP 8710 only to have to print it out on my Canon for much better quality when doing reference photos for paintings or drawings.  I ran out of ink.  Let's see what happened.<br /><br />WHAT ARE THESE LIKE?<br />These come just like other ink cartridges-each in plastic with an orange guard on the ink opening to protect it.  It also comes with a foam wedge in the lever to keep it from breaking- nice touch.  The sets of these are a full set minus the photo blue, which I tend to reserve for only a few photos now and then.<br /><br />HOW DID THESE WORK?<br />I found myself having a problem with my large black cartridge- stripes and failure everywhere!  Then I opened up the cartridge from this set and it is BEAUTIFUL.  The black is even nicer than the original black that came with this set.  This is the 2nd color I have replaced from this set and I am thrilled at how nicely they work.<br /><br />PRINT QUALITY<br />I am impressed at how much nicer this printer and ink refills print my reference photos for art.  It is important to have a reasonably balanced color reference.  My HP just was not doing it for me and this printer with these cartridges have been wonderful.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Although this does not come with photo blue, the price for two sets of ink of each of the other colors is an excellent price.  The quality is great, no conflicts, I will buy these again for sure if the price stays as nice.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  I love my printer and am very happy to have these reasonable cartridges to use in it. HP is over priced and the quality just isn't like it used to be in my experience as far as color inkjets go.",

However, this journal is cleaner and the paper whiter. It is vintage-looking but not too dirty and worn that it offends my senses.<br /><br />As is typical of a leather-bound journal, the paper is not replaceable. Writing on the paper with pen or pencil works well.  A few pages have smudges on them and I did see some thread or lint between some pages. The underside of the leather is poorly dyed looking as if it is dirty and does appear to have fingerprints dyed in the back of the journal. I do not care for those fingerprints. The tie is just a string of leather and not set in a way that makes it intuitive to tie the book shut. The embossing on the outside is very attractive, however.<br /><br />There are five sections that are \"stitched\" into the book. Each section has a centerfold string.<br /><br />The six photos show the following in order:<br /><br />1 - The attractive stitching on the binding and the outer leather embossing.<br /><br />2 - The front of the journal.<br /><br />3 - The back of the journal.<br /><br />4 - The blotchy spots found on some pages pages.<br /><br />5 - The  front inside leather cover and blotchy dye work.<br /><br />6 - The back inside leather cover and blotchy dye work with fingerprint stains.<br /><br />In summary, they succeeded in making this look dirty vintage and handmade from scrap. The exterior embossing of a dragon design is super attractive and so is the binder stitching. The leather is cheap and the paper is sometimes blotchy with occasional pieces of lint. This is definitely better than the  [[ASIN:B07PZVN2WN tree journal]] I ordered from them. Since the intention here is to look vintage, I would say they succeeded. I would not expect to pay more than $18 - $20 for this in its current condition. It has \"found in the attic\" sort of vibe to it.",

            "question": "title: Excellent product, but seems a bit bulky and pricey.\ntext: Now, the title is coming from someone new to the world of binding machines.  My fiancee is a 4th-grade math teacher, so I thought this would be of great assistance to her.  I didn't know what to expect, and was a little dumbfounded when I first set it up, but then I realized just how easy it was.<br /><br />You can only put 20 sheets of paper at a time to punch the holes in, but it works flawlessly.  The actual binding mechanism left me a bit hesitant at first, as I thought it was too easy and there was something I was doing wrong.  Once the machine took over, however, my fears were tossed at sea.<br /><br />So why the one less star?  Perhaps it's just me, but it seems a bit heavy and pricey for just what it does.  Again, I'm no binding machine expert, and I'm sure the electronic version is far superior to the manual, but $275 is a bit much considering it only punches 20 pages at at time, and 26 pounds seems overwhelming, especially since it's electronic.<br /><br />The machine is going to stay in the house for years to come, or as long as someone stays a teacher, and has already served its purpose in the short time that we've had it.",

            "question": "title: Still Prefer The Epson LabelWorks But This Is A Decent Basic Label Maker\ntext: I never knew how much I could use labels until I got my first label maker.  I have used that for a LOT of different purposes and have found it useful.  My previous label maker experience is with a more luxurious model from Epson.  However, for quick little labels that I want to use on items on the go, I thought it would be handy to have a smaller sized label maker to take with me and use quickly for quick labels that I am not quite as concerned about perfection on.  This label maker seems like a valid choice.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LABEL MAKER LIKE?<br />Measuring 5 1/2 inches by 4 inches, this label maker is very portable.  It has a clear LED screen that is just black and gray.  It does not have back lighting to use in very dark areas, so be aware of that.  There is a standard key board on this which makes it not have a huge learning curve for typing.  The label maker only comes with one small starter roll of labels which means you will have to buy more pretty soon after purchasing if you plan to make any significant amount of labels.<br /><br />The instruction fold out sheet is invaluable.  I would highly suggest that if you get this, you immediately print it out via copier- more on that later.<br />You can control the font, designs, size, width of label contents, length of the label, and even up to two lines of text.  The unit takes 4 AAA batteries which it does not come with.  You will want to have them handy before you attempt to use this.<br /><br />The back comes off easily to insert the batteries and the tape roll which is good.  You don't have to unscrew anything or really struggle with tight fitting plates that don't want to come off.  The keys are easy to press and are not too close together.  The printer slot for the labels to come out is at the back of the machine, along with the cutter tool.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS LABEL MAKER PERFORM?<br />I have to say that I am spoiled by my current label maker, but this one is a decent contender for the smaller label maker needs.  The instructions are mandatory for you to run this machine.  I will say that one feature I like is that if you want to print out the different graphics that you can use on the label maker, you have the ability to do that.  Then you can stick that label on the bottom or side of the unit in case you misplace the instructions.<br /><br />I tried to make a variety of labels- from simple contents labels to more fancy labels with borders and design.  Both worked beautifully.  You can save a label or print multiples of the same label with this machine.  You can also preview the label before you print it.<br /><br />WHAT I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THIS MACHINE<br />There are only a few things I am not fond about with this machine.<br />1.  You can not preview the graphic with the label- it only shows as the listing A1, B2, J3, etc.<br />2. You can only print straight labels, not the type that wrap around cords.<br />3.  When printing deco labels with repeating designs, you have to have a resting period.  This overheats quickly.<br />4.  The labels are very flimsy and have a single back on them which can make them a bit tricky to peel apart<br /><br />FEATURES I LIKE<br />1.  You can print out the pictograph list on a label and stick to the machine for reference<br />2.  Instructions are clear and make this easy to use<br />3.  Keyboard is standard so no learning curve for typing text<br />4.  Labels stick well to anything I have put them on including glass, frosted glass, metal, plastic, and wood.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Although I really enjoy using my [[ASIN:B005J7Y6GS Epson LabelWorks LW-400 Label Maker]] much more than this label maker, I did find this useful for quick jobs.  It does what it says nicely, and although the labels are a bit flimsy, they do stick well.  I did like the feature of being able to print the pictographs on a label to put on the machine in case you can not find the instructions.  I did not like that it lacks some features such as back light, printing labels horizontally or vertically, or to wrap around cords like the Epson does.  I also didn't like the single backed tape vs the split back tape of the Epson.<br /><br />If I had to make a choice, I would still pick the [[ASIN:B005J7Y6GS Epson LabelWorks LW-400 Label Maker]] with the tape bundle.  I find the labels to be more sturdy and substantial.  However, this is a decent label maker and I still give it four stars.<br /><br />I will update as I use this over time to add any more insights or details that might be helpful in your buying decision.",

As I have to look at it all year, I want great pix and large enough daily spaces to write appointments.  I look at MANY calendars before deciding.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />FIRST, THE SIZE.  12 X 24 when opened.  I always check because this is about standard but I have not checked and been disappointed in the past with a too small calendar.<br /><br />SECOND, LOOKS GREAT on my kitchen wall.  LOVELY SERENE IMAGES AND the IMAGE takes up a little more than half of the calendar.  You know how usually you unfold a calendar and the image is on the top half and calendar/days are on the bottom?  WELL, in this one the IMAGE extends a bit into the bottom half making for a stunning large image, yet there is still PLENTY of room to write in the daily boxes.<br /><br />THIRD - PAPER QUALITY!  VERY IMPRESSED.  I have had some much more expensive calendars with low quality, flimsy paper.  This has a nice substantial paper, glossy and clear images.  it's not stiff, like light cardboard heavy, but not like tissue paper either.<br /><br />FOURTH - the daily boxes are an OPEN grid which means if you need to, you can extend a tad outside the box.<br /><br />FIFTH - THE PRICE!  IF you have checked out nice wall calendars, NOT UNCOMMON for them to be between about 12-15 BUCKS.

I can honestly say these pens are great to draw with! The quality of the ink seems very close to that of sakura, I would say the black is a deeper black with these pens, as opposed to sakura micron. They also have lasted me longer then any other doodle pen I've used in the past.  The pen case and body are nearly identical to sakura, and it seems the nib sizes printed on the cap don't wear off as easily as sakuras. They write very bold lines with very minimal if any, feathering or spreading. The sizes seem to be accurate, the cap has a nice click when u cap it off, insuring u will not leave one partially open and it dry out. The ink is very quick drying and doesnt smear on paper. They don't seem to bleed through very easily to the reverse side of ur paper, as I showed in my pictures, where I traced back over my lines 1-5 times and the bleed through has little to no difference between one line and 5 times trace over.  . These pens are a awesome deal for the price, coming from a true sakura pen junkie!!! With the smooth crispy lines , no skipping, or drag to them, no leaking tips, no blurred or smeared lines, dried extremely fast, many sizes in one package, makes these pens a great buy for all artists, especially if your looking for a deep black pen with no weird bluish shine to it that seem to last a long time- and have stayed consistent in color after many many uses. Try them they are my fav off brand ive tried so far, I usually say eh they are okay and always go back to sakura. But I am adding this brand to my favorites!! If u love cool pens u got a check out sakura gelly rolls, I love them all but some awesome ones are: glaze, moonlight, souffle, stardust(sparkly), silver shadow. Absolutely best pens for adding bold colors and textures to ur art or scrapbooks! Enjoy!",

You have no idea how annoyed I have been with the different packaging that push pins come in.  They always open up and fall out and drive me up the wall.  These, however, come in a SCREW TOP plastic round container.  That was a big plus right there.<br /><br />HOW DO THEY PERFORM?<br />These are typical push pins.  They come in various colors, have a cheap plastic head on them (Well, in terms of hammering anyway) and they have a pretty sharp edge on them to use on bulletin boards, but also other uses.<br /><br />USES THAT I HAVE FOR THESE<br />When we go to coffee shops and other businesses in our area, there are usually bulletin boards for cards to be put up for local businesses.  Since I have some businesses in our family, I always carry a little baggie with a few push pins and business cards in them to put up on the boards.  You can not believe how handy that comes in.<br /><br />-bulletin boards at home<br />-curtain tie backs<br />-put on boards for lightweight hanging spots for organizing lightweight things with light strap handles<br />-cat toys on the tower (pound with hammer into the wood lightly and it holds for a month or two)<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />A great container with a screw on cap had me impressed with these, but all in all, I am glad to have them for the variety of uses that I use them for and more that I am sure I will come up with.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.

I selected these notebooks with that thought in mind, that she would use these for keeping up with stuff in the house. These have proven to be decent notebooks so far.<br /><br />Instead of a thin cardstock-type of cover, these have a poly cover that will not easily rip or tear easily, and that has a couple of benefits. First, it will provide longer protection for the pages in the notebook. Second, the color makes identifying the notebook easy (distinct from others in the pack due to color) without concern that the cover will go away.<br /><br />The pages are perforated and make tearing out sheets easier. It's not difficult at all to get straight, clean edges on pages that are removed. I personally like that the pages are college ruled, so there is better use of room for writing more.<br /><br />These are decent spiral notebooks and they will get used up over time in my house.

Ink is less expensive than HP, and there is no shortage of competitive manufacturers of ink which are 60% less than OEM, yet work just as well. I'm an experienced network tech, so install for me was easy. I would think it might be a little challenging for someone less technically inclined, but the manual is fairly comprehensive. I have had very good past experiences with Brother products, and expect the same from this device.",

The light itself is of very good quality and is VERY bright. I love that it is so surprisingly lightweight as well. It really doesn't take much to hang it and even a small backdrop clamp can hold it up with ease. The included fob works well and it is a nice bonus to be included with this sign. It can be used to turn the light on and off as well run it through a few different lighting effects. If I were to complain about anything it would be the fact that the included power cord is very short. You will most likely need an extension cord to hang it where you want. This really isn't a con per-say as most businesses who will buy this, will most likely have a plug fairly close to where this sign might hang. For my purposes however, I will need the extension cord no matter what. Overall, I am very pleased with this LED sign and would like to add more to my expanding photography props.

A stapler is the best and easiest means for this task and one possible option is the Staplers Office Small One Touch Stapler.<br /><br />Compact in size, this stapler fits into small spaces so it’s easy to store. It uses standard staplers, so you don’t need to shop for anything special. It doesn’t hold as many staples as other, larger staples and that means it runs out more quickly and must be refilled more frequently.<br /><br />The best feature of this stapler is that it requires less effort to use. You don’t need to push down hard with your hand- a softer touch is all it takes. Don’t get the wrong idea- it still requires pushing, just not as much effort as conventional staplers. I’ve used electronic staplers that truly are touch- activated, but this one isn’t quite like that. You still need to push.<br /><br />Due to its small size, this stapler is best suited for young people. I like that it can hold up to 25 sheets of paper but the small size makes its use limited overall. I still think it has some good points to offer, but I can’t give it more than an average rating for the reasons stated above.",

The simple act of pushing a chair back to stand up and pulling it forward to sit down can absolutely destroy your floors. It doesn't happen overnight, but you'll see considerable wear and tear after a few months.<br /><br />These days, my office is in a room with a wood floor. I restored the wood floor over a period of a few weeks. This entailed getting on my hands and knees and scraping, sanding, and painting the floor. I'm not inclined to lose all that hard work to scrapes from an office chair.<br /><br />My main concern was that this item would have a curve to it when I pulled it out of the box. That turned out not to be the case as you can see in the above photo. The moment it arrives, you can uncoil it and have it lie flat. Be a little careful when you unwrap the item, it springs open and if you're cutting the plastic wrap with a knife it could be dislodged from your hand.<br /><br />The material is durable and doesn't make noise when you pull your chair across it. One side is smooth and the other side has a texture. The size is as advertised. This is a good choice for a home or office.",

Instead, it made sitting on the sofa very uncomfortable and I could feel every indentation.  I put a bath towel over it and that didn’t help.<br /><br />I then placed it on my Aeron look alike chair.  It is perfect for that purpose.  It provides excellent comfort.<br /><br />The directions mention placing the cushion with one side up and the other side down.  I couldn’t tell the difference between the two sides.  You will be sitting directly on the gel coils.  It is not encased in a cotton or nylon cover. That may be a problem if you are wearing shorts while using it. Placing a towel over it should solve that problem.<br /><br />I’m not sure why it didn’t work on my sofa.  The cushion is made for hard chair seating, and using it on a sofa changes the body contact area. Possibly, it needs a hard chair like surface to spring back firmly. The sofa, although firm, just had too much give.<br /><br />It is a good cushion and I can recommend it.",

If you are working with markers or pens that saturate the paper when you write, these will allow bleed-through. The card stock used is not the best quality and is not thick or sturdy so if you need cards that have some heft or are sturdy, these will definitely disappoint. For our purposes, these are just fine, but if you're thinking flash cards or small handwritten signs, these are not the best choice.<br /><br />These are ok. For my particular case these work just fine, but many others will find them to be just too thin and flimsy for a lot of uses.",

I wish Lamy and Amazon made the nibs available for a better price, but as it was I could get the whole pen for just a little more than the nib and shipping.  Amazon was not and still is not today selling the nibs, so Prime or Super Saver shipping isn't available.<br /><br />Rather than changing the nib on my Safari, which I could just push off with my fingernail, I just swapped the barrel and cap.  The long barrel on the Joy is impractical, but I do prefer the smooth black section and feed to the Safari's coarse textured grey one.  I don't care for the red clip on the Joy's cap, but again, I bought it for the nib.<br /><br />The nib is decent, I suppose for the price.  The 1.1 italic nib gives me exactly what I was looking for whereas the fine nib on the Safari was a big disappointment.  The 1.1 nib is a bit scratchy, but it writes beautifully.  I think the tines may be a bit too tight as no light passes between them, and I can barely force a piece of fine paper between them.<br /><br />Together, the Joy and Safari are decent pens and they've helped me figure out what I care for in a pen without costing me a fortune.  I continue to use the Safari barrel and cap with the Joy's section, feed, and nib, along with a converter and Noodler's black ink for every day carry.  I don't think I'll ever become a collector or desire to own luxury pens.  I'll admire them, but I only want a pen for EDC that's like the one I have.  It could be better if the nibs were smoother, and the different nibs had better availability.",

It sort of worked!<br />I had all the drawers with something in them - I tried a variety of things.<br />Fabric ended up being way too heavy, even though that is what I hoped to use it for.<br /><br />The thing is - this is a fairly wide drawer to pull out. When there is much of any weight<br />in them, they don't want to pull out! Mine did not seem to be warped, yet that is how it<br />acted. The drawers became almost impossible to pull out if there was actually stuff in them.<br />I ended up using it to hold bubble wrap, which was a real waste of the \"real estate\" this thing<br />takes up. It worked okay for bubble wrap, but I was needing more storage for other things.<br /><br />So, it is back to the drawing board for Sterlite on this design - it's too wide for the thin<br />plastic that is used for this one. If they'd thicken it up a bit on the drawers, it would be<br />really good. My little 12\" wide Sterlite 3-drawer bin on rollers has thicker drawers than<br />this big one does!<br /><br />So, I'd have to advise taking a \"pass\" on this one until they beef up the plastic drawers.<br />Otherwise, if you only have really lightweight things, like hosiery, scarfs, socks, etc, it<br />MIGHT work for you, but I wouldn't count on it.",

I did find that I had to adjust the print settings below what was recommended in the instructions.  I had a very color intense image so in photoshop I used two adjustment layers,  Hue/Saturation set at 50% lightness setting only,  Brightness/Contrast set at 75/70.  I'm not a photoshop expert but these worked for me.<br />After shrinking the image was crisp without much skewing. It has a matte look and feel.  I always seal my projects as they are not waterproof otherwise.",

They really did not feel durable. If you are giving them to kids, it could be an issue. Once I got them together I could push them.

I'm doing birds right now. There is no comparrison to the other kits of colored pencils I have. I originally got smaller prisms sets - the 12 color, then the 36 and the skin tone, but they didn't have a grey in them and only a few blues. This set is everything and I don't want to be without it again. I'l have to keep ordering it as my pencils get used down. Thank you Amazon for the quick delivery. I am very happy with this. I've sharpened over 100 of this 150 set and no breakage. It is August in the Pacific Northwest and wax pencils do much better sharpening in warmer areas because the was melts together. If you have an issue sharpening, do not wear your pencil down. Stop immediately and place the pencils in warm water for at least 15 mins so the wax inside melts together  as sometimes it doesn't stay all together when they're made. I learned this on Prismas site. Never put them in the microswave, it will melt the wax too much. I didn't have to do any of this with my big set. It's perfect.",

            "question": "title: One Of The Most Frustrating Experiences Yet (I WANT This To Work)\ntext: EDIT- I KNEW as soon as I wrote this review, I would find a work around.  It is not thrilling, but it works.  I had to do some extensive research to find anything with N41 in the title that fits the HPRT printer.  I ended up finding another driver dated from 2018 in Chinese which works.  The caveat is that this driver only has millimeters and not inches at all.<br /><br />BUT, I did finally find a driver that would work.  I forgot to add in my original review that the flash drive that came with this had a malfunctioning video which only played music on any player I tried it on.  I also wanted to say that all links in the manuals led to things that did not work.<br /><br />I am putting my review to 2 stars because honestly, unless you do what I did to get this thing to work, if you end up with a malfunctioning set of driver links, flash drive videos, etc, I just don't think that is acceptable for a unit of this price.<br />-----------------<br />ORIGINAL REVIEW<br /><br />I have been around tech for quite some time.  I am not a novice.  I no longer have the time to troubleshoot for days on end to make equipment work.  I was hoping for a better label experience than I had with another printer.  This one, unfortunately so far, has been WORSE.<br /><br />HOW THIS COMES<br />This comes in a box very well cushioned.  It is wrapped in plastic so if your box arrives soggy like ours did, you will have a chance of this being protected.<br /><br />INSTRUCTIONS<br />There is a flash drive included in this with instruction manual (that you have to print if you hate reading on devices), sample print out, and driver installation instructions.<br /><br />CORD<br />The cord with this is RIDICULOUSLY SHORT.  If you are going to use this at a desk that does not have an outlet really close to where you want to put this, get ready to get a suitable extension cord or power strip.  That frustrated me right off the bat.<br /><br />INSTALLATION OF DRIVER<br />I would love to tell you that this installed easily and I was on my way to try this printer.  Instead what I got was two hours of intense frustration that made me want to throw this away.  I am THAT frustrated.<br /><br />No matter what I tried to do, I could not get this driver to install.  I tried EVERYTHING I knew how, other than intense tech level investigation.  Most of you buying this would not be doing that.  I am reviewing this with you in mind.<br /><br />WHAT HAPPENED?<br />I got the software to unload in my system.  It says that the device is installed.  I have it show up as unknown.  I go in by hand to install the driver (which was unpacked already) and it still shows up as not installed.  I have tried automatic via windows, automatic via the printer company web site, and manual installation of the driver.<br /><br />PRINTING<br />I can not get this to work.  I would love to get it to work.  I would love to have a label printer I can use.  This, however, is not installing and I can not get it to install.  My parameters are Windows 10 down to 7 (tested on two devices) which are both included in the compatibility list.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />If I am able to get this to install and work, I will update this review.  I was putting off reviewing this for a while planning to be the hero and have the fix to get this to work if you are having issues like I have.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />ONE STAR.  I can not give any more for a device that will not install so I can not go any farther with it.  This device comes with the promise in the listing that it will be simple and easy to set up and use.  My experience has been the opposite.<br /><br />UPDATES<br />I will update if I finally am able to work with this and get it to install correctly.  I feel that I have done everything that the average person would do to install this, so until I have a work around, I will leave this as it is for now.",
