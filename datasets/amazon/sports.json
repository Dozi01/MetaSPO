It's insanely fast to pop up this tent! I thought that would mean it is insanely hard to put it away as some other pop-up-style tents seem to be. But surprisingly it wasn't hard to all to put away once you understand how it unbuckles. At first I think I almost broke it trying to figure it out- You don't force it to bend, you have to pull up on the joint to unlock it otherwise it might snap and break. The instructions weren't clear on that, but once you get it, honestly, it's pretty fast and simple. I'm impressed.<br />It's also pretty roomy inside. We all know when a tent says \"3-4 Person\" they mean really more like 2, but more can squeeze like sardines if they are skinny. Well, I had 3 kids stay in here, age 4 to 11, and they did NOT feel cramped (see picture- the sides weren't even spread out all the way since it was indoors and a couch was in the way). I climbed in to hang out with them for a bit, and I can honestly say one roughly 190lb dad and 3 kids fit inside and it didn't seem too crazy in there. It's also pretty tall for a small tent- my kids can stand inside easily and not hit the ceiling.<br />Would easily recommend!",

            "question": "title: Purchased by Dad but Reviewed by Mom & Son!\ntext: My son decided to wrestle this year for his middle school. I was surprised! In the past he has leaned towards other non-contact sports. He has played baseball competitively (on various travel teams) since he was 5. He even tried his hand at rec football (yeah I was surprised by that one too) but he announced that he didn't think he would be pursuing football at his middle school. So when he came home and announced that he was \"trying out for wrestling\" I was baffled, but decided not to worry UNTIL he made the team. So when he came home and said that he MADE the 8th grade wresting team, I immediately had visions of people with \"cauliflower ear and other wrestling injuries\". So the only way I was going to feel better about his decision (after all I am supportive) was to make sure that he has the best possible headgear (safety equipment) available. His father and I read some reviews and searched on-line for various opinions/options, and finally decided that this Cliff Keen F5 Tornado Headgear seemed like the perfect place to start. It appeared to be reliable, or as reliable as something protecting your head can be while playing a contact sport. So although I knew that I would still worry, what could I do besides have faith that a product (recommended by some who have been involved in the sport for a lot longer than I), would do what it is suppose to do, protect my 13-year-old son during his matches?<br /><br />I must say after observing several middle school wrestlers grapple and grab at each other (some with no headgear at all), I decided that the $40 investment was well worth it. I have only seen my son's headgear slip once, and that was because the kid he was wrestling grabbed on to it for extended amounts of time. And while it did slip some, it remained firmly on his chin, with only the top belt slipping onto his forehead. But once he was able to push away for his opponent, he was able to cooly slip the top strap back in place (quickly and easily). Otherwise, no matter the hold or the force used, the Cliff Keen F5 Tornado Headgear appears to stay in place.<br /><br />What I like about them.... Well, first of all, his ears are extremely protected! I don't really worry since I have never seen it come off completely during a match (but remember I have seen it slip once onto his forehead). All in all, I think those are some very good odds, especially since I see a lot of kids lose their headgear or not wear any at all (which I still don't understand). Second, the Tornados are somewhat stylish (hey I am a Mom but I am also clearly a girl). I was able to order these in all black which coordinates with his wrestling singlet (I affectionately call it an onesie) and shoes. And finally, I also like the fact that this headgear is easy to clean. I simply put a small pack of Clorox wipes (in his bag) and told him to wipe them off following their morning and afternoon conditioning. And if he is worried that he used too much, I told him to wipe them off again with a slightly damp cloth and let them dry. So far there has been NO discoloration or ANY SMELL! They have held up pretty well to be used daily.<br /><br />What my son likes about this headgear.....after all he is really the consumer. He says that they are light weight, and extremely comfortable. He said that there is a lot of room for his ears, which are surrounded by soft padding/material, and that he can barely tell that the chin strap is on. But most importantly he feels that his ears are safe. All in all, I think that we got our money's worth. While they may not have been the cheapest out there or the most expensive, they definitely have the features that I think are essential for any young wrestler. My son's health is definitely worth the extra money! Afterall, he is my biggest investment.  I wholeheartedly give this product a 5.",

In doing my research for a worthy substitute, I was really attracted to this water bottle.  I loved the company's sustainable values and how well-made their product seemed.<br /><br />When I received the water bottle, I was surprised how lightweight on it is on its own; of course, it gets heavy when you fill it with 40 oz of water, which I wish that I had the foresight to realize before I made this purchase.  It is so heavy and wide that I need to use two hands to pick up and drink out of when it is full.  The other noticeable thing about the bottle is its beautiful color.  I bought it in aqua and it is so eye-catching that I got two compliments on it in my small office during its first day of use.<br /><br />I did not like the style of the cap which the water bottle came with, so after doing research, I purchased another brand's water bottle cap which was HydroFlask-compatible, which I also thought should be compatible with this one.  Unfortunately, it is not.  The cap screws on, but it leaks.  Of course, this is not the fault of the brand or the water bottle, but it was disappointing to me, and if you are considering buying the bottle and swapping out the cap, this might be worth taking note of.<br /><br />When I first bought this water bottle, I intended to use it all the time to replace my current water bottle.  However, due to its hefty size and weight, I have decided to keep this bottle strictly at the office, as it is even too heavy and unwieldy to bring back and forth to my car, gym, and/or home.  I drive a little sedan and it does not fit in my cup holders.  I might be bringing it to the gym on my heavy cardio evenings, but it definitely staying in the office for pilates and barre.  And it is definitely useful to have around for camping or hiking!<br /><br />Overall great water bottle and very pleased with the product; unsure how practical it is for daily hydration use when commuting (unless you commute with a backpack).",

It solved a problem that had defeated everything I tried.  It quickly removed all the surface rust and gunk from a metal commode frame that had developed rust spots where water splattered and corroded the chrome tubing.  Not even Windex would clean that chrome frame; but this Xtreme Clean worked in seconds!  Now the chrome looks shiny and new where it's not already corroded, and the entire metal frame surface is clean.<br /><br />Xtreme Clean comes in a plastic bottle with a spray top (Off, Spray, Stream).  You don't want to get it in your eyes, and you should wash it off if you get it on your hands, but in general it seems to be safe and non-toxic.  Most household cleaners that are as effective as Xtreme Clean one have a multi-page label with lots of scary use and storage warnings.<br /><br />This is a product that I'll be reordering often, because it does an excellent job on that previously-impossible-to-clean commode frame.

We camped a lot when I was a child and setting up the tent always involved a lot of cussing on someone's part. This wasn't too different an experience in some ways.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Fairly easy to set up the first time out of the box. I did it by myself.<br />Lightweight enough for a woman to carry<br />Large floor space and tall enough for a 6' 2&#34; man to stand up in.<br />Lots of vents and windows<br />Nice rainfly<br /><br />Cons:<br />Impossible directions. You don't need them too much to get set up, but you need some guidance to get the tent down and back in the bag. It took 3 tries to finally get it in there<br />The center beam on the top that keeps the tent stretched out, did not lock in place for us. I don't know if this is a defect or just poor design<br />Because of the lightweight nature of this, the floor and walls are very thin material. The floor reminds me of one of those really cheap plastic tarps that you can get.<br />The metal stakes that are used to hold in the feet of the poles bend very easily if you hit a rock or an obstacle.<br />Not very secure when set up. I think this would need some serious tent stakes to hold it down in any kind of wind. It was windy here today and I'm not sure this would have stayed together too long.<br />The zippers are not going to take much use, in fact the whole thing might be good for one season of regular camping and use/abuse.<br /><br />All in all, I was hoping for better. At least something that kids visiting us could use. Maybe with a little tweaking we can get it stable.",

            "question": "title: Peaceful Settings\ntext: Your first observation might be similar to mine. The outdoor setting is calming and just gorgeous. The colors in this video are beautiful and the river creates a calm, quiet and peaceful setting for your workout.<br /><br />I enjoyed the workout, but didn't realize how many muscles you needed to perch yourself atop a balance ball. You start off just rolling over the ball and then progress to some pretty tough balancing acts. There are some stretches which will stretch out your spine in new ways. I realized I'm not as flexible as I thought I was.<br /><br />I'd advise watching this video at least once before proceeding because it sometimes difficult to follow the workout while attempting to focus on not hurtling towards the floor if you are not totally focused on what you are doing.<br /><br />The kit includes:<br /><br />Medium inflatable exercise ball (green, 26\"/65cm)<br /><br />Full-length workout video (35 minutes)<br /><br />Air pump<br /><br />The Air pump is \"ok,\" but I found that an electric pump was much more efficient. If you use the air pump, you might want to do that \"workout\" the day before. The instruction scare you into worrying about inflating the ball too much, but never fear, with that pump, it might be impossible.<br /><br />The medium exercise ball is \"ok\" but had I realized there was a larger balance ball, I'd have ordered the larger one since I'm taller. If you are 5' 9\" and above, I'd say go for the blue balance ball (large size). I think weight also counts. If you are above your recommended weight (ideal weight and all that), then you might want a larger size.<br /><br />On the side of the box it says:<br /><br />Small Purple Balance Ball - Height 5' 0\" to 5' 5\" - Ball Size 22\"/55cm<br /><br />Medium Green Balance Ball - Height 5' 6 to 5' 11\" - Ball Size 26\"/65cm<br /><br />Large Blue Balance Ball - Height 6' 0\" to 6' 3\" - Ball Size 30\"/75cm<br /><br />The exercise video is combination of shorter segments from three balance ball workouts. You really have to concentrate on making smooth and steady movements.<br /><br />The way I found this workout to be most effective was to place the ball on top of a yoga mat. This prevents slippage of the ball on a carpet and also prevents you from getting injured because the yoga mat provides an additional level of protection from your hands and feet slipping on a carpet.<br /><br />You will be doing three workouts.<br /><br />Upper Body<br /><br />Abs<br /><br />Lower Body<br /><br />There are times when you are either sitting, leaning over the ball or on your back, balancing and stretching out your spine. The hardest part of this workout is when you are on you back and you are rolling on top the ball. It is easier once you make full use of your powers of concentration.<br /><br />The video is a nice introduction, but is really only an introduction. While you can get a good beginner's workout, I'd imagine it is more effective to order the three additional videos they recommend. Karen Voight also has a DVD out called BLT (Butt, Legs & Tummy) on a ball.<br /><br />This workout will take you to new levels of concentration and mind-body awareness. It will work the upper body, lower body and abs. You will be strengthening, toning and conditioning smaller core muscles.<br /><br />The 45 minutes includes a 5-minute warm-up to learn proper positioning.<br /><br />If you enjoy this workout, look for:<br /><br />BalanceBall Fitness Upper Body Workout<br /><br />BalanceBall Fitness Abs Workout<br /><br />BalanceBall Fitness Lower Body Workout<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",

            "question": "title: Solid 60\" Umbrella\ntext: An umbrella is usually one of those things you don’t think about until you need it, and at that point it is often too late to go get one without getting soaking wet. I am in the habit of keeping one in the back seat of my car so I will always have one when I am out and about. The one I keep there has been great but it is nothing particularly special (excepting the color). I was anxious to see if this umbrella would be better for my needs. So far it has worked out well for me.<br /><br />This is a very large and sturdy umbrella, which is the kind I prefer (I am ok with the little compact ones in a pinch, when I am just trying to keep my head dry). It opens with the push of a button and it snaps open with a loud click, so there is no question it is completely open. Closing again requires two hands, one to hold the handle and the other to pull down the slider to snap it in place, and when it is closed properly it does so with a loud click – again, no question that it is closed properly.<br /><br />It appears to be very study when open. I have had it get caught in a strong gust and it did not invert on me, which is a very good thing. The handle is solid and is well insulated with a foam grip that is easy to  hang onto even when very wet.<br /><br />One of the features about this umbrella that is prominently placed in the description as well as on the packaging is that it is coated in Teflon. I will confess that I cannot see or feel it on the nylon, but water does bead up and roll off differently than with other umbrellas I have used. This may not seem like it’s all that important – until you are ready to shake it dry and close it. Most nylon umbrellas I have used do not shake dry so nicely, but this one is a little better about that than most.<br /><br />Finally, the umbrella itself comes in a nice sleeve that serves two purposes. First, it protects the umbrella when it is not in use which is a minor concern but is helpful in some situations like storage in a full closet. The other purpose it has is for carrying – it has a double cord in it so it can be slung over a shoulder, or work like a backpack when closed. This frees up your hands of other things when it is not raining.<br /><br />This is a nice, large and well-made umbrella. It is constructed to handle windier conditions and it repels water a bit better than most. It is a little more expensive than the typical umbrella, but it is worth it’s asking price and I am happy to recommend it.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

I'm an avid cross-country skier, and after a workout it's important to slip into a high quality jacket. This jacket feels like putting on a sleeping bag and it will have you toasty warm in no time. The label says it has a polyester lining, and I haven't seen any signs of down feathers poking out between the seams.<br /><br />The jacket has a shiny appearance and the shell feels almost slick to the touch. It is good at repelling water, so it won't get wet if you're out in the snow. I liked the lining fabric on the front pockets. There's nothing fuzzy that might get caught on a ring or keys, but your hands feel well insulated. There is also an inside pocket that is ideal for a cell phone or wallet. The hood is large enough to be useful, and covers your head even if you're wearing a hat. An elastic cinch cord extends from either end with a plastic cord lock on both sides.<br /><br />The zipper is really nice and never gets caught up on the inner lining. It is important to have a quality zipper on a quality jacket because nothing is worse than when your zipper jams up. This zipper has big teeth and smooth action. I also like the cuffs and waist material which are form fitting but not too tight. This is a very nice jacket for skiing, or just staying warm for city winter life.",

The entire set fit nicely, along with a hand held microphone, a few patch cables and spare batteries.<br /><br />The case ships with two 2-inch thick layers of egg crate style foam and a separate 1-inch layer of regular foam that can be cut out.

Assembled it, charged it up as instructed in about three hours, hit the throttle and nothing, didn't budge at all. Swagtron customer service said they've heard of Amazon shipping refurbished scooters as new lately, which I'm guessing happened to me because the \"new\" scooter has a few scratch marks and gouges down near the joint where the handlebars fold up.<br /><br />Also the rear disk brake is very stiff and you have to manually push the brake lever back into place or else it drags on the wheel, and the screw that fastens the brake lever to the handlebars was almost impossible to turn, I lost some skin on my fingers and stripped the screwhead getting it into place. Now I have to get it off again and pack the whole thing back up.<br /><br />Amazon customer service is shipping what they say will be a brand new scooter that works, and they're also sending UPS to pick up the old one for no charge. Hopefully this will get resolved but this is all a real disappointing pain in the neck.<br /><br />UPDATE: Got the replacement from Amazon in a few days as promised. It definitely seems new, since there's packaging and safety stickers that weren't included with the first one I got. No scratches either. The brake lever went on easily and works well. But best of all it actually works. Pick up the front wheel and hit the throttle and it maxes out at 17.9 MPH with no load. Haven't tried it outside yet because of weather but I have been driving around an indoor garage and it hits over 14 MPH no problem, which feels pretty fast.

I like the brightness of the latest generation LED flashlights even though it can be harsh as they can really light up and area so much better than an incandescent light or cheaper LED lights. This is an exceptionally bright flashlight that works very well and is easy to adjust.<br /><br />In the package is the flashlight itself, a rechargeable 18650 battery and a battery charger. Everything you need to get going and using this light is in the box and the battery is charged up already so when you open the box you're ready to go. Also included is a holder/adapter for AAA batteries so this flashlight can be used with 3 AAA batteries instead of so desired.<br /><br />This flashlight has 5 operating modes: high brightness, medium brightness, low brightness, strobe and SOS. When the power button is pressed but not clicked all the way it changes the mode of the flashlight. Pressing it all the way in so it clicks turns the whole thing on and off. The lens can be slid back and forth to move the light between brightness on a concentrated spot and diffused over a wider coverage area.<br /><br />The flashlight is made of aluminum and it is a solid and durable unit.

I was right. After reading the attached card (see first photo), it says this is not for hot liquid. I have so many cold liquid containers that I did not want another one. This is also expensive and is not worth the purchase for just a cold beverage container when it was a hot liquid container that was wanted.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it works very well for cold liquids very well. This comes in three pieces (reservoir, top, straw). The straw gets screwed into the top. The tip is pliable and has to be sipped with strong suction. My water stayed cold all night long. I did put several ice cubes in the container with my tepid water and it felt like it came out of the fridge after about 12 hours.<br /><br />In addition to its thermal properties, it is also leakproof.<br /><br />In summary, this is four stars as a cold beverage insulating container but zero stars for hot simply because the straw and tip are not suitable for that.

The rack comes with a hex wrench, but you will need a wrench to hold the bolts in place for tightening.<br /><br />The rack has rubber sleeves that fit over the hooks so there is no concern you might scratch your dumbbells. The rack is very stable, however, I wouldn't recommend allowing a toddler or a small child to play near the rack when it is loaded.<br /><br />There are five slots with wider separation at the bottom.

It also had a tendency to tip over. We had to clear the ground under it very well because the smallest stick or bump on the dirt would make it tip. After two weeks, my toddler falling into one of the posts made the post break off, leaving a jagged metal spot where it stood. There was no way to just take the net off the trampoline and keep using it because the posts that hold the net posts in place stick up about 6 inches around the edge of the trampoline, leaving metal posts around to fall on.

I had not heard of Old Timer until recently, but their knives look nice and I thought I would give them a chance. So far I am very pleased with this particular knife.<br /><br />This is a no-frills knife that doesn't try to get too fancy. The blades have to be pulled open manually without a spring assist, and it does not have some of the things that other knives frequently have such as a corkscrew, screwdriver and other integrated emergency tools. Instead it has three blades - nothing more. Each blade is different and has different uses, though the thought that comes to mind when I look at the knife as a whole is whittling and carving.<br /><br />The blades are tight and do not wobble. That's a good thing and says that the knife as a whole is assembled well. The blades feel solid and secure when opened.<br /><br />I love the bone handle. It feels good in the hand and it looks retro which is a good thing. The texture makes it easy to maintain a grip, even when hands are just a little wet.<br /><br />This is a smallish knife, so it will fit in your pocket and not take up lots of room. This is a little smaller than most knives I am used to carrying, and that's a mixed bag to me - on one hand I like having a larger knife, probably because I am used to having one, but on the other I like the fact that it is small, compact and lightweight.<br /><br />This is a very nice knife that sticks to getting the basics right without a bunch of extras that only add weight and take away from the overall package.

            "question": "title: Works as a taillight but it's practically impossible to open to install or replace the batteries\ntext: This is a 2.4 lux/4 lumen rain proof and splash proof bicycle taillight which takes 2 AAA batteries (not included). These batteries should provide 36 hours of illumination according to the package.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this light. First, it's practically impossible to remove the cover to insert the batteries. There's a notch at the bottom of the light that is used to open the compartment. I had to use a letter opener to pry it open while squeezing the top a bit. The force that had to be used damaged the plastic around the notch but did not affect the light's functionality. There are four plastic prongs that hold the top reflector onto the base and I can see these prongs breaking when opening or closing the compartment to replace the batteries.<br /><br />I have a Trek bike and it was difficult to position on my bike because the height of the light got in the way of the reflector that was already there. However, the mounting bracket is a typical bracket that clenches itself around the bike frame. The light clips onto the fastener and can be removed and used elsewhere, such as clipping onto a backpack or hat for use when walking.<br /><br />The light turns on via a button on the back. Only the top &#34;bulging&#34; part lights up as the bottom acts as a reflector.<br /><br />Because of the difficulty of opening this light and chance for breakage during battery replacement, I personally cannot recommend this. This is not a light I would purchase after having tried it.",

            "question": "title: Easy to Use, and LOUD!!\ntext: This is the first electronic whistle I have ever seen or used and I have been impressed with it so far. I was not exactly sure what to expect from it and I was curious to see how it would compare to a traditional whistle. It definitely has some advantages over a regular whistle and is very definitely worth some consideration if you officiate outdoor sports.<br /><br />This is a small and not unattractive device, about the size of a tube to toothpaste (slightly smaller) and bright yellow. It has a lanyard attached to it so it can be hund around the neck like a traditional whistle to secure to a wrist if that is preferred. One end is open and this is where the sound comes out. There’s a single button control on the side for activating the whistle, and a switch that allows for switching between two different tones and turning the whole unit off.<br /><br />The whistle takes two CR2032 batteries, included in the package. This is a relatively common battery size now so it is easy to find replacement batteries when the batteries are depleted. While AAA batteries would have made more sense to me, they would have added weight to the whistle so button batteries are a good choice.<br /><br />This is a LOUD whistle! It is a bit louder than I expected. Tone one is a traditional whistle sound and is suitable for officiating at outdoor games like soccer and football. The second tone is slightly lower and has more of a buzz two it; this tone would also work for outdoor sports, but I think it is best suited for when there are two officials and you want to differentiate between the two of them.<br /><br />I would stop short of calling this whistle waterproof but it is definitely acceptable for use outside in light rain.<br /><br />The main advantage this whistle has over a traditional whistle is the fact that it does not require any effort. You do not have to blow through it which gets tiring after a while with normal whistles. Also, because you never have to put your mouth on it, it is more sanitary.<br /><br />If you have need to use a whistle, particularly outdoors, this electronic whistle is a good choice. It is cleaner that a traditional whistle, it is at least as loud, it has two distinct sounds and is semi-waterproof.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no/minimal cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.",

For that, I prefer to pack a metal bowl and cup set.<br /><br />There are two \"plates\" at .75\" deep, and a \"bowl\" (or lid) that measures 1.5\" deep. The three items stack.<br /><br />There are 2 eating utensils. Spoon on one side, and a combo Knife and Fork on the other. The spoon and fork work fine. The knife is best for items you want to cut that don't need a lot of work to get it done. Softer, easier items are best.<br /><br />There are two cups. The base is a soft silicon that smooshes up inside. The lid/cap is attached.  It flicks open easily, yet doesn't snap tight (too bad). Comfortable enough to drink from it with cap open, or can keep it closed and drink from the small opening.<br /><br />The cups don't stand well on their own empty. They do fine with liquid inside.  One of my pictures has the pink cup leaning up against other stuff because it is empty. The green one is standing fine, but I have water poured inside.<br /><br />Everything stacks and fit together nicely. Needs harness to hold it all together.<br /><br />Nylon with mesh, draw string bag is just big enough to fit the stacked together and harnessed items.<br /><br />I tried this set at home with my lunch, so I could see how everything performed. I like the look of it, I like the materials used. I think this set would do well with an additional lid/bowl so there would be 1:1 for each set. Especially as a cup and a utensil fits nice in each plate, it would be nice to have an additional lid for one of the sets. This would allow the set to be parted out (say one for work, one for car) and/or as well as allow each user to have the exact same thing. I don't know why it wasn't arranged to be like that.<br /><br />I do like the cups, overall, and am considering toss one in my purse.",

            "question": "title: Impressive Mask with Easy to Breathe Snorkel\ntext: I have been diving and snorkeling for over 30 years and when I saw this new design of mask I was excited to try it out - I’m so glad I did.<br /><br />In comparison to the standard mask and snorkel, the viewable angles are far greater and the ease of breathing is immensely easier.  I could not believe just how easy it was to clear this snorkel after diving under water - absolutely remarkable.<br /><br />I was glad that I opted for the S/M as I’m certain the larger size would have leaked on me.  The tri point head gear allows for adequate adjustments which allowed me to make the mask snug and comfortable and not leak.<br /><br />The most impressive thing about this mask is how clearly you can see under water which is the whole point of wearing a mask in the first place.  While most masks limit your vision to a narrow field directly in front of you this is so much more open.  You really have to experience this to appreciate just how different it really is.<br /><br />I have LOVED this mask and have recommended it to several of my friends.<br /><br />This is a great product.",

He went & researched w/ budget parameters I gave him . 2days l8r, he came to me & said ,\" this one, Dad\" .<br />We mink-oiled and re-secured the quality laces. He noticed no stings in palm, no longer dropped easy popups and LOVED this glove. We had to ask him to stop professing his love of this glove. The fact that Wilson had a tag w/ Dansby Swanson on this model was an unforseen bonus which solidified it's legitimacy to the young, Braves crazed, baseball living & breathing boy.

It is warmer than the gloves that really are almost liners, say two notches above that, the silicone grip is really effective, very easy to hold things, work a steering wheel, etc.  Rest of the glove is some sort of fleece, a bit like polartec, maybe heavier than 100, closer to 200 say, but generally warm.  Not totally wind proof, but close.  Sizing on me (Large) is about what I would expect, tight across the palm (but they loosen up), fingers a bit long (but mine run short), but not too long.

            "question": "title: No instructions and cheap quality but still functional resistance bands\ntext: I expected more from this resistance band set but for the current price of $17.99 it is just okay. First, this set comes with absolutely no instructions other than what I found on the Amazon site. Second, one of the clips on the resistant band barely opens and when it does it sticks. Third, the foam on the handles does not extend the full length of the handle. Forth, the internal roll on the door anchor easily slips off.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is the lack of instructions. Nevertheless, I tried each one of these cables. The resistance is too light for me. I eventually combined all the cables onto the handles and that provides the best resistance. In that mode, this is pretty good.<br /><br />I personally will not use the door anchor as I never like using door knobs or my house framing for exercise equipment. I always feel damage will be done. In fact, I had loosened a door knob once by using that for resistance bands.<br /><br />The ankle straps are nice and they are comfortable as well due to the thin internal padding. I find it awkward to use resistance bands on the ankles, but others might like this. Once again, I feel the bands will have to be doubled up to get a good resistance.<br /><br /> IN THE PACKAGE<br />- Nylon Carry Bag with cinch tie for closure<br />- A door anchor<br />- Two cushioned handles<br />- Two Velcro ankle straps with padding<br />- 5 bands totaling 100 pounds<br />--> Yellow band = 10 lbs<br />--> Blue band = 15 lbs<br />--> Red band = 20 lbs<br />--> Green band = 25 lbs<br />--> Black band = 30 lbs<br /><br />In general, this is an okay set for upper body work. My main disappointment is the lack of instructions as there was no user manual in my set. I know the Amazon site says it comes with that, but mine did not.

I Am So Thankful For This Amazing Chair\ntext: We have had the chance during lockdown to get to do some work on our yard that we have not been able to keep up with in years past.  In a far away spot where we have to walk quite a ways, we started working on old grape vines.  I was in a lot of pain and going through exhaustion from the stress of the last few weeks, and I needed to lay down.  It would have been impossible, but this made it a whole new experience.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This is a fabulous chair. It comes in a donut type design.  It locks with a clip that has an extra button to keep it locked.  When you unwind it, you open the end of it and run around the yard or you can use the stiff plastic board tin inflate it.  Then you roll up the end and it stays inflated.<br /><br />DOES IT INFLATE EASILY?<br />It took me a few times to get the hang of this, but it did inflate pretty well whipping it through the air.  I could not seem to get the hang of the plastic paddle though.<br /><br />IS IT COMFORTABLE?<br />This is not only comfortable but it is PERFECT.  It is just the right shape, and I am VERY sensitive in my back.  Nothing ever feels right on me.  The way this feels is PERFECT!  It even has a raise area for a pillow.  It is comfortable and I don't need to put something behind my neck!<br /><br />IS IT HOT?<br />The mesh in the center of this keeps it ventilated and I love it.<br /><br />DOES IT BLOW AWAY?<br />This has a little stake that you drive through a loop at the end of the chair to keep it in the ground.  It works well.  We had some pretty intense breezes and it stayed in place well.<br /><br />DOES IT LEAK?<br />This lasts about an hour before I had to tighten it up again. I found that every hour or so, if I tightened up the back just a little bit, it was nice and full of air.  It takes some practice to get this to seal well.<br /><br />IS IT HARD TO PUT AWAY?<br />This is SO EASY to put away when done.  You just undo the back, fold it in thirds, and then roll up with the head last and it rolls up like a donut and snaps shut for storage.  It fits perfectly in the sack that comes with it.<br /><br />ANY POCKETS?<br />There is one pocket on the side of the chair for a magazine, phone, etc.<br /><br />ANY PATCHES?This came with four patches in case it needs repair.<br /><br />HOW DID IT PERFORM?<br />Having this on the lawn to rest in between working hard was a godsend to me.  It is so comfortable that it allows me to recover and go back to work.  It does not need any other cushions or pillows to use it.  I can not tell you how much I appreciated this.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For a great way to bring a lounge chair with you, this is a fabulous product.  It is not best for high winds or gravel ground, but for grass or sand with very little wind as sand won't accept the stake well, this stays put well.  It is a fantastically comfortable chair and I absolutely LOVE it.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />This chair gets FIVE STARS from me.  I love this and hope it stays inflated well.  I have never had anytyhing perform so well and be comfortable at the same time.  I love that I don't have to inflate it by blowing in it or using a pump.  This is ingenious and I am thrilled with it.<br /><br />PHOTOS<br />Photos are disabled at the time of this review, so I could not post photos for you.",

Made of a thick polyester with sturdy reinforced edges and solid grommets to string up a flag pole if desired.. it’s truly made to be displayed in a variety of ways.. hung on a balcony, up inside a window, or.. even as a tapestry on a wall- it’s the perfect size 3x5’ for multi uses- and built to withstand both, indoor or outdoor climate!<br /><br />Ordering in February.. I cannot speak for sun bleaching on the deep red color- I’m sure it may fade bc deep red usually does.. But, it’s something that could possibly be avoided by taking down at night, finding indirect sun exposure or.. just to be anticipated! Bc of its deep coloring- it seems reasonable that it would take quite a bit of time to fade out the deep color! Letting one get their $ worth.<br /><br />Big and bold print is nicely displayed with infamous Utes “U” logo and accent colors.. easy to read and see from afar. Loving the simplicity to know who/what it represents. Great for a future or current student.. a solid grad gift, or alma mater scenario- Quality from start to finish! Hoping info helps decision..  stay safe everyone.",

Inside is slippery causing legs to hike up\ntext: After reading such fantastic reviews for the Sunday Oasis Women's Tights Highwaist Sports Yoga Workout Gym Running Trouser, I am perplexed. The product post shows them as full-length yoga pants with an attractive silvery sheen, not matte grey capris. The outer seam is messed up on the right leg and it veers towards the front of my leg.<br /><br />Usually, I wear a size small in bottoms and have some mediums, but they do not fit as baggy as these. The fabric is thin and feel rough on the outside yet silky,  smooth inside.<br /><br />After turning them inside out, I realized I received a factory second, and they were sewn with the outer fabric on the wrong side with white markings on the material of both legs. Vine reviewers usually receive the very best a manufacturer has to offer and this is the first time I have received a factory second. I am so diappointed.<br /><br />Sadly,  I have to review what I received and not what I thought they would be. I must say that I love the look of the silvery fabric on the inside though.",

I thought it was nearly impossible at first, but I'm getting better fast. I think in any case it's a fun addition to a work-out / yoga / balance training regimen. I can also say that it's fun to try on different surfaces. My floors are scuffed already so I'm not too worried about that. Wood, natural slate, and various low-pile carpets...they all work more or less (smoother wood or smooth tile would be fastest and best). It's somewhat helpful to use carpet to go a little slower at first.

It worked great on the scuba mask, which is glass.  However, it didn't work at all on my plastic swim goggles which, by the way, were brand new.  The problems were: 1) Most swim goggles warn against rubbing the inside of the goggle or you lose the manufacturer's anti-fog coating.  Since I haven't mastered the art of telekinesis and I wasn't about to use my tongue as I otherwise would with spit, I had to use my finger (maybe a q-tip would have worked); and 2) if you rinse it lightly per the instructions, it works a bit better but, as other reviewers have commented, you'll burn the baby cheeses out of your eyeballs.  I've probably now ruined the anti-fog coating on my new goggles and will be returning to the old fashioned method - spit - which is free.  I'll continue to use it on my scuba mask though.",

I have shoved wood shims into the bench shaft and that has helped but I cannot adjust the seat forward or backward with the wood shims in place.  Seat attaching to adjustable shaft is also wobbly so both wobbles combined is frustrating and distracting.  The bench is not detachable so when doing flat fly's you sometimes hit the barbell rack.

Therefore,  if your stepper moves,  or gets accidently pushed,  it will be off track .....  and possibly not safe.<br /><br />Plus,  if you do pick it up,  you have to life and carry three pieces.

            "question": "title: Great lightweight backpack for simple items; it’s water resistant\ntext: This backpack is a bit unexpected in its design. It folds into the interior pocket. Therefore, the pouch that it came in is actually the inside pocket of the central compartment. All I had to do was unzip the pouch and unfold the backpack from within that pouch. I then had to pull the pouch inside out so that it formed an interior zippered pocket and tuck the loop inside.<br /><br />I think that the design is really neat. I was able to fit a couple of pounds of mandarins inside along with my wallet and a few other incidentals. I walked around with this a little bit and found it to be comfortable as long as I cinched the shoulder straps tighter. There is no padding in the straps, so walking more than one mile would most likely get uncomfortable. The material reminds me of the baggalini-type bags made of a strong nylon. However, this backpack is thin, so I do feel anything with sharp edges would tear through this after prolonged use.  The material is water resistant. I actually put part of the pack under running water and the water just rolled right off.<br /><br />There are two mesh water bottle pockets on each side and they fit my standard-sized water bottles just fine. There is also an exterior outside pocket. The tiny reflective strips at the edges of the outside pocket are a nice safety touch; however, the strips they put on the top interior of the water bottle pockets are useless unless those pockets remain empty. Someone did not think out that design.<br /><br />Overall, for the current price of $15.99 plus 5% off with a coupon savings, I feel this is a very good deal. It packs small and light and is perfect to carry around for when an extra backpack is needed. This 20 (or 22L - depending on which part of the Amazon ad one reads) size is like a full-sized backpack without any cushioning. I would not put a laptop in here unless it is protected with a padded sleeve or otterbox type case.",

            "question": "title: Enjoy Your Workout\ntext: Working out can involve many different types of equipment. I tend to prefer the workouts that need as little equipment as possible and jumping rope is a good way to workout using something that is simple and can be taken and used most anywhere. A good choice for your next jump rope workout is TINEMET Weighted Jump Rope.<br /><br />Weighing more than the typical jump rope, this heavier rope is not really a rope at all, and that is good because it can’t get tangled like an actual rope. It’s also easier to jump over than a traditional jump rope so you are less likely to trip while you use it. The cable glides across the floor with ease, in contrast to an actual rope which can sometimes cause friction when it touches the floor.<br /><br />There is more weight with this jump rope and you will notice it in the handles, which include a weight in each. If you like, you can unscrew the ends of the handles and remove the weights. I think it’s best to leave them in place, since the added weight can improve a workout. Besides, they are quite light and are certainly not heavy enough to make jumping rope uncomfortable. Another cool feature is that you can pull the rope through the handles and trim it down to size. This is great because it means that shorter individuals can adjust it to fit their needs.<br /><br />Jumping rope is a good activity to add to any workout. This TINEMET Weighted Jump Rope is a handy addition to your exercise needs. It glides and turns easily and the adjustable feature makes it usable by just about anyone. It’s a good gift idea for the exercise fans among your family and friends.",

We have inadequate lighting in our back yard, which extends back at least 15 yards (probably more), and using this flashlight in almost total darkness I could see the details of the trees and back fence while walking our dog.<br /><br />USB charging is very convenient, since it is now such a universal technology.

I needed it for a high-heat application, the cord had to resist temperatures of about 400F and retain its strength. This will certainly do that.<br /><br />Some notes, though - this is Kevlar, so it frays at the ends. To seal it, you'll want to use an epoxy or the equivalent, you cannot melt the strands together, they just glow or turn to ash. This cord is fairly abrasive compared to many other synthetics, so if it is going to be in rubbing up against other materials (or skin) damage may result. It also doesn't seem to hold knots quite as well as I'm used to, but that may be technique.<br /><br />Anyway, it worked for my purposes, so if you specifically need the characteristics of Kevlar, this is a good way to go, the quality of the product seems to be quite good. Otherwise, I'd go with a different material.",

So I ordered this set and am very happy with them.<br /><br />First I went to fill one up as a test.  Maybe I should have measured the amount of water I put in but I guessed.  When I fill the second and third ones, I will measure the amount of water going in.<br /><br />These are a large size and will require a decent size cooler.<br /><br />My first test was put in the freezer for 48 hours.  Next, I put it my new soft-sided cooler, in the house, at room temperature with nothing else inside.  I shut the cooler and left it alone for 24 hours.  After 24 hours this frozen pack was still about 90% solid.  I was impressed.  I closed the cooler and left it for another 24-hour test.  After 48 hours it was getting pretty soft, yet was still doing a good job of staying cold.<br /><br />My frequent car trips last 10-12 hours and these will definitely keep my drinks and snacks cold for those trips.  I am certain that if I used two of these and had my cooler filled that things would stay cold for days.<br /><br />I am impressed with these and highly recommend them.

Reel is still well sealed despite that.<br />The reel takes braid straight to the spool, casts like a charm especially when spooled with braid and a nice graphite surfcaster. It's hefty enough to balance out a 10ft ugly still bigwater but light enough to cast artificials with a 10ft tsunami airwave if you plan to be on the water casting all day. The conflict II is now the lightest reel penn makes, and it uses machined gears instead of cast gears, but it does cost about $70 more than this original conflict.<br /><br />I have nothing but good things to say about this reel, it's reliable without breaking the bank and doesn't have failures or shortcomings like some of the cheaper Penn reels",

At first he was a little hesitant but got used to it rather quickly.<br />I like the feature that it wont just go when turning the throttle (very important) as even when pushing it got away from him a few times when the power kicked in. Now that he is used to it, it is not a issue but I wish they had that feature on the E200 and E300.<br /><br />I do NOT wish I had gotten the larger scooters as this was perfect for him to train on.

Had to remove.\ntext: I've been wanting a Brooks saddle for a few years now and was excited when I was given a chance to try this non-leather variant (though leather would've been much preferred, yet beggars can't be choosers). I measured my sit bones and, according to my home tests and several online charts, the C17 should be right in my ballpark.<br /><br />I put it on my Trek 7.1 hybrid bike. I bike about two to three times a week during the warmer months here in Chicago and used to have a comfort seat that eventually I found much too large for when I like to ride hard and fast.<br />I didn't know what made the C17 different from the B17 at first, but after a wee bit of research I read that, because it's made of rubber, the C17 is easier to \"break in\" compared to other Brooks saddles.<br /><br />That being said, I found this to be much more *uncomfortable* than the stock seat my Trek 7.1 came with. After about two weeks' worth of riding, I found absolutely no comfort on my rear whatsoever. I could feel the seat's metal posts bearing roughly into my rear, and the breaking-in period nearly was non-existent. I'm not sure whether this is the case for all Brooks saddles or this one (or even if I've received a singularly errant model), but the seat really provides zero comfort for me.<br /><br />I like to (shamefully) boast that I have a modest tush. My rear doth extend toward the upper edge, many thanks to the number of squats I do per week. And so I feel I have an appropriately muscled bottom. But as I've never asked experts I cannot fully commit to those claims, but still I feel that the Brooks saddle causes me more discomfort than another. I've since been using a Selle saddle that costs about half the price and is far more comfortable.",

I have been using this regularly for at least the last month and I absolutely love it!!! This is a game changer! I have a Fitbit Alta that I got for Christmas. If I don't get a minimum of 250 steps in per hour, it buzzes a reminder for me to get up and move. I can twist on this for a few minutes and reach my hourly Fitbit goal. I also get on this first thing in the morning to give my steps a boost. I can earn about 1000 steps in about ten minutes or so. I rotate between twists and rocking back and forth. I weigh over 200 pounds and have not had any issues with cracking or breaking. I also have not had any problems with me knees when using it. The first few times I used it, I ended up turning in circles. It took me a while to get that under control and now I tend to stay in the same spot for most of my use. My husband made fun of me when I first started using it, but now he gets on it while playing games on the x-box. I have learned that I need to wear shoes or go barefoot when using it.

So that was a nice treat when things have been arriving late constantly. As for the boxes they arrived in the bag was a little on the heavy side but not too much. The base was extremely light and they each arrived on seperate days like they said. As for putting it together you will need 2 people. There is no way one person could do it. It wasn't difficult but the way it has to put together one person has to hold it while the other bolts it to the base. Once you get it together if your going to fill it with one or the other you should definitely fill it with sand. When you go to buy the sand it will take 2 fifty pound bags. It will take a while filling it because the hole is small. Just make sure you have it where you want it because your not moving it once it is. I would definitely recommend this bag to anyone that wants to get in shape by beating the snot out of a bag.

My 9 year old has ridden the larger scooters and didn't seem to have a problem, but is more comfortable with the slightly lower and narrower bars on this scooter.  The deck is a little narrower too, but still about the same width as a Razr A (but much shorter)<br /><br />The scooter is built like a &#34;pro&#34; scooter, with a extruded deck, welded truss to the headstock which has a high-tensile (not chromoly) steel fork, a Internal Hidden Compression (IHC) headset which is the same as &#34;HIC.&#34;  The bars are chromoly (not aluminum).  After getting the bars clamped on, a drop test showed this scooter is &#34;dialed.&#34;<br /><br />Here's a few shortcomings:  The brake is composite (plastic) instead of steel.  The fork is hi-ten steel instead of chromoly or 6061 Aluminum.  The bars are chromoly which might be heavier than Aluminum or Titanium bars but they're still awesome.  These things combine to make this scooter less expensive than typical &#34;complete&#34; pro scooters which seem to start around one-hundred fifty dollars and go up to several hundred dollars or more.<br /><br />One problem I ran into was the bar clamp was not threaded completely through.  So the bolts would bottom out on on the far-side of the clamp.  I couldn't tighten them any further and almost damaged them trying to.  I confirmed everything else was correct by using a clamp from another scooter.  Then I had to use an 8mm x 1.25 tpi tap to finish threading the clamp.  Once the clamp was threaded all the way through, it clamped the bars onto the fork just fine.<br /><br />Since the scooter is new, I can't comment on how the bearings and wheels hold up yet.

I have been playing for over 33 years now and definitely know a thing or two about volleyballs. I think these are good volleyballs for beginners since they are pretty light and therefore would be easier on their hands when playing, especially setting the ball. Seasoned players, like the ones from my team, were not big fans and their main complaint was that the ball was just too light and they felt like \"it wouldn't come back down\" comparing it to a balloon of sorts.<br /><br />The material and make of it is pretty good but the leather is a bit on the cheaper side. As i said I can't see seasoned players using this one, they will in a pinch but for the most part I can recommend this ball for beginners and also kids.",

Ironically, the implements are inside the paracord pouch, so the ziplock style bag becomes storage for as many of those as you can cram. Frankly, I think that the cardboard box that this comes in should be retained for better storage (albeit not very waterproof.)<br /><br />This is obviously a collection of last resort tools that belong in bug-out bags and emergency kits. If you maintain such a kit this is a good candidate for inclusion if you anticipate being off the grid.",

Before I go any further, I want to point out that to its' credit, this tent was easy enough for a couple of girls aged 9 and 11 to figure it out themselves.<br />That being said, I'm glad we did it at home first because I noticed at least one weird design flaw: The outer door cover is REALLY difficult to close from the inside. You see, like many tents, the doors are two layers: an outer rain flap and an inner bug-net window screen. bug net opens in the middle with a zipper, and the outer later opens on the sides (attached from the top, zipper around the perimeter).<br />This is odd because it seems like it is only designed to be closed from the outside like this! The zipper for the outer flap has an inside handle, but if the bug screen is closed, you can't reach it. I suppose you could open the bug screen all the way in order to get to the zipper, but it seems a whole lot easier to close and open both from the outside than the inside, which I wasn't expecting.<br />I'm not sure how I feel about that, I suppose it will still do the job out at a campsite, but it just feels poorly thought out.",

The Coast Double Lock Folding Knife is a very good knife for these purposes. It works well for cutting rope, carpet, and other things that are not easy to slice with ordinary knives or scissors.<br /><br />I did have some problems when I first received this knife; namely, learning how to open it and then close it back into its protective handle. With other knives, you just grab the blade and pull. That technique will not work here. I started to turn to the internet for an answer when I finally figured it out. You have to move a small, rolling piece and move another metal piece for opening/closing. It’s a little awkward, but I like that it takes effort because it is an added measure of safety. I don’t need to worry so much if one of my kids would happen to find the knife in its locked position because there is almost no way they would figure out how to open it.<br /><br />As I said, I don’t venture into the outdoors very often, so I have no need for a genuine hunting knife. But this knife is useful for much more than that. Anytime I have a difficult cutting job, like say, with heavy cardboard or rope, this knife comes to my rescue. Scissors will work for these purposes, but they take too much effort and leave you with sore fingers. This Coast knife slices through these materials with ease.<br /><br />Overall, I am happy with this knife and recommend it for household use. I cannot comment on its effectiveness in the field, but I would bet it would work well for outdoorsman, too. It’s sharp and handy and the double locking mechanism helps make it safer to use.",

            "question": "title: I am very disappointed in the quality of the material\ntext: As a person who purchases fleece to make blankets, I know my material well. This fleece material is one of the cheapest that can be purchased. If you look closely at it when it arrives (I bought it online) it looks as though its slightly clumpy or matted from the start. This means that after 4-6 washes this fleece material will definitely have a matted appearance and appear much more worn than it is. The fleece fabric used is also very thin. If you turn the jacket inside out and push your finger  firmly into the fabric, it appears that it wouldn't take much pressure to tear. I'm not suggesting gauging it with a blunt object, but it should withstand normal pushing as a clothing item will get when be put on and taken off etc. Again., thats a test us fleece blanket makers check for when purchasing fabric for a blanket that we desire to last through years of &#34;normal&#34; wear and washing. I honestly do not feel this jacket would hod up well beyond maybe 6 months.<br />Columbia is known for having quality merchandise so that is why I chose this maker. I am very disappointed in the quality of the material. I am certain the reviews on here are from buyers who received their jacket, see how soft it is, tried it on and thought it was well made and left a glowing review. I am curious to hear an update from a buyer after they have worn and washed this jacket a few times. I bought this jacket on sale for $36.00 (original price tag of $60.00) Unfortunately I  am returning it today.<br /> Old Navy is known for using VERY cheap material for a majority of their clothing, however they use much better quality fleece for their jackets. I know because I own a couple Old Navy fleece jackets. they're not as stylish as Columbia. Quite plain actually, but mine have held up for several years and still look nice.  Old Navy fleece jackets go on sale for $9.99 - $14.99 often, especially around Christmas. Looks like I'll be heading back there to pick a few more up.",

I felt it best to trust the “big guns” when it comes to athletics and sports equipment.. Ha! Adidas didn’t disappoint- they know what they’re doing and have perfected the art.. Duh!! (Shame on me for doubting there would be a difference!)<br /><br />Compared to others- these weights are leaps and bounds more compatible to the human body.. they are not just a ring of weights with a buckle, end of story! This set has been put to the test in its design and the cut.. Wow! This actually contours with the ankle or wrist- personally, I find it best fits the ankle! But, can definitely be used on either. Using a soft material this shows attention to detail in the cut.. NO sharp edges or corners to irritate the skin. Believe me- this makes all the difference. (with my cheaper set I had cotton stuffed in my sock to combat sharp edging.. which failed me btw and was so not practical!!)<br /><br />The interior sand or gel(?) used to create the weight is evenly disbursed which also is a necessity. Placement depends on muscles strengthen appropriately- and this does it’s job in spades. Note: if unsure which size weight to order.. keep in mind user activity and length of time! Trust me, even 2-3lb. seem light.. right up until 10min. into a run, workout, or even a walk- and you will feel it adding a difference! I chose 3lb. and find it compatible for those at an intermediate workout level.<br /><br />Definitely recommend and admit its worth the extra investment to purchase a set from a trusted athletic company- you won’t be disappointed!

Easier to install if bike on trainer so pedals and rear wheel move freely.<br />- you need to tell the computer the circumference of your tires. My tire size 700x45 was not listed on the chart in the instructions. It was listed on the chart on the cateye website - 2242.<br />- No tools except scissors to cut ends of zip ties (after everything is lined up and working). I also used black electrical tape to hold sensors in place while lining everything up.<br />-Important tip:  Don’t tighten any zip ties until you are sure everything is lined up and working.<br />- It seems to be functioning correctly. Not sure if its accurate?? Wont be able to tell until I ride outside and compare it to my mapmyride app.  Its one of the only computers I found that works with a trainer and is relatively inexpensive. $47.<br />To install:<br />- You need to put a magnet on a wheel spoke on back wheel and then attach a sensor to the bike chain stay. They have to be &lt; 3 mm apart.<br />- You then need to put a magnet on the crank arm thats attached to the pedal and a sensor on the bike chain stay thats &lt; 3 mm apart. You have to use a zip tie to attach the magnet. My pedal crank arm has an indentation in it, so i had to tape the zip tie to the bar so it doesn't slide around.<br />- You then take the wire attached to both sensors and attach it to the bike from the pedal up to the handle bars. You need to make sure the wire is attached so when you move the handle bars to turn the wheel, the wire is long enough and it doesn't tear or get caught.<br />- they included 10 zip ties. I used 9 of them. You need lots of patience to get it setup correctly. The magnets have to be lined up exactly with the sensors. There is a line on each sensor showing you where to line up the magnets. Its near the ends of the sensors not the middle.<br />- I have numerous items on my handlebars already - phone holder, bell, reflector, a mount for a computer.  I attached this device to the computer mount but this computer is very small so its not a great fit. I had to wrap the strap around the mount.<br />- if you snap the computer onto the holder at the end of the wire, you can unattach it, but its very hard to do. Beware. You need to pull up on front of the computer while pushing back on it. I was afraid I was breaking it or would tear the wire away from the holder. I have done it several times to test it, and it’s still working.<br />I’m giving this a 4 star review pending longer term use.

The zipper was pretty stiff to begin with, however now that I've had a chance to break it in it works fine. Definitely reccomend this bag.<br /><br />Update: used this thing in the oilfields in ND for 2 years and it managed to keep up with me the whole time. Left it out in -40°C weather as well as 110°C. It got covered in all kinds of chemicals (hydrochloric acid being one of them) and oil and grease and it still wouldn't give up. I regretfully got rid of it when I got laid off as it's time had come. After two years it only had 2 small holes from ware and the zipper no longer worked.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this bag enough, I am still surprised at how durable this thing is.

            "question": "title: Really nice rack\ntext: The rack is solid. Really easy to attach to the hitch. In our case I have to problem whatsoever to attach it when we need it and remove it right after use using the included hardware. One review mentioned that leaves it exposed to a theft, so I tossed a wrench and remove the rack while we are biking (it takes about a minute). Perhaps the greatest feature are those bike cradles and straps. We transport 3 bikes - 1 men frame, 1 women and 1 children's. They all hang at different angles, but all 3 are very solid and unmovable. The collapsible frame is a nice feature too. Once I forgot to close the door while I already had one bike attached to the rack (yeah, I was tired after a long ride :-)) Lowered the rack with that bike on it, closed the door, return the rack back to upright position and kept loading the remaining 2 bikes.<br /><br />The only (perceived maybe) con of this rack - it is a bit wobbly when it is loaded and the car is moving. When I keep that in mind and drive a bit more carefully that does not appear to be an issue. Note that bikes are attached securely and do not move at all even a little bit relative to each other or to the frame. But the entire thing wobbles slightly left and right when the car moves on an uneven pavement. I do not think this is a hitch connector issue as it fits snugly into a hitch receiver. Could be that the 1.25&#34; to 2&#34; adapter just cannot provide enough support. Or maybe that's the inherent weakness of hitch-mounted racks (the connection to the receiver cannot be rigid enough). Or both... Take into account that this is our first rack and I have no experience whatsoever with other racks. They probably all wobble, I just do not have a good reference to say whether this wobbles more or less.",

            "question": "title: Definitely best for older toddler 3+ yr old..\ntext: Solid balance bike- one that feels sturdy and brings confidence in its overall structure.. light blue has a retro feel. Bike has easy construction and one just needs to attach the seat with included tool and you’re ready to go! Note: Seat can be adjusted up or down.. photos included show seat at its lowest level- still a bit too high for our 31 mo. old..<br /><br />I also compared photos of the balance bike sized just below this bike.. and you can see it is a large jump up in size! Wish there was a size in between.. bike is light and easy to control, its one a toddler can hold up under his own merit. Solid tires compiled of materials vs. air means no flat tire to worry about. Spongy neoprene handles help grip- but the issue comes in the ability to touch the ground!! Leg length is too short- this is from a toddler in the 53% for height and weight so, I expect it to be the same results for others as well…<br /><br />*while learning to balance- bike can be used indoors.. if it hasn’t gone outside to dirty tires first. Something I’d suggest mastering prior to outdoor concrete!<br /><br />The only structural issue or change id prefer to see- is the foot pegs to rest feet on be a bit bigger. With a toddlers dexterity it’s hard for them to balance feet on the tiny 1x1” platforms. The feet struggle to find the spot and stay put.. I am hoping as he ages up this will fix itself.<br /><br />A great gift and fun way to entertain and promote healthy exercise.. this can grow with a child and has integrity to last while they size out of riding bike. Hoping info helps your decision- stay safe everyone!",

            "question": "title: Handy and a bargain, but read the limitations before making a final decision\ntext: I received these as a free review sample. They are excellent for shelter, porch or patio lighting, or even as a path finding light. They are not a good substitute for a torch-style light because the LEDs are bright and cover 360 degrees, making them inconvenient for close in repair work at night. That is not an issue or flaw, but I need to mention it because it's surprising how many folks have never used a lantern-type light and how disappointed they are to discover some of that style's limitations.<br /><br />In a tent these are bright enough to illuminate a lot of area, but not especially bright for reading. That depends on your eyes. At 67 I need a strong light and this is not sufficient, but for a younger person this will probably work for reading.<br /><br />There are only two modes: On and Off. Pull up and they immediately illuminate. The three batteries that ship with each unit are non-rechargeable, so the eight or so hours I got from them make them expensive for anything more than overnight camping unless you invest in a good set of rechargeable batteries and a solar charger like this one: [[ASIN:B000XD9O2E Solar 2 in 1 Folding Panel, Power supply, AA and AAA battery charger.]]<br /><br />Also be aware of the fact that while this is fairly impervious to inclement weather there are some limitations. Foremost is it has to be off the ground because the screw off cover for the battery compartment is not completely water proof. Hanging from a branch or raised above the water level, though, will allow it to operate without issues. If you absolutely need to use this in a wetter environment you can fashion a gasket or O-ring from neoprene that would seal the compartment. Again, not a design flaw (especially at the list price), but something of which you should be aware.<br /><br />Bottom line: for me these are handy. I have one in my vehicle for emergencies, and another in my enclosed patio. They are not a light I would use all the time because of battery consumption, but are very convenient (and effective) when I need to illuminate an area quickly.",

            "question": "title: Great Glove For Beginners Works Great - Our Daughter Loves It\ntext: My daughter is a new baseball player.  She really wanted a glove that she could use that was her own and not borrowed.  Although she did not play a fielding position a whole lot, she still found it useful.  I was more of a real leather fan of gloves, but this one is a nice glove, especially for anyone starting out in baseball.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS GLOVE LIKE?<br />This glove is not genuine leather.  It is soft grippy faux leather that has a nice curvy fit to it.  The inside has a thumb loop in it which helps to control the glove when using it.  The pocket is soft, yet tough and woven stripes of faux leather that is black in color.  The inside has faux fur strip on the back of the hand, and the inside is slick enough to allow the glove to be put on and taken off quickly without being too slick.  There is an adjustable tab to help tighten the thumb area, if necessary.<br /><br />HOW DID THIS GLOVE PERFORM?<br />My daughter is thrilled with this glove.  She said that even when she was playing catcher it was a great glove.  She had good control, was able to grab the ball with ease and accuracy.  She loves the thumb loop inside.<br /><br />CON<br />More velcro to adjust the thumb loop would be nice<br /><br />WHAT SIZE HAND?<br />My daughter has a medium size ladies hand with shorter fingers than most women.  I have a medium to large sized hand with longer fingers. This glove fits both of our hands nicely.  Our son has a medium to large man's hand and it does not fit his hand.  I would say that this is for a small man's hand, larger youth hand, or a medium to large women's size hand.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Although she wishes that the adjustment for the thumb was a bit longer velcro, this glove has been a wonderful glove for our daughter as she begins to play baseball.  It fits very well, is comfortable for longer periods of time, yet comes off easily if necessary.  It worked well for all of her positions played including catcher.  This glove remained pliable and worked very well allowing for accuracy and gripping action.<br /><br />FIVE stars for this glove.  It is a hit in this family (for those who can wear it)",

Parts all came in good condition with no dents, scrapes or missing parts. Putting on the springs weren't as hard as I imagined. The last small screws that went in were the hardest and took a lot of elbow grease. Some of the very top horizontal curved bars face more inward than others so it was hard to tell which way they went. Could use a label since you can't tell until you have them up if they are the right direction. Overall I liked almost  everything about this, except the last part of tying the elastic straps on. There are A LOT of them and wasn't sure if I should be double knotting or single knotting them. Wish there was a better way to secure it than individually knotting all the straps. I was able to do almost all of the assembly by myself, but used some help when putting on the net. But I think one person could do it all just fine. Took about an hour and half to assemble. This is a good size if you have a small yard. Both granddaughters fit on it just fine even though it says one person only. It has good bounce to it as well. For the price, I would probably buy the 7ft little tikes trampoline without the LOL graphics or 7ft Best Choice trampoline. They are both almost $100 less expensive.",

I was concerned about the non-separated pieces around the edges but they are holding up well.<br />The case is smaller than I expected. With all of the reinforcements & thick seal on the outside, there is a diminishing return of space on the inside with smaller sizes. The dimensions in the description are quite accurate. I have a holstered G26 in my pictures & it turned out to be tight. A 1911 might fit but would be happier in a larger case.<br />I have Pelican cases & the ones from the tool store.

I like tea bottles over cups as I am a lot less likely to spill tea in a bottle versus a cup, so I have several that I keep on my desk. I was interested in trying this tea bottle, and it has worked out well for me so far.<br /><br />One thing that is different about this bottle is the screen. The screen is located at the bottom of the bottle, not at the top. It also is bigger than most, being slightly larger than a 35mm film tube. The holes in it are small enough to keep larger particles form getting the tea but they are not small enough to keep something like fine tea leaves (or regular ground coffee) out.<br /><br />The bottle is borosilicate glass and is single layer. So, to compensate for the lack of insulation the bottle comes with a sleeve that keeps you from burning your hand and also helps to keep the contents of the bottle hot (or cold, as appropriate). The sleeve is easy to put on and take off.<br /><br />The bottle comes with two bottle brushes and a handle for those brushes. The brushes are simply foam heads on a plastic handle but they are sufficient for properly cleaning out the bottle.<br /><br />So far this bottle has worked out well for me. I am happy with it.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

I usually go by the philosophy that you get what you pay for when purchasing firearms, knives, daggers or any weapon in general.  This is the exception in my opinion because it is very reasonably priced and feels good in your hand.  Normally I don't like any design or added stuff on my knives but the design is really good looking.  I could do without the silver shiny skulls personally  but it your hold it  correctly it's covered any way.  The blade was extremely shard out of the box and that's not always the case, especially with lower cost knives.  The assisted opening has a bit too much resistance for me but it still very good.  I like the stainless steel blade and it can be thrown if you know what you are doing.  It's not center balanced or designed for throwing, but with a little practice or instruction you can learn to throw almost any knife.  I really didn't think I was going to like this purchase and was going to give it as a gift, but decided to add it to my collection instead.",

My family laughed at me.  They are not laughing now.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This came in a box with all of the legs tied back to the trampoline with elastic cords.  Each leg is shock corded with metal shock cords, much like you find in a tent.  That means that when you want to put it away, you won't be losing any legs.<br /><br />HANDLE<br />The handle that comes with it is optional.  You can use the trampoline with or without it.  It is not hard to put together and it is good if you are hard with balance and need some stabilizing when first using the trampoline.<br /><br />SPRINGS<br />The springs of this are very sturdy and well made.  I was surprised at how nice they were.  They easily held up to 250 lbs of everyone who tried it.<br /><br />SURFACE<br />The surface is easy to use barefoot or with shoes on.<br /><br />EDGES<br />The edges are protected so that if you wander in your bouncing that you won't hit the edges and plow through the springs as easily.<br /><br />DOES IT HELP?<br />I have to say that despite the silliness of the sound, if you just gently bounce on this, it does take a lot out of you and it really does help keep in shape.  I intend to use this regularly this winter.<br /><br />PROBLEMS?<br />I had only one problem.  When I put the legs into place, it is very hard to get them out once it has been used.  I think I will put silicone spray on it or something in the future.  I want to fold it flat, using the elastic ties that it comes with for easier storage when not in use.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />A great exercise unit, this is sturdy, well made, and easy to use.  It does fold flat for easier storage, but the frame is stable and strong.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />I like this.  It really works, feels good to use, and once I get the leg thing worked out, I am sure I will be loving this all winter.",

I have a 2006 Toyota Camry Solara Convertible and the box says it will not fit years 1993 to 2008. Nevertheless, I decided to see for myself. Due to the way the bike rack is configured, the top bar almost comes off the trunk.  As a result, there would be room for only one bike as the track adjusts back and forth depending on how tight it has to be cinched (based on the car model, of course). There are two provided clips that go through the holes to keep the track from sliding after the correct length is reached.<br /><br />I then wanted to try this on my boyfriend's car which is a 2010 Honda Accord and it also will not fit that either without a special part. Overall, I am disappointed. I had automatically assumed bike racks were universal and did not realize that was not the case. I also did not realize that there is a chart that can be consulted to check for fit. That was my mistake.<br /><br />Despite this, based on what I have noticed with this rack, the instructions are not very good. Both my boyfriend and I tried to figure them out and found them confusing. In addition, neither one of us believe this would fit three bikes unless the top rod was fastened all the way out and I doubt one would have that option on every car. Had this worked on my car, I would have given this three stars based on my other observations.",

It might be hard for it to go through anything more than the frame and possibly lock on a structure that thieves can't move. Most likely I will have to use this lock in combination with other locks to get enough length to secure all the wheels and still reach a structure to keep the bike from being dragged away. The included cable is nice to be included. Just not sure how well it would survive a cut attack.<br /><br />While D-Lock style locks seem to be the best to stop average thieves. Until a real pro thief tries to steal your bike. Its hard to say how well this lock will do. It looks like this Sigtuna lock and the 2 other locks I have should do the trick to keep my bike mine.<br /><br />I will also mention that a regular tube style frame is fine for the lock holders for the D-Lock and cable.

I am 5' 11'' tall, with a 31'' inseam, 38-40&#34; waist, 46-47&#34; chest, 52&#34; around my shoulders, and 34&#34; arms with only 13.5&#34; biceps. I gained a lot of weight last year so 3 months ago I hooked up a harness in my pool and lost 20 lbs. swimming 1-3 miles per day in a NeoSport XSpan 3/2mm 2XXL full wetsuit.  Now at 227 lbs I am aiming for about 205-210 lbs. by spring, but the water temp cooled to 68 degrees and the 3/2mm wetsuit was no longer sufficiently warm. Water was flushing in my neck and back quite a bit.  I first layered a 1.5mm neoprene shirt under my 3/2mm wetsuit and got more warmth and less flushing, but arm flexibility was compromised.<br />I decided to test the following 3 backzip wetsuits, and I really hoped the Hyperflex Voodoo would be my best choice for swimming in waters that might hit around 45 degrees;<br /><br />1.  Hyperflex Voodoo 4/3mm XXL (LFS)<br />2.  O'Neill Epic 4/3mm XXL (GBS)<br />3.  O'Neill HEAT 4/3mm XXL (LFS)<br />4.  Quiksilver Syncro 5/4/3mm XXL (LFS)<br /><br />1. Hyperflex Voodoo 4/3mm XXL (LFS) My first shock was that  the Voodoo was the hardest suit to put on by far (even over a thin lycra bodysuit) partly because of the non-slip fleece lining, but also because the arms were very tight on my skinny arms, and the suit was extremely tight around my shoulders. I had to have help pulling the floodgate over my head, and zipping the suit up.  I am surprised I did not feel terribly choked by the floodgate or by the wetsuit neck when zipped up. Even though the tightness in the shoulders was stretching the neck piece a little, the neck piece still remained comfortably snug.  Over all I felt like I was in a 5mm standard 50% flex neoprene wetsuit rather than a 100% stretch suit. This XXL was terribly restrictive of my shoulders and arms, and it felt like I feared a XXL-Short wetsuit might feel.  I knew I'd be warm in this suit even in 45-50 degree water, and I'd have very little if any water flushing, but I could not imagine swimming 1/2 mile in this suit even after wearing it for over an hour indoors because if the lack of flexibility in the arms and shoulders.<br /><br />2.  O'Neill Epic 4/3 mm XXL (GBS)<br />AND<br />3.  O'Neill HEAT 4/3mm XXL-short (LFS)<br /><br />The 2 O'neill suits both went on extremely easily, which shocked me, and both fit me absolutely perfectly even thought the HEAT was a 2XL-Short and the Epic just an XXL.  I purposely didn't stretch the Epic 4/3mm out when I put it on though it would have stretched out a bit in length in the legs if I needed it to. The HEAT fit me perfectly EVERYWHERE.  The Neoprene in both suits was absolutely buttery, and both felt far more flexible than the Voodoo 4/3mm or than a NeoSport Xspan 5mm had felt a month earlier.  The heat retention of the front panel in both suits was immediately evident.  The Liquid Fluid Seal over all the seams on the HEAT 4/3mm suit were totally stretchy, and the added back heat panels convinced me I would be significantly warmer in the Heat 4/3mm than in the Epic 4/3mm suit with GBS seams.  My only initial complaint with both O'neill suits was that the shape of the neck put a little pressure on the front of my throat - perhaps because my posture is not great and I stand with my head tilted forward a little (genetic trait) - but this issue became completely unnoticeable once I took the Heat 4/3mm and then the Epic 4/3mm into the water.<br /><br />4.  Quiksilver Syncro 5/4/3mm XXL (LFS) - For a cold water suit, this would have been my second choice behind the O'neill HEAT with LFS. It went on easily even with the back floodgate, and I was able to zip it up without help from my wife. The Neoprene felt absolutely wonderful and stretchy, the seams were Liquid-Fluid Sealed and not just GBS seams, and the suit felt totally comfortable once zipped up.  My arms and shoulders had easy and full range of motion and I knew I could swim miles warmly in this suit.  My only issue and reason for spending $70 more on the O'neill HEAT was that the QuikSilver Syncro 2XL was at least 3 inches too long for me in the legs because I have shorter legs and a longer torso.  The arms were also a little long for me, bulging a little around my biceps, but fitting snugly and sealing well at my wrists and all the way up my forearms. If I lose the 20 lbs. the O'neill HEAT XXLS will still fit me well, but the Quiksilver Syncro XXL would then become way too loose.<br /><br />My wife watched me try on and compare each suit, and since the O'neill HEAT 4/3mm obviously fit me the best and had the features I needed to swim long distances in cold water, after trying on the other suits I immediately made my decision and kept the O'neill HEAT 4/3mm suit on.  I threw on some 5mm NeoSport booties, donned a swim cap and 3mm Neosport gloves, stepped down into a pool of 58 degree water (not feeling the slightest chill), hooked myself into the swimming harness and immediately went face first into the water to swim a mile.  Only my cheeks were a little chilled at first. I felt NO water getting in through the neck, or the seams of my O'neill HEAT wetsuit. I felt No Chill at all !!!  In fact, after about a quarter mile I pulled down on the front collar to let in a little water in to cool me down in the suit.<br /><br />After loving the O'Neill Heat, and looking at the recommended water temperature range of 45 degrees and up, I decided to try the O'Neill Epic 4/3mm GBS in the water. I jumped into the 58 degree water and felt a little more cooling water seeping in than with the HEAT, but I was warmed up from the mile swim so I decided to swim another 1/2 mile.  I decided to keep the O'neill Heat 4/3mm for cold waters 45 degrees and up, the O'neill Epic 4/3mm for 56-57 degrees and up, and my Neosport XSpan 3/2mm would for waters 68 degrees and up.<br /><br />I  hope this free personal testimony about these wetsuits helps you make your next decision about the wetsuit that is right for you.",

            "question": "title: 4 Stars For This Senior Citizen But 5 Stars For Most People\ntext: The photo above was taken in the evening about an hour and a half before sunset. The lantern has four settings - low, medium, high, and flashing and in the photo it is set on medium. You can see how bright that is. In the dark, the low setting is about on a par with most regular flashlights. The high setting lights up a dark room. The lantern is lightweight, making it very portable, but it doesn't feel at all flimsy. Instead, the unit has a sturdy heft to it.<br /><br />One of the nicest features of this lantern is the Battery Guard which prevents the batteries from slowly draining away over time. Maybe once every 12-18 months we'll lose power in my area for an extended period. I got this lantern as emergency lighting in such situations so I don't end up sitting in the dark until the power company gets the problem resolved. That means my lantern will be sitting on the shelf for upwards of a year or more between uses. You can see why I like that Battery Guard function so much.<br /><br />Why the four star/five star distinction in the title? As a 70 year old guy with some health issues it's getting harder and harder for me to do a lot of physical things. Getting the batteries into the lantern caused a bit of a hassle for me, things which more able-bodied folks probably wouldn't even notice. First, of the four D batteries it needs, two need to go in one direction and two in the other. If I hadn't noticed at the last second where the + and - signs were, I'd have put them in wrong. That would only have been an issue because getting the cover back into place over the batteries was a bit of an effort for me. I had to brace the lantern upside down on a countertop and press hard to get that cover far enough down for me to screw it back on. That was my own weak muscles though. Most people would be able to put the batteries in without any problems at all, which is why I am giving this a full fiver star rating. I think it's an excellent product.",

It is softer than the floor, but not by much.  I have wanted a mat to bring with me in the car in case I had to use it on a sudden overnight.  I also wanted something I could quickly inflate to put in the deck if I wanted to lay out.  Let's take a look.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This comes in a nice pouch.  It closes nicely and has a lock on it.  Inside are inflating instructions.  There is also a patch inside which is nice too if you need to patch up the mattress.<br /><br />HOW DOES IT WORK?<br />This is so fascinating.  In the bag, it does not take up much room.  I would put it equivalent to rolling up a queen sized top sheet by folding in fourths and rolling it up. Maybe a tiny thicker than that.<br /><br />You unscrew the cap once it is open and suddenly the air starts to fill the mattress.  If you are in a hurry, you can blow in it unless it is cold out then it is not recommended.  Once you have it where you want it, then you can screw it back closed and lay on it.<br /><br />HOW DOES IT FEEL?<br />This is surprisingly comfortable.  I had it on my very hard wood deck and was amazingly comfortable laying on my back- something that is not what I can normally do without a mattress.  It is not super thick, but the foam and air combo make for a nice supportive experience taking the edge off of the hardness of the deck.<br /><br />HOW HARD IS IT TO PUT AWAY?<br />Putting away was very fast too.  I just opened the cap, and gently rolled bottom up and then re-rolled again to get all of the air out.  It takes some practice, but it was put away in just a few minutes.  It actually fits in the bag without having to struggle a lot like some products of this nature.<br /><br />HOW LONG IS THIS?<br />This is quite long.  I would say that this would take someone up to 6ft tall at least easily.  The foot area is not too big, but it is nice.<br /><br />DOES IT SQUEAK?<br />There was not any noise when using this.  It also did not slide all over the place, another thing I can not stand.<br /><br />CAMPING<br />If you take this camping, I would make sure it has a double tarp under it or a tarp and tent floor at least.  You want to protect this from rocks and sharp objects as it can tear, despite being pretty tough.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is not only fabulously bright and cheerful, but it is ingenious.  The foam air combo is perfect for me.  It works on the deck and also on a very hard mattress.  It is small enough to keep in the car or travel with and will fit in a tent nicely.  It is fast to set up and take down too.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS. I love this mattress more than the others I have tried.  It is the one that I am keeping in my car as my husband fell for another one I have so he can sleep in other locations from time to time when he has to.",

These must be puzzle connected to charge both sides.. so, follow instruction insert bc it’s beyond easy. *Lowest heat option = lasts longest. X3 levels feel comparable to basically: heat or no heat!! Full charge realistically lasts 8hrs.<br /><br />Idea like that of disposable hand warmer.. but will provide a more lucrative source of heat.. My daughters a college coach and sidelines get cold in rain/snow + standing still!! Tucked in a pocket these generate heat to keep chill away..A perfect gift that comes boxed and ready to go! Ideal for athletes, winter dog walk, outdoor work, winter sport fan, ski lift operator etc.  A little heat goes a long way for comfort!! Hoping info helps decision- stay safe everyone.",

            "question": "title: Not exactly a blanket, but is highly useful for the beach or other things\ntext: When I received this as a review sample I was surprised by how compact it was - it was folded in a bag that measured less than 12 inches by 10 inches and a little over an inch thick. It's definitely compact and easy to store.<br /><br />The design is clever, but I am going to avoid repeating the product description or Comdet's detailed July 26, 2014 review. I actually took this to a stretch of beach in Daytona Beach Shores to test it out. The sand is fairly hard packed so the metal stakes were sufficient. If you intend to use this on a beach that is sandier you may want to use different stakes that will stay in the ground. The loops on the corners will fit just about any stake you can buy. Of course, if you want to increase your load, four paving stones, which fit into the sand pockets - plus the stakes - will probably keep this in place regardless of the breeze. That is the main issue with this or any other beach blanket because a little wind under this 7x6 foot blanket turns it into a large sail.<br /><br />I love the material for keeping sand off things. It's thin, super thin,in fact, so it's more of a sand barrier that you can lay on as long as you find a comfortable spot on the beach. Note that this is purposely not waterproof, so it cannot be used as a tarp in a rain. On the other hand, it will dry very quickly and it your beach spot has a wash station you can rinse this to remove all sand, and it will dry in literally minutes.<br /><br />Now that I have tested it for what it was designed to do my use is as a dust cover for my drum kit. I have two set up in my studio and they collect dust (even if I play them every day), so this will be going over the one I use least. The cool thing is this 'blanket' will function for a number of purposes between visits to the beach. It's light, can be secured to corners and will even block the sun on that south side window. Let your imagination run amok.",

Won't lay flat.\ntext: I got this new blanket, washable, waterproof, and soft on one side, thinking it would be a no problem replacement for the similar, current, 4 yo blanket I have right now for my dog. The older blanket was perfect because it stayed flat , never slid, keeping all of her chewies & treat dispensing toys on it rather than tossed all over the room like it did when I used large towels instead.  Towels bunch easily and never stay in place.<br /><br />As it had food on it, even though the food was dry, eventually I needed to wash it, but wasn't sure it was washable. Even tho I washed it in cold water and hung it to dry, it no longer lays flat and it is as useless to me as when I used towels. All her stuff is tossed all over the room again. I was able to realize that the lumps and bumps it has because it can't lay flat is where my dog starts to ball it up as dogs would do to a towel and that causes everything to scatter.<br /><br />I realized I needed a replacement that could be washed and can stay flat at all times.<br /><br />This new blanket, right out of the packaging, has all 4 corners curling up and it does this due to tension caused by the hemming of the blanket.<br /><br />Sending it back.<br /><br />Very disappointed as it took so long for me to find a suitable replacement.... well, I guess not so suitable.",

            "question": "title: Weapon of Bass Destruction\ntext: I love to go freshwater fishing and this weekend I approached the lake with a brand new weapon - a KastKing Sharky 6000 spinning reel. This is a serious reel that made a good day of fishing even better.<br /><br />I will start by saying that even though it is approximately the same weight as my primary reel - a KastKing Orcas 4000 - it is significantly larger. I spooled on over 200 yards of 10-lb. test fluorocarbon line and it still had room for more line on it. I put it on an 8' limber rod and headed out to a productive spot.<br /><br />I am very fussy about my reels and I expect them to meet several criteria. I want a good cast range, a smooth cast, smooth retrieve, quiet operation and a zero-reverse clutch. There has to be enough clearance between my knuckles and the bail to keep it from rapping me on the knuckles when I retrieve. And finally, the drag has to work and be easy to set. The Sharky met every one of these requirements.<br /><br />I learned fast (and the hard way) that the reel is more than accommodating when it comes to casting and more than once I sent my lures into the trees instead of to the edge of the bank when I was unable to hit the bank with other reels on identical rods. This required a little adjustment on my part but it meant I did not have to work as hard and it also meant I could hit farther targets when I wanted to. So, when I fish from the bank I have a better range into whatever water I am fishing.<br /><br />The retrieve is glassy smooth and very fast too. Not once did I have a problem with snarled line on the retrieve when I had near-zero load which is a problem on some reels. I like that I could bring in the line very quickly when needed (like for grabbing the net to assist another fisherman). The reel is quiet when spinning - not silent, but quiet.<br /><br />When the ant-reverse clutch is engaged there is no reverse at all. To me this is a sign that the reel is quality made and is assembled well. I really, really dislike reels that do not have a zero-reverse clutch, and even worse is a reel that has one but it still has just a little play in it. The Sharky’s zero-reverse is solid and works exactly like it’s supposed to work - absolutely zero reverse.<br /><br />The bail spins an inch or so away from my knuckles but never once has it hit my hand when spinning.<br /><br />The drag set is uniform and smooth and does not really get harder to turn until close to the end of the tightening range.<br /><br />In appearance this is a very attractive reel, black and red with a little bit of chrome. It is surprisingly lightweight for the size. I have bigger hands than average so a reel this size that doesn’t add much more weight is very welcome.<br /><br />The reel helped me land a good variety of fish including largemouth bass, crappie and a near-citation yellow perch. The most exciting catch was a largemouth bass which was not huge but not small either and provided the best test of the reel under stress, and the reel brought this fish to the boat easily without incident. Even under the load of a fighting bass the reel was just as smooth in operation as when retrieving a test plug.<br /><br />I am very, very pleased with the Sharky 6000 and will be using it again in the same lake in a few weeks. It has not let me down even once and it works very well. If you want a larger reel that works great and does not add a lot of weight to your gear, take a very close look at this reel.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

Got it in the mail and took it out and one of the side table chrome playe fell of and the Paul Jr designs label was popping up.

I was already annoyed at this point since it was a gift for my husband and I couldn't wait for him to see it. As heavy as it is te lid is really flimsy and I think needs heavy hinges and better latch. That's not all though... and took it camping right away 2 days later. My husband turned it on and the popping sound started and he opened it and black flakes flying everywhere. Stupid me didnt pack a campfire grill grate just in case and we ended up having to cover the grates in aluminium foil for our steaks and brats and use the camper microwave and futch oven for everything else! What a pain. We were super dissapointed. Should have got the original. 3 of our camping friends have te original and love it. We love our Weber Genesis at home so we did a return instead of a replacement and are going to get the Weber Q. I should have listened to the other negative reviews but thought Coleman would have fixed the issues by now- guess not!",

            "question": "title: Glass vs. ANY type of plastic?  Glass wins!\ntext: I am a big iced tea drinker yet began to stop drinking so much after finding the taste of my home brewed green tea lately not so good.  I was using BPA-free plastic containers to make and store the tea in when I came across an article about using glass for a much purer taste.<br /><br />I searched Amazon and came across these bottles.  The price was right (cheaper than the manufacturer's website price) and the user ratings pretty good.  Combining these bottles with a glass Pyrex measuring cup to make the tea I have noticed an immediate improved taste.  I allow the tea to cool before pouring it into the bottles (I read if you place the tea in when it's hot the cap might seal so tightly you may have difficulty opening the bottle) and it tastes great now!<br /><br />I use 3 bottles for tea and the other three for water (which also tastes much better vs. BPA-free plastic).  I am planning to get a small fridge for another room and will buy another case of these bottles to store tea and water in.",

I wanted comfort: firstly not making my back sticky and hot, and secondly being easy to wear loaded for 6 or more hours in a day.  It passed both criteria with flying colors.  There are bigger and smaller sizes, so you can get just what you need for your purposes, they should be just as comfortable.<br /><br />The minor negatives I have are:  (1) Ideally there would be a few more small compartments for things like wallets and phones and keys.  It's easy to lose things in the depths when small items are packed in with fleece pullovers and jackets and granola bars and such.  (2) It's pretty hard to reach back to grab and pull out your water bottles: I ended up working with my travel partner to help each other out for this.  I'd prefer a way to set those just a bit forward, and put the little waist packs behind perhaps.<br /><br />Overall I'm sold on Osprey backpacks, and would buy one again quite happily.",

            "question": "title: Why This Tent Is Special To Me-What Kind Of Camping It Is Good For (IN DEPTH REVIEW)\ntext: WARNING= THIS IS A VERY IN-DEPTH REVIEW.  FOR A BRIEF SUMMARY, SEE SECTION MARKED THE BOTTOM LINE<br />-------------------------------------<br />It was a time of great sorrow and difficulty as our family was dealing with the death of a dear and faithful friend.  Sometimes it gets so overwhelming that we just wanted a place to get away.  That is where this tent comes in.  Let's take a look.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS TENT LIKE?<br />This tent is a beautiful aqua green color- sort of like seafoam green with a green fly and trim.  I am going to review each aspect of this tent in a different section:<br /><br />FABRIC<br />This is a thin tent.  It has very thin but strong nylon.  The floor is heavier than the rest of the tent, and the fly is slightly thicker as well.<br /><br />SEAMS SEALED?<br />I was interested to see the seams of this tent sealed with observable shiny seal on the seams,, especially on the floor.<br /><br />POLES<br />The poles are fiberglass on the top dome, and the side poles are metal.<br /><br />CORNERS<br />The corner pieces are an intersection which is made from a plastic looking material.  They have a prong that sticks out to hold the fly away from the tent.<br /><br />CASE<br />The case is a squared case which zips shut and fits the tent, fly, and all of the pieces fit well into it.  The instructions are also sewed into the case so you do not lose them and they won't get ruined by rain.<br /><br />CEILING<br />The ceiling of the tent is a micro mesh.  If you have a beautiful day, the top is gorgeous to leave open- even in warm weather with no threat of rain.<br /><br />FLY<br />The fly is really nice.  It is like in the picture, but what is really cool about this is that the fly has a LOT of room between the tent ceiling on the fly.  It is water repellant and seems to hold up well if it is staked to the ground.  The fly has a grommet which fits under the corner poles to help hold it down.<br /><br />CLIPS<br />The tent and the fly have clips on them which snap onto the poles.  They are plastic.  I also opt to put a metal carabiner/D hook in the loop of the tent and fly and clip it around the poles for extra sturdiness.<br /><br />FLOOR<br />Although this floor is sealed and is thicker than the rest of the tent, it still needs to have a tarp underneath- be careful not to let the tarp edges stick out or they can become a rain funnel.  Leave an inch or two around the edges for run off should it rain.<br /><br />WINDOWS<br />The windows of this tent do not zip.  The back wall has no window.  The sides have two large windows which have toggle closures.  There are loops halfway down the edges so that you can either have the window closed, or halfway open.  You can also have them rolled up and all of the way open.<br /><br />FRONT WINDOW IN DOOR<br />The front window in the door has a zipper around it for easy closure.  You can open that as much as you like.<br /><br />FRONT DOOR<br />This has a two way zipper in it so that you can easily open to leave the tent or go back in without having to open the WHOLE door.  You can also zip up to the lower corner to allow for electric cord should you need it.<br /><br />CADDY<br />The caddy that comes with this has mesh pockets in it.  There are quite a few storage areas and it will hold a lot of lightweight gear, glasses, phones, keys, etc.  There are many loops around the edges of the tent to put the caddy so it is versatile.<br /><br />LAMP HOOK<br />There will be a center hook in the ceiling for hanging a fan or lamp.  There are rechargeable lamps and fans out there you can also use on this hook as well as traditional lanterns.<br /><br />POCKETS<br />There are a few pockets sewn into the tend up off the ground as well as the caddy for plenty of storage.<br /><br />CAN THIS BE PUT UP BY ONE PERSON?<br />That is the amazing thing about this tent.  One of our kids put this up by herself.  We wanted to test how hard it was and surprisingly, she did it without any help at all!  The side poles have stakes in them which you push into the ground (not traditional stakes, but part of the pole itself).  Once you do that the rest of the tent is easy to do, including staking the tent and the fly.<br /><br />STAKES<br />The stakes with this are pretty shallow.  They work in hard ground, but if you expect winds or are in sandy ground, I would suggest different stakes.<br /><br />HEAD ROOM<br />This tent is fantastic for standing up in.  Plenty of head room make it comfortable for dressing and moving around.<br /><br />DOES IT FIT INFLATABLE MATTRESS?<br />We used a queen sized inflatable mattress and it fit (this is a four person tent) perfectly with enough room to walk around the edges and put backpacks and a few other items.<br /><br />HOW MANY PEOPLE?<br />Although this says that it will fit four people, that would be a tight fit.  For two people there is plenty of room for equipment and even a mattress, but for four people, you will have to be roughing it and squeeze in tightly.  Three people would fit okay but again it will be roughing it and a bit tight.<br /><br />WHY IS THIS SPECIAL?<br />This tent offered us a way to escape the stress of losing our friend and go camping in the yard.  It is really comfortable for two people and it is bright colored and easy to use.  We really enjoyed using it.<br /><br />WIND<br />We had medium wind and the tent held up.  I can not stress enough that you get GOOD stakes and stake everything down well - fly and tent.<br /><br />RAIN<br />We did not have any rain the entire time we used this tent, so I can not report on severe storms.  A light mist did not hurt it, but most tents won't be bothered by that.  Severe wind with the rain will cause the windows to puff open at the top and you will get some spray if you don't run lightweight tarps down over then on the outside (secured on all corners).<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS TENT BEST FOR?<br />This tent in my opinion would be best used for easy camping.  Severe weather is not probably going to work well with this if sustained for a long period of time.  Because of the lack of back window, the circulation is not as good as if it had one.  However, for cooler weather, that is good- it allows for more warmth.  I would say that this is a good tent for decent weather.  It will stand up for a while under storms, but severe winds and driving rains more than a short stint would probably not leave this tent doing as well as a tent made for more severe weather.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For a really nice tent which is great for good weather camping, cooler weather camping, and brief occasional storms, this tent is a greeat choice.  The color is refreshing, it is comfortable, has good storage and is well laid out.  For more severe weather, I would not suggest it, but it will hold up for unexpected things now and then if you carefully stake it and set it up well.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  If you use this for the weather it was designed for, this is an excellent tent.  We love it.  Then again, we did not have severe extended weather when we used it.  I will update should I have anything to add in the future.",

Next, it came time to take it down and put it in its tiny little bitty carry bag.  Come on, can't you make the carry bag bigger?  I tried and tried, cussed and cussed, and finally threw it in the back of my Tahoe.  When we got back to the rental house, I tried again, but no luck.  I gave up and decided to donate it to the rental house.<br /><br />The boy decided he might want it.  So he and his wife got it back in the bag after I gave up and went to get a cool refreshing adult beverage.<br /><br />It worked well for the day I needed it.  Now the kids have one.

I'd probably say for thin people, this bag would be fine but if you have an athletic or overweight build, it's going to feel too small for you.  I've actually been using this bag more as a quilt in a pinch.  It is comfortable in that respect for me.  The stuff sack it goes in is not that great.  It ripped after very limited use.  The straps for cinching the bag closed do not hold as tight as you may want them too.  The straps will slip back to a position where they're comfortable so it's hard to compress the bag down as much as you'd like.  If you're an ultralight backpacker, there are lighter bags out there that are of better quality for sure.  Granted, you're going to pay a lot more though.",

            "question": "title: Excellent Emergency Source for Vegetables With No Added Ingredients\ntext: Where I live it is important to have back up food sources.  Sometimes we get severe weather and that can mean an inability to go to the grocery store, no electricity, or sometimes snowed in for a while.  I always try to have some different foods on hand that are easy to fix for such times as that, but one thing I have not had is vegetables for long term storage, should we have to go through an extended time of roughing it.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS COLLECTION LIKE?<br />WHAT SIZE BUCKET?<br />First of all, it comes in a four gallon sized bucket which is square.  That means it will fit on the shelf more easily and be easier to stack.  This baby was SEALED tight.  It has a tab that you pull which starts a plastic strip coming off from around the entire rim of the bucket.  The size is 13 1/2 inches high and 10 inches square.<br /><br />HOW WAS THIS BUCKET TO OPEN?<br />I have to say that this bucket was VERY difficult to open.  If you are older, or have a weak grip, this might be very difficult to open- especially in an emergency.  Of course, being hungry might motivate you enough to push through, but honestly, I am pretty strong and this particular bucket was so hard to open I had to get pliers and then pull with all of my might many times to work it off of the bucket.<br /><br />WHAT IS THE BUCKET LIKE INSIDE?<br />Inside the rim is a rubberized seal.  I would assume that the way this was sealed that it would withstand reasonable water around it- perhaps not for a really long time, but enough to keep the contents dry for a bit should you need to be in the rain or have a flood in your storage area.  There is a little crunched up bunch of powder inside which I am thinking was at one time a moisture control tab, but I can not say for sure.<br /><br />There is a bit more space in the bucket so that you could keep other freeze dried pouches in here, or perhaps plastic dishes or other things you want to put in with it for saving space, such as vacuum sealed spices, or other mixes you might have accumulated or made.  It is important that they are sealed, however as you don't want to have bugs get into the bucket over time from just loosely bagged foods.  Also I would avoid grains in a bucket like this as they can still hatch bugs which will eat through vacuum sealed bags- ask me how I know..<br /><br />WHAT IS IN THE BUCKET?<br />This is where I was a bit disappointed.  The outside clearly lists what is in the bucket, but for the price, I expected to have a little better quality than this.  There are metallic bags in this bucket most of which are vacuum sealed.  Two of them are not, however.  One of them is onions, but the other was not even labeled.  It turned out to be potatoes, but there was not anything on the bag at all to indicate that it was potatoes.  I would have thought that it would be labeled and vacuum sealed for the onions and potatoes.  Perhaps there is a reason why they are not.<br /><br />HOW PRACTICAL IS THIS KIT?<br />This kit has 109 servings in it.  That is a lot, but the problem is that each package of vegetables is the entire contents of the bucket.  For instance, it might have 15 servings of peas in one pouch, but let's say you do not want to have peas all of the time.  Perhaps you have a quick emergency for a few days and then it is over.  The problem is that once you open the bag of peas, the shelf life goes down quickly.<br /><br />So, once you open a bag, you have to finish it in a reasonable amount of time and keep ti sealed in a jar perhaps for longer storage.  It will NOT last 20 years as advertised however once opened.<br /><br />HOW IS THIS KIT BEST USED?<br />This kit is best used as a 1 week supply for food.  A few weeks at best.  That means if you buy this kit, then you will have to plan on using what is inside all at once- at least each vegetable that you open.  That means you should buy multiple packs if you want to have a long term storage that you can rely on over an extended period.<br /><br />DRAWBACKS<br />I would have liked to see the pouches broken down in thirds or even halves.  That way if you open one, you still have another for future use, up to 20 years.  I also was not sure why the potatoes and onions were not vacuum sealed and why the potatoes are not labeled.  They are a part of the kit, so they should have been labeled like the rest of the bags in the bucket.<br /><br />QUALITY<br />The vegetables tasted good- they are freeze dried which means that you can eat them as a crunchy snack food without breaking your teeth as you would with dehydrated food.  You can also cook with them, but honestly they were so good as snacks that is how we enjoyed them.  It is important that you drink plenty of water when eating freeze dried foods, however.  We would always have them right out of the bag at our house which is the best way to have the most nutrients.<br /><br />I love that this has no added sugar or other ingredients like most &#34;survival&#34; food does.  It is just vegetables and that fits our family perfectly as we do not eat sugar or highly processed foods.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Although the bucket is very difficult to get into (at least this one was), the food inside is well protected from weather and elements.  The food is sealed in large bags of each type, so you need to use up what you open in a reasonable amount of time.  Not all of the bags were vacuum sealed and one was not marked, so I give this four stars for that.<br /><br />As for the purchase and having it handy, it is an excellent kit to have on hand, especially if you live in an area that is prone to severe weather.  I would reiterate that it would be best to have a collection of these handy as this one will only feed a small family for a short period of time.<br /><br />I will update with more information should I have anything else to report in the future.",

I was hopeful, because my Nathan water bottle holder doesn't have a place for my phone. But I'll stick with the Nathan for now. This one is just too bulky and not as user friendly. It does seem to fit my husband better than me, I guess because he has man hands. My iPhone 4 does fit inside the pocket, though there is a little room, so it slides around a bit.

The nylon fabric on this chair is quite thick when compared to the cheaper chairs that I purchased to use at my kids' sports events.  The main chair has a reclining feature and the foot stool/chair is made just as well.<br /><br />The concept for this chair is that you can lean back and put your feet up on the foot stool.  When necessary, the stool can be used as a separate chair.  They do work as intended as you can see from the pictures, what you see is what you get.<br /><br />What you can't tell from the pictures is that because of the thicker nylon and the fact that there are two chairs, this is a fairly heavy product.  The chairs are joined together with a clamping system, which means they aren't as easy to separate as a system that can clip the two together.  Also because of the two chairs, they are awkward to fold together and compress small enough to fit back into the bag easily.<br /><br />So the concept is quite good but when actually using it, you'll find that these chairs do require a little more work and have to deal with the extra weight...  that's on top of all the other stuff you're already carrying when you go to sports events or picnics.",

Let me say that it does the job and does it the same as Artic and a Yeti. Both are high priced and this Marky tumbler is not only identical but holds hot beverages the same. I do not use mine for cold stuff, although I had ice and soda and left it over night on the table after dinner and still had ice the next morning. I use this for coffee. Works excellent. I can pour it in in the morning and sip away through the day. I have a toddler and having a hot cup of coffee in one sitting is not gonna happen so this is awesome. It also fits great in the cup holder of the truck so I can take this on the go. Came with two lids, basic straw opening lid and a slider. I use the slider to help retain the heat in my coffee. I am super satisfied with this cup.<br />When I seen the price I said yeah I will review this because I could not help but want to know if it works like a higher priced item , it does and I just can't see why anyone pays more ( I guess for the name) this tumbler was perfect.<br />Don't forget that there are places that powder coat these and engrave them so save the money and buy this one and then get it customized!!! BPA free lids, stainless is perfect for on the go, no breaking if you drop it, easy to clean, safe .",

But I decided to buy it on a whim. I usually have very good experience with buying basic packets of pasta dishes. Some I have just let sit on my shelves for several years, and then when I made it it tastes fine. Some have had reduced flavor, but still edible. Then I have done some where I repackaged in mylar (no special preparation), and that boosted the freshness. So more or less this is reason why i have avoided the emergency containers. But, I have been adding various ingredients to my long term storage, and have been buying when on sale. This was on sale, and so I just decided to add one container on a whim. I like that it contains a few mylar pouches as opposed to opening the canister and it just being an open container of a pasta meal. For that, I really found it worth buying.",

Besides that it really did a good job on my knives and has a lot of great features packed into it.  The magnetic plates that hold the two diamond plates used for the sharpening are a great idea and allows for arrow head sharpening and assembly.  It also leaves you a nice little hidden storage area.  I'm not sure on this but I would hope that you can replace those when needed but it probably would be cheaper just to purchase a new one at this price.

Totally fun and unnecessary.. and why not! Living on 7th hole of a golf course.. I’ll let you in on a secret, shsss.. My teens/college kids grew up here- and love to play around on the groomed grounds after dark- usually a lot of silly cart-wheeling and ball hunting! Yep, it’s a real thing!! Ball collecting only to hit them frivolously off into to the darkness.. all bc, they cant see where they went to get them back! Troublemakers- I know! But, a bit of harmless fun they’ve grown up perfecting.. Only now, I’ve found a way to let them play with more of a purpose! GaMe On!! As we’re really about find out who truly has the better shot! (Before its all judged on a “feeling”..as you can tell they take their game very serious!)<br /><br />Hits like a golf ball, nothing wobbly or lopsided. Without activation it looks/feels in texture, weight, feel and sight just as a golfball should. One wouldn’t know these had magic powers.. something I do wish was marked by word or symbol, bc it’s too easy to mix up with regular balls- I’d hate to misplace or lose bc of this. *can easily mark with permanent marker to avoid losing- I highly suggest doing so! Fun unknowing surprise.. just be sure to reserve time on course at dawn/dusk to have glow be in full effect- Either that or come over for “night games” at our house!!<br /><br />Great option for those who have back yard putting green.. or even golf gadgets/mobile units one sets up to practice form and such in the in/outdoors of home- ball is easy to find if rolled into bush or under furniture. Great idea to use at the local putt-putt golf galleria.. we usually do those at night time to avoid the heat! Glow lasted well over 5min. bright enough to glow ground around it.. see photos above.

The inside is a soft fleece material. The zippers are heavy grade and zip well. The chest pocket is the only pocket on the garment. It is not large enough to accommodate most cellphones. The Tennessee logo is made of cloth and is embroidered onto the pullover. My husband is 6'2&#34; and weighs about 195 pounds. He wears mediums and larges in shirts. This fits him fine with a little bit of room so he could wear a layer underneath. The sleeve length is fine, too.

I love it’s not “the ugly black spare tire look that accidentally got left out in the living room..!!<br /><br />The ridged ball serves a purpose which is something some don’t know! This has “small ridges” (a few inches apart) that circumference the ball. These help keep a person in place when using (sort of like tread on a tire but, it’s not grabby!) I see this very beneficial for any who may need a little extra help ie. hindered with Injury, pregnant, elderly or, just need or lack natural balance..<br /><br />Although supplied with a foot pump- be prepared for this to take a lot of effort/time to inflate- the better part of an hour.. This has a thick outer surface to keep it from puncture or bursting- which is nice to give user peace of mind (it just has to inflate a lot!) *This has an internal air bladder in case exterior puncture takes place.. made to “break ones fall“ to the ground and let you down slower so to speak. Slower = 1.1 sec to deflate so it breaks up the impact if popped vs. hitting ground hard!! (trust me, it still can scare you but, 1.1 sec. makes all the difference!) **Bc of time to fill- we used an electric pump to make quicker work of the task in total 20min.. Those younger with more muscle may not find this as tedious. *Just note: this IS compatible with an electric pump and definitely worth getting it out for the job!!<br /><br />Bonus: includes Pilates ball! I am not skilled how to use 100%.. but, I found a few stretches this helps s much with and YouTube videos are perfect to show “how too” used properly..!!<br /><br />Overall, this is a solid yoga ball- it has the look/feel of quality and built in safety, Im impressed.

I buy from Augason Farms when on sale, and slowly build up my stock. Even when not on sale, I tend to find that this company often has the best prices. I normally dont have any issues with regular bags of beans just left in a storage cupboard, but I wanted to start adding in some emergency packaged supplies. Kind of a buy it and forget it. More as insurance than anything. Yet sometimes I find stuff from Augason that is less expensive than a similar product that isnt packaged for long term storage. I wouldnt say this fell into that category, but really close to it (when on sale).<br /><br />I like black beans (and lentils) because they are incredible versatile and can really bulk up a meal, and can easily be a meat (like beef crumbles) replacement if need be. Or can be swapped in a little to help reduce the cost of a meat based meal. I recommend experimenting with cooking with foods you plan to store so it isnt a complete mystery on what to do with it once the need arises. At the very least, get a few good solid easy recipes down, and then figure out ways to get creative. Definitely learn to make a loaf, burger, balls with beans (or lentils). Will definitely give a satisfying mouth feel if used to eating meat.<br /><br />If you think you will be eating a lot of beans in the future, might want to add it in on a regular basis now to let the body get used to beans (gas, cramps, etc from sudden increase in bean consumption)<br /><br />Plain, uncooked beans will need to be soaked and/or cooked for a long period of time to become soft and edible. The same as buying a bag of dry beans at the store.<br /><br />I may be a little more picky on my food source and country of origin etc when buying my day to day foods, but when it comes to emergency supplies, I am more concerned with simply having something to fill my gut. I am paying for calories, plain and simple. I am paying for a variety of calories. I am paying for calories that I can rely on (ie well packaged). I have no problem with Augason Farms products, and am happy to be adding to my reserves.",

It dissolves hard to clean substances like glues, grease, paints and inks. I've even used it successfully to repel spiders from my letterbox. And it smells great. (Not that you should sniff it too closely: it will make you sneeze and your eyes water.) I keep some in a couple of small 3 ounce spray bottles. It's great for recycling glass jars and other containers. To remove the labels, you can soak them in water, peel off the other layers, then spray them liberally with orange oil. Let it sink in for a few minutes and then scrub off under water with a suitable scrubber (e.g. stainless steel for glass, nylon for plastics).",

            "question": "title: EXACTLY What I Was Looking For When Talking Long Rural Walks\ntext: One of the most frustrating things for me is if I want to go for a long walk in a rural area and I have to have a phone near by.  I prefer to walk without a phone and such, but at times I can not escape the need to have a phone for an important phone call.  I really don't like a fanny pack, as it is really big, but was looking for something handier.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This stash belt is very thin.  It is deceiving, however.  The belt itself is a good quality stretchy elastic.  It is heavy duty but not so heavy that it is bulky.  There is a black clip in the back, and a slide to make the belt longer or shorter.  The pack itself is 2 inches by 9 inches.  However, it has a pleat in the top and bottom which make it bigger.<br /><br />There is a water resistant lining in the pack, a front zipper, and a very thin reflective strip on the front.  At full length, the belt measures 34 inches unstretched, and 41 inches stretched.  The shortest is 24 inches stretching to about 32 inches.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?<br />When using this, I can put my smart phone into the pack, a set of keys and a few cards.  I can also stick in a tissue or two folded small.  A huge set of keys will make it a bit tight, but a reasonable ring of keys with several keys on it should be fine.  The pack does stretch a little bit so that things will fit.<br /><br />As far as use, I found that this is very handy.  I have to stretch it a little tight so that it does not bobble around as I walk.  That is okay though, because it holds it in place.  Otherwise, the phone and things can make it sag a little bit.  Finding the right tightness takes a bit of trial and error.  I really appreciate having this as it makes it the closet to walking without anything that I have been able to get.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br /> I really like this stash belt.  It is handy, useful, and makes it so that I can go for long walks without bulky bags or packs.  Safe and with decent capacity, I can carry what I want to have with me yet feel free and lightweight at the same time.  With a range of sizes it will fit, many people would benefit from this, but if you are a big and tall man, it might be a bit tight.<br /><br />RATING<br />Five stars for this.  I really like it.  It is handy and easy to use.  I will update if I have anything else important to add in the future.",

When I received it I have to say that initially I was very impressed by everything that it came with and the quality of those items. The Dartboard itself is a better quality board than any that I used as a kid at home and even better than any I had used publicly. This kit would make a great gift to anyone wanting to  get back into the game of darts or anyone wanting to even up their game of darts.<br /><br />Now with all that said, I am not familiar with other brands of darts or boards but in my opinion this seems to be of great quality to me. It has everything you need to get started. Everything included is well made. It's easy to set up and hang, and the darts beat out the cheap plastic steel tip darts I used to play with back in the day. Overall I am impressed with this kit and have enjoyed it now for several months with zero issues. I hope that this was helpful.",

Quite some time ago, I was in a few car accidents (all someone else hitting my car) and I have a really difficult time finding chairs I can sit in without pain and frustration.  I almost didn't get this chair due to some frustrated reviews, but I am SO glad I did.<br /><br />HOW THIS COMES<br />This chair comes all in parts in a really nice compact case that zips shut.<br /><br />HOW TO ASSEMBLE<br />-First you just snap the shock corded poles into place.  You will have a chair frame.<br /><br />-Second you put the top of the chair back onto the upper poles and ease them on together.  It is a tight fit, but take your time.  It is worth it.<br /><br />-Third, lay the chair on its side with the back in place on the frame, and then put on the lowest bottom of the chair into the pole.  Press your body weight slightly on the upper pole facing you until it fits into the pocket on the lower end that remains.<br /><br />TIME TO ASSEMBLE?<br />This took me literally 5 minutes.<br /><br />COMFORT?<br />This chair is absolutely wonderful.  The angle that it is takes the weight off of the tail bone and allows the back to be cradled with support, but not too much that it hurts.  It also has the perfect height for my legs.<br /><br />NECK PILLOW<br />Even the neck pillow is perfect.  It hits my neck like a neck roll and helps me to stay comfortable when I want to put my head back for a bit.<br /><br />CAN HOLDER AND POCKET<br />There is a detachable can holder that clips on one side.  There is a pocket where I put glasses or a book on the other side.  It is big enough for a tablet.<br /><br />MY SIZE<br />I am about 5'7\" tall and am a size 16 misses US.  This chair is perfect for me. It is not too tight or upright.<br /><br />GETTING OUT OF THE CHAIR<br />The interesting part of this chair is that although it does not have arms on it, this chair is taut enough that I can easily press on the sides and get right out of the chair without a struggle.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This chair is FANTASTIC.  It is easy to put together (if you follow my instructions), comfortable and the perfect height (17 inches at the front lip) from the ground.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.

This 'towel' works out of the shower, and is light and compact enough at less than five and a half ounces and folded to a scant 7x5 inches to be negligible in a backpack. I am currently carrying mine with me in a gig bag for hot, sweaty performances.<br /><br />There are a few things that I truly like. One is the zipper pattern stitching around the entire towel. That seam reinforces the towel. The other is mine has already gone through two wash cycles without any issues. I had initial concerns about durability due to the thinness of this towel, but those have been assuaged. It holds up in actual use.<br /><br />What I love most, though, is how soft this is. The hanging hook is a nice feature, but frankly I do not use it. And the bleed free feature is moot since the towel I have is gray. I toss it in with colors and have not noticed any issue there. It has not faded one iota, so I am guessing that the no-bleed claim is valid.<br /><br />Basically, this is best for folks who camp or want a compact and lightweight towel that actually absorbs.

(trick is expelling the excess air prior to inserting!)<br /><br />Ordered in the rocky mtn. print.. it seemed a little less detailed than expected- but, comparing side-by-side to photo.. it’s just bc of large size photo- best viewed laid out flat I’d give it 4*. Overall size is more than adequate for x2 to either picnic or lay sleeping bags on. Ample room to totally engulf x1 adult with ease.. 5* for all size aspects..<br /><br />Surpassing all of the above expectations- I was surprised in amount of fill.. it was less than expected, especially if to bring added cushion and comfort for sleeping upon. I find this has solid quality, craftsmanship and all attention to detail to be sturdy + withstand wear/tear. Just know.. this won’t be a surplus of cushion on lumpy ground- unless it’s doubled over and used by a single person.. this I’d rate 3.5* for amount of fill or, lack of. Having said that- I do understand the reasoning to why it has the amount it does. So to be fair it was more of my own missed expectation.<br /><br />This has merit for giftability use- its one that will be around for a long time.. greater for campers, hikers, outdoor enthusiast, etc..

            "question": "title: Perfect For Picnics in the Mountains\ntext: I live in an area about equidistant from the beach and the mountains. I like going to the beach but I much prefer the mountains, particularly in the autumn when the leaves change. One of the simple pleasures in life is having a picnic in the mountains, and this particular beach blanket is a good accessory for those trips.<br /><br />This is not a blanket in the traditional sense. There is no padding, no fiber, no fringe. This is a very thin cover made of parachute nylon and it is very lightweight and thin. It will not provide any insulation from hard ground, nor will it provide much in the way of drying off after getting wet, but it is very water resistant and it will keep you from getting wet from wet ground unless you put it down on standing water.<br /><br />Because this is such a lightweight blanket it means that it can be caught up with a good gust of wind. Provision has been made for that. There are pockets on the corners and they can be filled with sand at the beach or with stones when farther away. There are also loops on the corners for securing with pegs. Unfortunately there are no pegs included with this blanket and that is the one thing I would suggest for improvement.<br /><br />I have a special use for this blanket. Along the Blue Ridge parkway there are picnic areas and my family and I like to go there for a nice picnic lunch. The blanket makes a perfect (although very large) tablecloth for the picnic table. When we’re done, it is very easy to clean and it packs up for the next trip with little effort.<br /><br />I love the fact that this blanket compacts down to a size smaller than a football. It folds up very neatly and compactly and it fits in a pretty blue nylon bag with a pull tie. At that size it is small enough to fit in a shoulder bag or in just about any space in the car when traveling.<br /><br />This is a very well-made blanket, too. I have found no issues with the stitching, the seams are straight and there are no nicks or cuts in the nylon material. I imagine that will change over years of use, but so far it still is pristine.<br /><br />I am very happy with this beach blanket. It serves me well on picnics in the mountains, which is really all I could ask for. It is made well, it’s plenty large, and there are some thoughtful features that went into it.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

            "question": "title: Better than the Average Lighting Kit\ntext: There are a number of lighting kits available for biking. Most of the ones I have used and seen have included a tail light and sometimes a headlight, and these lights are somewhat limited in the functions they have. This kit is a little more capable than most. It still has just two lights – a headlight and a tail light – but these lights are more advanced than most and they also come with a harness for mounting the headlight on a helmet.<br /><br />I’ll talk about each component separately.<br /><br />The headlight is the most impressive component in the whole kit. It is a rechargeable light with two very bright LEDs though it is very small, maybe 2”x1.5”. It has three brightness settings and on the brightest setting it is sufficient for lighting a room. By itself it is very lightweight. The weight comes from the rechargeable battery to which it connects, and oddly enough the battery is larger than the light itself. The battery can be charged up via AC power and the adapter is included in the kit. Note that this battery cannot be charged via USB.<br /><br />The tail light is bigger and is about the size of a silver dollar. It takes two AA batteries (not included in the kit). There are two buttons on it, one for LED and one for laser light. The laser light shines a stripe of red light on the ground on either side of the bike. I have not seen this feature before and I am learning how to use it to my advantage still. The LED function is another story entirely – the light has multiple modes, including a solid-shine and several flash cycles. This tail light has more modes than any others I have seen or used. Choose the cycle that makes you most visible from behind (or distinguishes you from the rest of your group). It comes with a plastic harness to which it simply clips into place once the harness is attached to the bike frame.<br /><br />Also included in the kit is a pair of rubber straps for attaching the tail light.<br /><br />This is a very nice kit and it offers a lot of features. The tail light is impressive in the number of modes it had and the headlight is far brighter than its size would suggest. This is a great kit for the serious biker and has almost everything you might want in a kit.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

Seals tight - I'm not using it to resist total immersion, just perspiration and rain, but it is totally waterproof and will protect your sensitive gear even if you dump the pack in the river.<br /><br />Material feels durable enough that I'm comfortable putting in in my pack without additional protection. Translucent top is very nice is allowing you to tell at a glance what is inside of it. No extra material or bits to take up space, this feels very secure in general.<br /><br />Even better, I was able to buy it \"used\" for only $25, which is a great price compared to the $39 they wanted new. The used one arrived in, from what I can tell, perfect condition.<br /><br />Caveats: My smartphone, which is about 5 7/8\" (~15mm) long, fits nicely in its sleeve, but you won't fit something too much longer in there. -Maybe- another .5\".<br /><br />The material feels a -little- soft.

It's much sturdier than I would anticipated. This is not your swimming pool float quality. Once it is inflated, you can see how sturdy and firm it is. I was able to set this up on my own for the most part. It does take a little bit of time to inflate. It took about 5 minutes to get it looking like a paddleboard, but it took at least another 5 minutes to get it to a PSI of 12. It took a little longer to get it up to 15 PSI which is the recommended minimum. My husband took over after my 5 minutes because I was getting tired! We will definitely want to invest in an electric pump. A manual pump is included and it's also recommended for deflating it as well. I tried to deflate it without the pump and it did release a lot of the air by just sitting there. But it wasn't enough to pack it back up so we used the pump again. It comes with a paddle that can be converted to the 2 types of paddles - kayak & paddleboard. The seat is easy to install with clips/D-Rings. There's a repair kit.

The whole thing is made of thick, bulky, cheap, SLIPPERY junk material that has no business being around horses. Not only is the lead too bulky and slick to *safely* hold on to (seriously, it's dangerous-- it'll slip through your hands and cause severe burns), but the darn halter is too slippery to stay even tied! I know how to tie a rope halter correctly (knot goes on the bottom/back, not top/front) and there's no WAY that should slip, never in my life had another halter slip like that even with a big ornery horse tied solid-- yet this joke of a halter I had to tighten up every few steps while leading a yearling pony! God's honest truth, every few steps. I hate this thing, viscerally, from deep down in my being I loathe it, with every fiber.<br /><br />This halter/lead is literally dangerous and an accident waiting to happen on several levels, and it shouldn't be on the market. It's garbage, and the absolute worst piece of equipment I've ever bought.

            "question": "title: LIghtweight, soft, attractive and gender neutral, what's not to like?\ntext: The Gaiam Yoga Duffle Bag or DUFFEL BAG, as the label says on the bag itself, is much more attractive in person than in the photos because the sensation of the soft and lightweight fabric enhances the appearance.  I was expecting it to have more pockets, so was surprised to see one inside that also houses a smaller zippered mesh compartment, one on the front of the outside just behind the section that is designed for holding a rolled up yoga mat which also has a small zippered exterior pocket, and one open pocket on both ends, both having a slightly elasticized upper edge.  There is really no hardware to weigh this down, just three light nylon zippers.  This is not designed to carry loads of heavy gear because the two handle straps are simply sewn into the fabric, not reinforced with anything other than the machine stitching, and there is nothing to protect the base of the bag from wear.  Because the fabric is lightweight and easy to clean, it is also crushable, so it is a good option to take with you for travel inside another suitcase for excess gear upon your return.  As for its intended purpose as a yoga bag, I find that by putting my mat inside a nylon bag I received with another yoga backpack, I can more easily slide it into the carrying spot in this bag.  The photos of this product appear very similar to the Gaiam Metro bag, which also is rather inviting.",

It's fun having them smash in and then pop out and it's fun for the ball retrievers who don't have to run all over the field since they don't go as far as a baseball.  I can't help thinking about bumble bees when I look at the [[ASIN:B00N0NGUCG SKLZ Impact Heavy Duty Plastic Baseballs (Pack of 12)]], but that's irrelevant.  With a solid black half and slotted yellow half, when my dog tried to grab one outside, she couldn't get it at first with her small mouth.  Once I showed her the slots, she was hooked and it was pretty funny to watch her go after the balls after they were hit.  Getting them out of her mouth quickly prevented destruction and I expect that the dozen balls will last a long time.  We have no major sluggers in this household, just casual players, but neighbors who showed an interest were as impressed as us.<br /><br />Just a hint -- my first reaction was to get into the bag of balls quickly, so I grabbed a knife to cut an opening like I do with bags of oranges or avocados.  Fortunately, I stopped before the slice because I suddenly remembered that the balls came in a net bag with a drawstring.  Don't make the mistake I almost did if you want to store the balls in a nice bag.  You can even wash them all with a hose while in the bag should they get muddy, then hang it to air dry as a whole.",

This table makes our campsite a bit more like the outdoor home we've come to expect when camping.  It's incredibly light and packs down into just over the size of a camping chair in its travel sleeve.  Set up is a breeze, just unfold the legs and roll out the slatted top over the horizontal trestle theb lock the end pieces into their tension grooves on either end, that's it!  Once assembled it remains a table until you take it apart, it self locks into place so it won't accidentally collapse or come undone.<br /><br />The overall height and length are perfect for a travel table.  We can move it around our campsite easily while already assembled to bring it closer to where we need it.  It is very sturdy and doesn't flex or distort when we're cutting vegetables or even running a two burner camping stove on it.  We throw our loaded cooler on top without worry, it can take the weight.  The size is large enough to sit around comfortably for a meal or card game but mainly we use it as a work/prep surface for cooking since it's a good standing height table.  This goes with us everywhere, it's very transportable and clean up is a breeze since it's all aluminum and simply wipes down before going back in it's travel sack.<br /><br />Very well designed table, the best I've ever seen for camping.  We bring it with us on just about every vacation since it's nice to have an outdoor table wherever we are with friends or family.  Doesn't rust, perfectly weatherproof and tough enough to get knocked around without being bent or broken.  This has changed the way we camp and I can't imagine going anywhere without it, you NEED this table! 10 stars.",

No silicone grips in case you were wondering/looking for that info.<br /><br />Is comfortable and sits well on my large head. I didn't expect these to stay in place, but they do a good job of not budging. As with most material headbands of this style, they do best when closer to forehead. BUT I have even worn them further back on my head and it stayed in place. Not sure how? lol.  When more forward on my head (and just touching forehead) I can move around all day and it stays totally in place.<br /><br />I often wear my hair up, and I like a little colorful flair. I also work hot jobs, and always wear a sweatband, so if I can combine my two needs then bonus. These wont really cut it for heavy sweat days (but not many do), but they are fine for light to moderate sweat, really just better than anticipated.<br /><br />The multi pack offers lots of pretty mottled colors. Individually wrapped. Stitching looks good. I assume a cotton AND spandex blend. They are comfortable, and feel kind of cool on my head. They add no heat or weight. BONUS? they wrap around the wrist nicely, without adding bulk or weight. So now I have a sweatband, headband, or HAIR TIE whenever I need it.

In my state, we do not have a helmet law, but I wear one anyway.  The photo I have shows the  visible damage to the helmet.  If I wasn't wearing the helmet, my injuries would have been worse.

I am 5’7” at about 200lbs and usually buy an L or XL and got these in an XL. I could have gotten them in an L and they would have fit maybe a hair better since the XL slips just a smidge, not bad though.<br /><br />They are nice and long so if you want to wear shoes with a heal you definitely can. Flat shoes they may actually drag on the ground if you are short, at 5’7” they are borderline when it comes to that. The material is definitely all synthetic and looks smooth which you can definitely get away in an office setting with, especially if you pair it with the right top in my eyes.<br /><br />The material is heavier and thicker and works well in colder times of the year in my opinion, you definitely don’t have to worry about these being super thin.

My chief complaint is there are no straps, which could have easily and cheaply been added, to hold the pistols in the pockets designated for them. If the bag is turned upside down for any reason the pistols can easily come out of the pocket they're stowed in and if you're carrying two as the bag is designed for, they can then bang into one another potentially causing damage to one or both. The divider will keep them from striking the magazines but not from hitting each other. The magazine pouches are, at least now while new, quite tight and hold my 10 and 12 round Sig Sauer P365 magazines tightly in place. Even vigorous shaking didn't dislodge them. The outside pocket had a good size gusset and expands to hold a box of 100 9mm rounds and my Uplula loader with room to spare. It also has a large velcro area for membership patches, flags, etc. The carry handles are comfortable. I wish there was a more secure way to hold your pistols in place and I plan on trying to modify the bag myself to achieve this. It should be fine for casual trips to the range just be careful when opening to ensure you don't drop a weapon.",

The craftsmanship is par with that of Nikon and Vortex and the glass, well in my opinion, it's actually slightly better than Nikon. If I had any criticisms it would be that the reticle’s height indicators on the rimfire model are a bit too small – they need to be beefed up a bit, and secondly, no parallax adjustment and no reticle illumination. But the knob modulations for both windage and height are uncharacteristically good for this segment as well as the glass and the finish. I paired mine with Winchester (Browning) Wildcat cause it matches the red accents – look and function in one. Add the lifetime warranty and bottom line is – you get a lot for your money.

            "question": "title: Difficult to build, and very much temporary\ntext: Let me start off by saying it IS functional and we had a blast playing with it at a family get-together once it was up. The problem, however, is that we found it really difficult to follow the directions. That, and I believe there is a design flaw that keeps it from standing very long. I'll get back to that in a moment.<br />For starters, it is pretty much impossible to assemble yourself. You need at least a second person to hold one side in place because nothing will stand until every part is finished (basically, the tension of the net and cords pull against each other and keeps it standing- if one part fails, the whole thing comes down). Second, the instructions are visual with very little printed wording so I found myself constantly staring at the diagram trying to decipher what, exactly, it was telling me to do in this step. I eventually found paragraphs of text in the instruction manual, but they were explaining the rules of volleyball... I'm wondering why they couldn't have spent some of that explaining the setup. Don't get me wrong, I've assembled things from visual instructions without any words before, and sometimes it is really intuitive and creative to do it that way. But this wasn't- it wasn't always clear we were holding the right piece or doing what they were describing to do in that step, and we ended up redoing some of it when we realized we had done it wrong.<br />The good news is that once it is assembled, it not only works great but I'm fairly confident we can put it up again quickly, now that I understand what needs to be done. I guess if you've built a similar net before, perhaps it would be easier to assemble the first time. This was a first time for us, so I guess take that into consideration.<br />Meanwhile, I found a very frustrating problem that I believe to be a design flaw:<br />The screw bolts have a plastic wing fastener on the other end. You heard me right- plastic. See the uploaded image. This is a metal bolt that needs to hold the tension of the ropes to the ground as well as one connection to the net on the other side. So basically, it is being tugged in both directions. It stayed up long enough for an afternoon, but the next day it had come crashing down, the plastic fastener yanked right off, taking the rest of the thing down like dominoes. I put it back up and tried twisting it on more carefully, and within 24 hours it came down again. I wanted it to stay up for the weekend, but it doesn't seem to want to stay up that long. I know it not supposed to be a permanent net, but it's even more temporary than I expected! I eventually used a little metal nut I found in the garage of an appropriate threading size to twist on next to the plastic wingnut and hold it in place, and that seemed to help... until one of the other plastic wingnuts gave out. Right now, as I'm writing this, it is down on the lawn as I'm not even going to attempt putting it back up until I find three more metal nuts to help keep the plastic ones in place.<br />In a nutshell: If you want to play Volleyball for an afternoon, it works well, but you'll need to familiarize yourself with the instructions first and I strongly recommend some metal reinforcements for the wingnuts if you want it to stay up for a weekend. I'd give it another star if those were made of metal instead of plastic.",

            "question": "title: Fantastic design!\ntext: Initial impressions:  I  bought a few of these to experiment with as I was more used to the HKS design with the twist knob.  I think this speedloader is ingeniously designed.  The reviewers that are griping about the difficulty of use?  I don't get it.  You literally put it upside down, seat your bullets, push and twist to lock into place.  When you expel your rounds you simply push the speedloader into place, when it hits the ejector star the rounds will release.  Viola!  Close your cylinder and you're reloaded for the next round of targets.  I just received these, so I'm reserving them at a 4 star with a potential updated review once I've used them a while.  My only concerns out of the package are the build material of plastic used in the locking &#34;mechanism&#34;.  This could potentially cause a longevity issue but I'm reserving judgement until I actually see it fail.  I had also hoped these would work with my LCR line of 38's, but they do not unfortunately.  I had read mixed reviews of guys using these speedloaders with the LCR brand.  I'm not sure how they're doing it.  I even tried taking off the grips to see if it would work.  Possibly it works with the .357 framed variety, but most certainly will not allow seating to unlock the bullets in the .38spl LCR revolvers.  It will not permit the speedloader to clear the frame.  They do work really well with J-Frames and my SP101, so I'm keeping them to use with those revolvers.  If they hold up, I'd buy these over the HKS line as the actual funciton is more intuitive when reloading and most certainly faster.",

The only thing that needs improvement is hard copy instructions should be included.<br /><br />As it is, the instructions that are in the product images (at the time of this review) are invaluable and will save a great deal of frustration. Specifically, if you look at steps 5 and 6 in that instruction photo you will see advice for using a hair dryer to expand the seal when you are trying to separate the edges for the first time.<br /><br />Since others have exhaustively described the physical characteristics and potential uses, I will stick with personal observations and a few notes that are easy to miss from the instructions. First, this pouch works as advertised. Second, it has a depth limitation - two meters - after which it is not guaranteed to be waterproof. If you plan to use this when diving heed that because if you go below the two meter limit you risk getting the contents of the pouch wet.<br /><br />For me this is perfect for harsh or wet environments and I doubt if I would ever need to use this to the limits I mentioned above. It' s also perfect for prepositioning emergency gear in a bugout or emergency kit.

Compound that dilemma with the fact that the potential color dye in the pool would no doubt be gross, embarrassing, and inconsiderate for my swimming companions.  What to do, I pondered...since, I have long hair almost to my butt and have found in the past that the standard one-size-fits-all swimming caps do not work for me and the cap literally slides right off my head from no doubt my excessive amount of hair in the swim cap.  Hmm...  Answer... I found that there was an swim cap option designed especially for people with long hair so I decided to give that product a try.  While, I have not used it yet, I tried the swim cap on and it fits snugly and securely so I tossed my hair/head from side to side and it stayed in place with no slippage whatsoever unlike the normal, standard hair swimming cap I &#34;tested&#34; in the past in this way (which consequentialy slipped right off my head - poof).  I am confident this long hair cap will work better than any predecessors I have tried and have suptendiously failed in the past.  Very happy with the purchase for my long hair and safeguard for hair color longevity and vibrancy.",

We needed to find her an alternative to her strands of lights woven through her hair and hat like light up circus (yes, I am serious) and this seemed to be just what we needed.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This little guy is really tiny.  It does not seem like it would do anything, but it does.  The front has a light on it that is narrow.  It has five settings.  One is patterned blinking, one is one and off blinking, another is constant on , another is fading on and off, and of course off.  There are two rubberized loops that you can fit onto your handlebars or stem of the seat if you like.<br /><br />RECHARGING<br />This took us quite some time to figure out.  FINALLY we figured it out.  The top cap pulls off and the light itself plugs into the USB port- there is not a USB looking receptacle.  It plugs into the USB port directly on your computer or outlet.  It took some time to recharge- but not more than a few hours.<br /><br />WARNING<br />BE CAREFUL WHEN PLUGGING THIS INTO USB PORTS ON COMPUTERS/LAPTOPS.  If you are not careful, you can break the port due to tight fit on some of them.<br /><br />IS IT BRIGHT?<br />This is surprisingly bright for how small it is.  It is nice to have this on the front of the bike to draw attention with blinking or fading on and off.  Having it on constantly helps too.  We think that it does a decent job of helping provide safety riding at night.  It beats the consternation that someone might feel with a moving christmas tree hair do coming at you not knowing WHAT to make of it.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For an easy to use bike light that is rechargeable, this is a nice choice.  It is small but provides decent light in several patterns to provide more safety when having to ride in the dark.  It is easy to recharge, but you have to work with the USB port carefully to avoid breaking it on computers.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />Five stars.

In the package are a pair of socks that come up to my mid-calf, a pair of peds, and a bandanna like \"tube.\" These items are okay but are not great. Although extra items are a nice touch, the hat is the best.",

When it arrived, I wasn't sure what it was because the box was big and heavy and I didn't remember ordering anything big and heavy. Alas, 100 packets of water does have some weight to it! The packets are small and hold 4 ounces of water. Each packet is about the size of a taco seasoning package for reference, maybe a little bigger. The size definitely has some advantages. You can easily slip a couple of packets into a waist bag (fanny pack) or other backpack without adding too much weight. They have a 5 year shelf life. The directions say to gently squeeze the packet before opening to make sure that it hasn't been punctured. The water tastes okay. I'm pretty picky about water. I dislike a lot of tap waters. Whenever I visit my Dad in Indiana, I bring my own bottled water. I found it to be palatable.

One thing I wanted was some spiral stakes to hold the canopy and tents into place.<br /><br />HOW THESE COME<br />These come with four stakes and a bar to turn then into place with (through the circle).<br /><br />DO THEY WORK?<br />So far these have worked pretty well.  The ground was not hard, however, so I am not sure what will happen if we continue in drought status and the ground gets really hard.<br /><br />DO THEY PULL OUT?<br />I had to remove them as my husband has to mow the lawn and keep things nice until it is time to set up camp.  They did not pull out in our trial run.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Hopefully these will work out later this summer when we set up our little tent city.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS so far.  I will update later in the summer when we try to use them again if anything changes.",

He's never been handled and is around 6 years old, so getting close to him is a slow, quiet, soft process.<br /><br />That process requires long, soft ropes and endless patience. These ropes are excellent for my process. The end with the handle loop is lightly weighted and the rest of the rope is very light and easy to maneuver.<br /><br /> It tosses true and straight from both ends and is well made. The length is good for desensitization work from a safe distance as the horse learns being touched won't be painful or dangerous. I'm really pleased.",

This is the perfect way to get them back into shape.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />There are no in depth instructions with this.  The idea is that you have five pads for fingers to press.  You put the thumb on the bottom pad for balance of pressure.  As you work your fingers, they get stronger.<br /><br />ARE THEY ADJUSTABLE?<br />There is a small metal disk on the bottom of each spring in each column.  To make it a bit harder to press, you turn the disk until it goes upward a bit. That makes it harder to press.<br /><br />DOES IT HELP?<br />I start some electric guitar lessons next week for a few weeks and I wanted to get my fingers back into shape quickly.  I have to say within just a few days of using this for a few sessions of 5 minutes each, my pinky and fourth fingers have grown much stronger which is my weakest areas.  I am even seeing it in my typing.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Quick to use, easy to take with you, this is a great way to strengthen fingers for playing guitar.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS. I love having this.  I am already seeing such a difference after just a few days.  I plan to keep using this and watching my chord abilities grow when playing guitar as well as other benefits like typing, etc.",

            "question": "title: Decent for lifting now and again\ntext: I use these while lifting - specifically while doing overhead lifts with about 70lb dumbbells, which for me is a lot. I do a little bit of a squat during the lift cycle. This is rarely an issue, but a few years ago I injured my knees and while they have almost fully healed, every once in a while they act up on me again and I will wear these as a preventative measure. Just that - nothing else, and for this purpose they work fine. Maybe it is mostly peace of mind, but I feel better knowing that I'm not straining myself without necessity, and they really do help take some of the pressure off those ligaments/tendons, I can feel it. However, the support is fairly minimal, so it works best as a preventative measure, rather than a protective one.<br /><br />I don't use them while hiking or running, so I can't speak to that at all.<br /><br />In terms of feel; well they aren't great, but they aren't bad either. They fit tightly but they don't cut of circulation. I feel very \"spring\" while wearing them, due to the elasticity, and I think if I were running or hiking it would make some but minimal difference in the energy needed to keep moving. They have two zig-zag beads of silicone-like gel that run along the upper, inner hem of the brace which prevents it from sliding down. This does actually work - but if you have leg hairs, you are going to feet the pinch. Putting the braces on is tricky - you are either going to have to do it before you put on your pants or while wearing shorts. So if you are hiking and wearing rolled-up nylon pants, it can be a bit tricky to manage it.<br /><br />In terms of fit; I am a 5'10\" male, 183, athletic build, inseam ~33\". The measurement of my thigh where this overlaps is about 21\" or so. I purchased the Medium that that suits me fine, I don't think I'd want to go up or down a size at all.<br /><br />All in all, would probably recommend them as a lightweight support.",

I'm buying two more to keep on hand so I can rotate cleaning the lids in the dishwater.  Unlike other people I haven't had any problems keeping the mouthpiece clean.  The paint on the cup - after several dishwasher washings - did start to come off.  So no more dishwasher for it.  I have dropped these bottles countless times, I would have had to replace so many keyboards and other electronics by now if it wasn't for the seal on this cup.  Makes a horrible metal sound when you (or the cat) knock it over but you'll pick it up and notice that not a drop of water has spilled.  It even seems to tighten close in either direction but underfill just a bit to fit the lid on top.  Overtime it will be a bit leaky when you first fill it but that will go away quickly.  I guess the other complaint about these is that they do not handle hot drinks.  If you've ever taken a sip of McDonald's coffee right after it's poured - and burnt yourself, you probably would want to buy a cup that lets some of that steam out and lets the coffee slowly cool.  This is NOT that cup.  I will fill it with ice and water about 10 pm, and unless I drink it all there will still be ice and water in the cup in the morning - and this is with no special insulation - just the metal cup.  I live alone so I'm the only one using these cups.  I also have terrible dry mouth problems (I'm on oxygen) - so I take one with me to every doctor's appointment and if you open the little handle you can hold the entire full cup with one finger or pinky.  So I can carry an o2 cannister, purse and cup of water at the same time.",

I have to go slowly and work up again to build up my body due to some issues and getting these strength bands is just the thing that I needed.<br /><br />WHAT ARE THESE STRENGTH BANDS LIKE?<br />FILA strength bands come in a pretty sturdy box (significant because you can store them in there if you like).  There are three bands that are color coded so it is easy to quickly identify their strength resistance when you need to grab one.  The purple is light, the blue is medium, and the gray is heavy resistance.  Along with the bands which each come individually wrapped are two paper fold outs.  One has tips and warnings, and the other has a few exercise ideas of what you can do with these bands.  I did notice that there is not a huge offensive smell with these bands either, so I wanted to point that out for anyone who might be concerned about that.<br /><br />HOW DO THESE BANDS PERFORM?<br />Because I have to build up slowly, I have only been able to work up to the light resistance band at this point.  At first the band seems as if it will not stretch that long as I am about 5ft 7in tall.  I was particularly interested in doing the exercises which use the foot and require the arms to stretch above the head extended all of the way up.  As I keep using the bands, they loosen up, however, and then they are perfect for whatever exercises that I want to use them for.<br /><br />MY IMPRESSIONS OF THIS PACKAGE<br />To be honest, although I love the bands so far, I am a bit disappointed in the lack of exercises ideas included in this kit.  I really would have like it if they included more ideas of what exercises to do with this band.  I do realize that it is possible to look these up on the internet to find more exercises, but I would have liked it to be included in the set.<br /><br />As for the bands, so far it is easy to hold and use, and I am finding my arms and shoulders are getting stronger which is just what I wanted.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Easy to hold and work with once they are broken in, these bands are a great way to do quick exercises to build strength.  Color coded for easy identification, the quality of the bands seems to be solid so far.  I only wish that more exercise ideas had been included in the box.<br /><br />If I could, I would give these four and a half stars, but I can't so I am giving them five stars with the statement that better insert included with more exercises would make this much nicer than it is.  But the bands themselves are great, so I plan to look up more exercises.",

SadIy I didn’t get what is depicted in the picture. For one the color is completely different. I got a clear bottle and not the beautiful blue shown in the picture. It is a 64oz water bottle and it does have the inspirational quotes on the side so that is good at least. But it is this dreary gray color instead and strangely not really a color option that seems to be available so not sure what I really got to be honest. It still holds water though and it should keep you nicely hydrated every day, if you can empty this every day.<br /><br />It has a wide opening which allows you to quickly fill it as well as add ice to it if you choose to. It has a flip top that has a secure lock so you can protect the opening you are drinking from, from dust, dirt, germs or whatever else really. You can use the straw it comes with or just remove it, totally up to you, personally I prefer to use it without it. It has a nice carrying handle that makes it easy to lug it along with you.<br /><br />It is BPA and toxin free which is important since you don't want to add toxins to your body slowly but surely through your water, trust me you will add it plenty of other ways, you don't have to add this one. This bottle comes in plenty of fun designs but also some muted single colors as well, so plenty for everyone to choose from.

            "question": "title: Smooth Operation; Bail Does not Close on Retrieve\ntext: Note: There are multiple products attached to this listing. I am specifically writing this review for the Size 85 spinning reel.<br /><br />One of my favorite pastimes is fishing, and my brothers and I have made a point of scheduling an annual gathering to go fishing. Usually, that means a saltwater trip, and when we have not rented a charter we have had to provide our own gear. I do have a large saltwater reel that has served me reasonably well but it is not particularly good (I’d call it sufficient). My experience with Quantum has been freshwater spinning reels, so I know it’s a decent brand but I hadn’t worked with their saltwater-ready reels at all before this one. This is a brute of a reel and is a smooth operator, though I have encountered what I consider to be a serious issue.<br /><br />Please note, there are several different sizes of this reel. If you are looking to do freshwater fishing in a quiet pond or lake, the 85 is a beast that is probably more reel than you need. Consider one of the other choices. However, for going after saltwater fish, either from a pier or from the shore, this is a good choice if you expect to catch anything of good size.<br /><br />This reel is solid and has a smooth retrieve and zero-reverse clutch that doesn’t give even a little bit. The drag is easy to set and seems to work very well, though I do wish it was a bit louder.<br /><br />I’ve encountered on issue with this reel and I think I have a defective one. The bail does not close by itself when I start cranking, I have to manually flip it myself to lock it back into retrieve mode. I cannot tell if I have a bad unit or if this is a design decision. Regardless, it is different and unexpected behavior than I have had with every other spinning reel, whether saltwater or freshwater. I plan to reach out to Quantum to determine if this is right or not. Though it doesn’t render the reel unusable, it does make it more work than it needs to be.<br /><br />I like this reel, but I hesitate to rate it higher because of the bail issue I am seeing. Once I contact Quantum and determine the reason, I will return here and provide an update. If the bail closed as expected, this would be an easy 5-star product.",

Overall, they are good to wear while fishing or boating.",

It was the perfect thing to get.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS COME?<br />This set of fans comes in a plastic liner that protects the fan unit and is housed inside of a cardboard box.<br /><br />HOW THIS FITS<br />This fits around the neck and the fans will bend into place to point at the face or neck as you want them to.<br /><br />HOW THIS TURNS ON<br />There is a tiny button on the right arm of this which you press three times for LOW MEDIUM AND HIGH and then one more time turns it off.<br /><br />RECHARGE<br />To recharge this comes with a cord, and you only have to recharge it for a couple of hours for a full charge.  A full charge lasts me about five hours for a mix of medium and low, although I used high for a few minutes in there too.  On low it lasts longer than that.<br /><br />IS IT COOLING?<br />I really like this.  On a hotter humid day, I found that this really added a nice breeze to my face after being hot from working around the house.  Sitting down to read a book or watch a movie is pretty nice.<br /><br />IS IT LOUD?<br />This is very quiet, although on high, I did have to turn up the TV a little bit- not much.<br /><br />LIGHT<br />The button has a blue light on it which does not turn off, so using this in the dark will make the blue light very obvious. To be honest, this is so quiet when it is on that the blue light helps me see if the button is accidentally pressed so it won't run down without me noticing it.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />I love this for hot days.  It works a long time on a charge, and the fans really do cool me off when I need it.  I am thrilled to have this, honestly.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  I like that this has a blue light so I can tell when it is turned on. The different speeds are great and even low is helpful on a warm day.  I will be very glad to have this during the summer especially on days when there is no a breeze since we do not have air conditioning.",

First off, I am a bit shy of gym’s and fitness centers right now, due to the ongoing situation in the world.  But that same situation has definitely caused me to pack some weight on!  I needed an answer, and I wanted something that was going to be solid to help me.  This treadmill is that answer.<br /><br />I don’t know much about treadmills, other than having used a few in my life, but I can say this stands out.  A few really important things caught my eye, that I will add pictures of.<br /><br />The first is a simple interface, everything is going touchscreen these days and I like buttons!  This has simple to hit and adjust buttons – I can feel what I want to hit without constantly having to look down, I just know how to quickly adjust incline or speed, and don’t need to risk tripping over my own feet.<br /><br />Additionally, I like the belt.  This may sound silly, but a lot of lower priced treadmills expose the belt on the sides or the back – this is full enclosed.  It feels safer if a dog, kid, or toy comes near the treadmill.<br /><br />It also won’t operate without the key, which is an awesome safety feature.<br /><br />The user interface is nice too – easy to see and explore the preset programs before you start your workout.<br /><br />If folds up nice, but I think I will end up using it too much to fold up.",

            "question": "title: Good value considering the many features and smart software, but there's a big problem...\ntext: Actually, I should say there are two problems, but I will concede only one of them is really a &#34;big&#34; problem. Let's start with the good:<br /><br />When I first got the Charge HR, I was really happy with it and made use of all of the tracking features because I am a data addict and I was keen on getting a step counter combined with an accurate heart rate monitor that also did a few other neat tricks like track sleep. I particularly liked that it was able to tell when I was doing other exercise other than walking. I bike a lot so the fact that I can at least tell me how much cardio I am doing even when I am not putting in steps is very helpful. I never did do an accuracy check to see if the mileage recorded the mileage actually walked, but it's good enough for civilian use at any rate. I eventually stopped using the food calorie and water counter because it didn't integrate with other health software like MyFitnessPal, and just relied on steps, sleep patterns, calories expended and stairs climbed, all of which this watch does well along with the companion software. (I prefered to use the phone app vs. the web app.)<br /><br />Then came my first disappointment. In addition to being pretty good at detecting when you are doing excercise automatically, you can also use it to manually track workouts to help you train and chart heart rate so you see how well you are pushing yourself, how long it takes to get yourself to peak HR, what your recovery cycle looks like, etc... afterwards, HOWEVER, there was no way for it just be in a mode where it would continuously show you your heart rate during a manual workout! This seemed crazy to me for a watch that was clearly designed to be an accurate HR monitor as well. When you are trying to use it as a real-time heart monitor this device totally fails because you need to fumble for the button or tap the screen repeatedly to get the heart rate which is a real distraction. It only will display one thing for several seconds. In some cases, like intense climbing while spinning, this is really not an option because you are using both hands for grip, so even if you configure it to use the single-tap to always show heart rate you can't really stop what you're doing to free a hand to do this. (Plus, this means a single tap always shows heart rate when you might want it to show you steps when not in explicitly set workout mode.) It would seem like this would be an obvious feature that could be made into a software update, but no such luck- at least not yet anyway.<br /><br />The second one, and arguably maybe what is the deal-breaker is that after about 6 months of use, the charging contacts on the underside of the watch will not make a good contact with the charger cable anymore. I clean the watch according to the instructions but still had to resort to brushing the contacts with an old toothbrush in order for the cable to make contact to charge. Sometimes I had a scrape them with a knife! Sometimes a little water on the toothbrush helped, but not always. In any case, every time I charge it it is more and more of an ordeal and I am expecting before it is a year old it simply will not charge anymore no matter what voodoo ritual I perform to make it work. Maybe I have a dud, but this seems like it's simply a design flaw. This is where using an induction charging system where no metal-on-metal contact is required would be a obvious fix, and I'd expect you'll see this charging approach in later generation watches. I am thinking maybe this is the sign to get a more full featured watch that has GPS (either built in or linked with a phone) or perhaps something more multifarious like an Apple Watch. (Shudder to think!) Of course I would lose all my fitbit data, so I guess if I am going to change it up, I should do it sooner rather than later!<br /><br />Anyway, that's the good, the bad, and the ugly on the Charge HR.",

Opening the pouch releases a chickeny aroma and everything is sort of mushy and definitely cooked and ready to eat. The texture is fine - the chicken chunks are edible and not rubbery at all. The carrots & peas are fine as well. The only issue was with some of the dumplings - these are made of biscuits instead of noodle based and some of them were actually a bit crunchy. I'm not sure if this was deliberate or if maybe I should have used a little more water than the directions suggest. There's not real broth with the cup and a half - it's more like a bowl of porridge. The flavor is good and I didn't need to add any salt to this at all. I would consider adding a couple of these to our Hurricane Emergency supply kit for sure.",

I would call it more of a slight sheen.<br /><br />The two mesh panels run the entire length of the outer legs and are only slightly see-through until you reach the pockets, which are lined, so your underwear will not be visible.<br /><br />The pockets are only 3 1/2\" wide and could not accommodate my XS Max, but may fit a smaller phone.<br /><br />II received these leggings in size medium, but the fit is unlike any size medium I have tried before. I am 5'3\", 116 lbs and wear a size small in bottoms, but I review size medium leggings all the time, and I am familiar with how it should fit my body.<br /><br />When a size medium runs small, it will fit me at the crotch, and when it runs true to size, there is some bunching of excess fabric.<br /><br />These do not even reach my crotch. I've never experienced that before. It reminded me of 60s style stretch pants with stirrups because the tight calves pulled the legs down and made them straight and taught. I was surprised by how snug the calves fit on my skinny legs.<br /><br />I tried to pull them up as I high as possible to achieve a more comfortable fit, but the waistband reached to my bra line. Since I received them in a larger size, I rated these higher because I don't know if I would experience the same issues in the correct size, so I am giving them the benefit of doubt. Had these fit the same way in size small I would rate it at 3 stars.<br /><br />I would recommend these for taller gals with long torsos and narrow calves.<br /><br />** If you found this review to be helpful at all, please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know.

Spend now, or spend even more later (and that is if food is available). Doesn't need to be emergency packed food. Buy extra of what you like to eat every single time you are at the store, shop sales, go frequently (don't wipe out shelves). If you are at a spot where you want to add greater variety to put into long term storage, then Augason tends to have quality products and better prices than other emergency brands. Look for their sales, shop often, build up your supplies.<br /><br />I like adding blueberries into the mix as it reconstitutes well, has good flavor and texture, and is still loaded with nutrients. Easy enough to stock up on rice and beans, harder to stock up on fruits and vegetables. Grow what you can, freeze or can what you can.. and buy what you can. Freeze dried is a very nice way to get good food that is still nutritious.<br /><br />Most  #10 (that reads, \"number ten\" not ten pound) cans will maintain freshness and quality for 10-25 years after production date. If opened, it will be shorter; depends on what you get. Blueberries in my experience are perfectly fine for a long time. Environmental factors will impact this. The cans are pest proof, can take a beating (even if dented should be fine as foods are freeze dried and have no moisture to sustain bacterial growth), can float if not opened, and are a standard size for stacking and uniformity (hence why weights will vary, and some stuff only fills a little of can).",

But often, it isn’t practical to pay a visit to a nearby gym- you need something that is easily accessible and that you can take with you, wherever you go, for a quick workout. A good option for your workout needs is Portable Pilates Bar Kit with Premium & Upgraded 30LB Thick Resistance Bands.<br /><br />Pulled from the package, this workout equipment is ready to use. All you need to do is attach the ends of the workout bar. At this point, you can use the foot loops to hold it down, then start exercising. There are several different ways you can use this simple piece of equipment. It can be used to tone different muscle groups depending on how it is used.<br /><br />You do get a fairly good amount of resistance from this workout bar, but there is no way to control the level of resistance. You have to take it the way it is, since there is no way to adjust it, that I can see. It seems to work fine for basic needs. Once you have used it for a while, I would guess that will no longer be sufficient- it will get too easy and you will likely need something with greater resistance. In other words, this cannot take the place of the sophisticated workout equipment in a well- stocked gym. But the best part about it is that, since it is so small and compact, you can use it whenever you need it.<br /><br />The best way to utilize the Portable Pilates Bar is to find different ways to do the exercises. I recommend going online and looking for different exercises so that you can workout different muscle groups. It’s a nice, simple piece of exercise equipment and it is useful for those who are on the go and need something to encourage exercise anytime, anyplace.",

            "question": "title: Kid friendly, and mother approved!\ntext: I have two wrestlers in my house. One in middle school and the other in high school. When they both expressed an interest, I immediately thought about the \"cauliflower ear\" that I have seen on some wrestlers. As a mother, one of the things that I worry about is my son's health, and in this case his ears. Investing in good ear protection is a must, so I set out to find the most protective headgear on the market. We purchased this same brand of headgear for my oldest son, and he has had absolutely no problems with it. According to my son, the Cliff Keen F5 Tornado Headgear is comfortable and he definitely feels protected. He says that he doesn't feel the impact of someone grabbing his head, and that it stays firmly in place. He finds that the straps on the top and under the chin are comfortable and keep the headgear in place without making it feel too restrictive. It also doesn't interfere with his hearing. He likes the way they look and how the ear portion is translucent and would allow him to see dirt. This headgear is easy to clean (usually he wipes them off with a Clorox wipe before wiping them off with a warm damp cloth and hanging them up to dry. The Velcro is sturdy and seems to be constructed to last a long time. Over all, I am satisfied with my purchase. For the money, I got a reliable product that gives me and my little wrestler peace of mind.",

I swing with one hand, but the longer grip is perfect for people who swing with both hands.<br /><br />This paddle is among the thicker and heavier paddles I've used. It's 16mm and weighs ~8.5 oz. One of the first things I noticed when using this is the large sweet spot. I didn't expect an elongated paddle to have such a large sweet spot, so it was a welcomed surprised.

I'm pretty much a size 20. I took my chance on this because sometimes things just don't fit right or feel right. I am SO glad that I got these- the sizing is perfect. I can tell it can stretch more (but hopefully wont need to). When they arrived, my initial thought was that they won't fit. But I put them on with ease. The polyester spandex blend is perfect. It is snug without being constricting. It is compressing without feeling like being encased like a sausage. My lower belly apron (flab) appreciates the additional support.<br /><br />High waist keeps the capris in place. I find that I do not need to hike them up. I can sit, bend, run around, and they aren't falling off. This is important because I am tall (5'10\", 300lbs), and sometimes the way clothes are made are meant for shorter frames, or so called high waists roll, etc.  So this pair of capris is rather perfect for me.<br /><br />Gusseted crotch lends to extra comfort, ease of movement, and not as much strain on the seams.<br /><br />The pockets are functional yet aren't noticeable when not in use. They lay flush. Surprisingly deep.<br /><br />The color gray, depending on lighting has more of a purple undertone. I like it a lot, even more so than the dull light gray I often see. I really like it paired with a black shirt.<br /><br />The material is thin enough to feel light and breathable, yet has plenty of coverage. I could make out my underwear line, but not my underwear. The mesh is not revealing; it looks more like a pattern.<br /><br />I find these to be very comfortable, and am pleased with the overall look, fit, and feel. As a plus sized person, it means a lot to find something that I feel good in. I am highly considering another pair or two in different colors.<br /><br />Again, very happy to have tried this, and now I have another brand I can count on.",

It's not very accurate and I can't watch it as I need to.nYpu have to ouch on the watch through options to get to it then it closes out after a few seconds. I need to watch my heartrate as needed and I can't do that with this watch and for that reason alone may have to return it. I have an issue called POTS and when I stand my blood doesn't go where it should and my heart works very hard to fix the issue which results in dizzy spells, exhaustion, high heart rate and mental clarity.<br />The other issue is how hard it is to take links out. The tool included broke fairly quickly so I had to buy a kit to continue.<br />Update: I wore the watch for a few days. After 2 days I had to charge it. On the 3rd day, the watch was dead before the end of the day. This is the last straw. I conclude that this watch just does not cut it. I hope this review helps.",

It is BPA-free and is food and dishwasher safe. There is a fork on one end with one of the tines that has a \"knife-like\" edge. There is a spoon on the other end. The center holes can be used to fasten this to a backpack using the reusable teather it comes packaged with.<br /><br />I got this because many times when I go on a staycation, I pack a cooler with yogurt and stuff for day travel. This is perfect for that. I ate with the spoon and fork fine but I could not cut anything of substance with the knife. I think $4.99 is reasonable for what this is but the knife-like edge is completely useless. A butter knife cuts better. However, the spoon and fork are good for any \"away-type\" eating such as camping, backpacking, or just a staycation with a cooler in tow.<br /><br />Even though the price is right, the reason I give this 3 stars is because the knife is useless and the thick plastic has a different mouth feel and pick-up ability. For instance, when I was eating yogurt with the spoon, I could not scrape the container as easily with the spoon end as I could with the [[ASIN:B07M8K5VQ8 Titanium Spork]]. This is good enough but neither their Titanium spork or this one is great.<br /><br />I attached two pictures.

It seems they really focused on this as others mentioned issues with packaging.<br /><br />The directions are better than most, but still not perfect. It does show you what to do but the explanations are missing depth. Overall I'd rate this as an intermediate level of expertise. A lot of that expertise is going to come from removing some of the equipment from the golf cart (versus the assembly of the seat to the golf cart).<br /><br />I was not thrilled with the thinner material (I purchased a seat for a previous golf cart that had a bit thicker steel and the seats were a bit more durable). The seats do need self tapping screws to install into the thin diamond plate steel but it does look good. The handle that comes with the seat seems to provide structural support for the thinner steel rather than convenience. Though it does provide a more secure look to the cart.<br /><br />IMPORTANT PART: The bigger issue I'm having now that it's all assembled is more and more cities are requiring rear seats to have seat belts. I had planned to install them as I did on my prior seat on my previous cart. That seat had bolt holes that seemed to plan for seat belts. This does not have holes for the belts and trying to find reasonable areas on the seat or cart aren't working. It seems like I'll be tapping some new holes to get those installed.<br /><br />Outside of that I still did rate this well as it is a good looking seat once on the cart. The instructions are solid overall. The packaging was also done well (2 boxes too). I would recommend this to others.",

These have no such problem - one or two tabs, leave it overnight, takes care of everything for you. Gets rid of the biofilm that may have built up over months of storage, helps ensure that even after you've used your cleaning kit to get rid of visible buildup, you don't have other harmful organic particles floating around in there.<br /><br />You can still use chlorine bleach on particularly tough cases, but one or two of these per year will do the trick on anything you usually use.<br /><br />Wouldn't recommend using this to preserve water, though - they are a bit too strong for that.

            "question": "title: Not usable for most applications\ntext: It’s a good concept, but the execution is poor for larger straps. If you store more than one fold of the sling the magnets aren’t powerful enough to hold on. When using a blue force sling it is basically useless. Regardless of where you try it, foregrip or the stock, it cannot hold the sling in place. A heavy duty rubber band is more effective than this at holding large straps.<br /><br />I also believe the company is using a common practice of identifying an American made product, while not outwardly saying Made in America. I understand that an American flag doesn’t always mean made here, but this style is commonly used for such purposes. Seeing as the company's profile is based out of China I would safely say this product is made there.<br /><br />Overall, I wouldn’t recommend this product for most. If your strap is very narrow and you would have at most one fold over it might work but be aware that if it rubs against something the magnets will let go. I would like to see the company use stronger magnets or possibly a small strip of Velcro to assist the magnets. In the meantime I will sew some Velcro to my existing one.",

I didn't want to have to keep wasting plastic water bottles so thought these would work better since we could just refill them.  They were hard to clean initially since neither of my 2 bottle brushes that I have would fit inside these to clean them.  I did follow the directions for boiling them and then cleaned them with hot water and soap.  The first day I used them in Rome when we went to the Colosseum, the clip on the first bottle broke.  That was the first time using that bottle.  I was using the clip to hang it on my bag and when I first took it off to give the kids some water, the clip completely broke off and I wasn't able to hang it on my bag anymore.  It was also difficult to clean during our trip since it has such a small opening and no brush or sponge will fit inside.  We weren't always at places where I had access to a stove to get boiling water going.  So we ended up not using them after the first couple of days since it wasn't really convenient.  I did like that when you are not using them, you can roll them up and use the attached silicone strap to keep them rolled up.  I really wanted to love these and had planned on using them a lot during our vacation but sadly that did not happen.  The idea is good but not the actual use.",

I wanted it more for protecting the piece rather than concealed carry, and for that it seems to be just fine. I have not had this very long and I haven't worked with it much but so far I am pleased with it.<br /><br />The holster is lightweight, made of Kydex which feels a lot like plastic but is more durable while not adding significant weight. It seems to be assembled well and the screws holding it together are tight. Nothing shifts or moves that shouldn't, and that's a good sign. So far, I have no complaints with the assembly.<br /><br />I am very especially pleased that it is made such that the trigger is completely concealed and inaccessible, so that you can't pull it out with your finger on the trigger which is a common mistake.<br /><br />The Glock for which it is designed fits perfectly, snapping in place nicely without requiring a lot of effort to put it in or pull it out, but still connecting tightly enough to keep it from falling out accidentally.<br /><br />The holster is low profile so it is well suited for concealed carry. It clips firmly to a belt and it is easy to conceal when properly equipped.<br /><br />I like this holster and so far I am pleased with it.

Me, I'm much more sedentary and have no inclinations toward even something as basic as step aerobics. Nope, I have a very different use for this exercise step, one that is important to me. My bathtub is on an 8\" riser making it unnecessarily harder to get in and out of. A physical therapist suggested I get an exercise step to make using the bathtub easier. That was an excellent idea and this step works well for that, with a few caveats.<br /><br />On the plus side, the step feels sturdy to stand on and doesn't slide around. The extra risers allow me to set it at the height that works best for me. A few minor things keep me from giving it a full five stars though. For one thing, this step is very long, making it a bit unwieldy in my smaller bathroom. For another thing there's no handle for easy lifting. Back in the day when I did work out in a gym, they would stack steps like these along a back wall when the aerobics classes were not in session. So the steps were being picked up and moved around a lot. A handle on the side would make that a little easier to do. Finally, some of the plastic under the step seems a bit cheap and brittle. I don't know how that will hold up under extended use. All in all though, this step is doing exactly what I needed it to do and for that I have to give it four stars.",

I put it in the car and told her you never know when it will come in handy.  Little did we know, it would be a few hours later that we would find out how handy it was!<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS UMBRELLA LIKE?<br />This umbrella is well packaged.  It comes with a nylon sleeve.  This nylon sleeve slips into a faux leather sleeve for extra protection and that upscale executive look.  The umbrella has a button that snaps it open along with the stem which gets longer too.  There are a LOT of ribs in the umbrella and it is black fabric which is thicker than many of the thin ones you often see out there.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?<br />When we arrived at our destination, suddenly, it began POURING.  We had to park really far away, and we did not have a lot of rain protection.  I whipped my umbrella out of the back seat much to my daughter's horror.<br />\"WHAT ARE YOU DOING??  That is gonna RUIN that umbrella!!\"<br />I responded, \"Well, we will see if does what it claims\"<br /><br />I grabbed the umbrella on the stem above and below using both hands and we used it to walk to the building we were going to.  Believe it or not, that umbrella did not even flinch at the horrendously high winds and rain.  Even I was surprised.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Well, so far, I have tried this in very extreme conditions and it held up beautifully.

I didn't naturally trim down this past spring after putting on all the holiday weight last fall and winter.  I was 5' 11'' tall, with a 38'' waist, covered by a 44'' gut, and a 47'' chest. I have fairly broad shoulders but not very thick shoulders or biceps.  Out of the box, from chest down to my ankles this wetsuit fit me perfectly.  I just have just a very little extra room in the shoulders and biceps area.  The Neosport Xspan Neoprene is so unbelievably comfortable compared to the material in an H20 shorty, a Mares shorty, the comparable O'neil full wetsuit, and the Zoot Triathalon wetsuits that I tried on thanks to Amazon Prime. The extra room around my shoulders and biceps has made swimming for long distances much easier (in a harness in my 68 degree lap pool). There is no chafing at all.  I also wear a 20 Lb. Gold's Gym Weighted Vest over this wetsuit to counteract the flotation of the suit so I'm a little deeper in the water for a tougher workout - an hour long swim. The pounds are coming off and I am hoping my next wetsuit will be the XL size of this same wetsuit by the time it's too cold to swim in my pool in late November or December, unless I go to the XL in the thicker 5mm XSPAN Neoprene to keep swimming all winter.  I'll definitely keep this wetsuit for my heavier weight seasons, and the next one for my more trim size.  I also loved that the NeoSport accessories all fit perfectly; the Premium 5mm Hi Top Zipper Boots (11), the Premium 2mm Hi Top Socks (11), the Premium Neoprene 5mm 5-finger XL Gloves, and the Premium 5/3mm XXL Vented Bib Hood.",

Let's take a look.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This sleeping bag is really two bags zipped together.  There is a nice outer and inner layer which are slick yet soft enough to sleep in.  You can use them together or apart and in single bag style.  The zipper works well and seems to hold well at this point.<br /><br />HOW BIG IS THIS?<br />This is big enough to go onto our queen sized inflatable mattress for our tent and also the one that we use indoors.<br /><br />WHAT WILL I BE USING THIS FOR?<br />We only do camping on our yard for the most part during the summer months when it is hot and we don't want to sleep indoors.  Sometimes, I get tired of the sheet or light blanket sliding off the mattress, so having this bag will be great for those chilly nights that sometimes come after a hot day.<br /><br />Also, I plan to have this handy because of a situation where we have to be prepared to sleep overnight out of town due to someone we know with health issues who might need someone to stay with them for a while.  There is an inflatable mattress at the house and having this sleeping bag makes it easier to set up and take down quickly to get going with the day.<br /><br />IS THIS COMFORTABLE?<br />It is a sleeping bag.  If you have two people who have different sleeping issues- sprawling vs thrasing, for example, this could be frustrating.  If you have two sleepers who sleep relatively calmly, this is fine.  I did not find it uncomfortable for light sleeping.  I did have to be careful about lumps and wrinkles due to it being lightweight.  It was not too bad though.<br /><br />IS IT HARD TO PACK?<br />This can be packed as a double bag or single ones and rolled up using strap or belt for both or separately.  It is not difficult to roll up and compacts pretty well.  When I really work at it, I can get it pretty small for packing in the car.<br /><br />IS THIS WARM?<br />As I said, this is not what I would call a WARM bag.  It is warm enough for a summer or early fall sleep outside when the nights might reach down into the upper 40s or low 50s.  I would not use this for really cold snaps, or at least bring extra blankets or dress warmly if that is the case.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This bag is great if you need a quick sleeping arrangement for two people or to go on top of a queen sized inflatable mattress.  It is easy to set up and pack and can be broken down into two bags.  It is plenty warm for summer, but not for really cold nights.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This is good for my purposes, but if you plan to use this for heavy duty camping in cold weather, you might want to bring blankets, or pick another bag.",

            "question": "title: finicky and fragile\ntext: I've had this stove for twenty years.  I really like what I've done with the stove, and all the amazing exploits I've had with it might cause me to reminisce fondly of it, but the fact is it leaves a lot to be desired.  Yes, it worked to melt snow at extreme altitudes.  Yes it worked as nearly my entire kitchen on multi-week treks in the backcountry.  Yes, it survived 20 years and still works dependably, sort of.<br /><br />I can only remember being well and truly frustrated with it one time, on backcountry ski trip.  It was storming outside the tent, and I was at high altitude.  I only filled the bottle with about an inch and a half of fuel because it was only an overnighter.  The bloody thing would not stay lit.  After that, I bought a smaller bottle to avoid problems with a low fuel level.  I also bought a larger bottle for multi-week trips.<br /><br />This is a stove that rarely works at its best.  Most of the time it manages to work acceptably.  Some of the time it works poorly.  It was rare that it worked truly bad.<br /><br />I always used white gas in it.  It's fairly efficient so I never had an experience where I ran out of fuel, or if I did, it was inconsequential because it was on the last day or something.  I'd be more concerned with running out of isobutane with one of those systems.<br /><br />This stove system is both finnicky and fragile.  It really works well if the stove is in just the right condition, with the bottle filled just the right amount, the stove level, the bottle at the proper angle for the pick-up tube, and at the right pressure.<br /><br />Despite the stove itself being very tough, the plastic bottle valve doesn't stand up.  The replacements are expensive, and the reviews for that replacement show a consensus that these things have problems.  I would say the reviews for those replacement pumps are probably more accurate and unbiased than the ones for the stove.<br /><br />I have a MSR Reactor for a couple years now.  It simply blows the Whisperlite away in terms of melting snow or boiling water.  It's far simpler, almost stupid-proof, way faster, and practically just as light and compact when you factor the fuel bottle and pot.<br /><br />More recently, I acquired a Trangia alcohol stove.  As a minimalist with a preference for ultralight style, it was appealing.  I don't have extensive experience with it yet.  I bought it to simmer and cook, which the Whisperlite and Reactor don't do well at all.  While the Trangia would be slower to melt snow or boil water (the forte of the Reactor, and Whisperlite), I believe it would still do the job under practically all the conditions I'll encounter.  Alcohol is a far more appealing fuel to carry than white gas or isobutane.<br /><br />At this point, I have a broken bottle valve.  It works, but the plastic clips to retain the pump plunger are broken.  For less than the price of a replacement part, I acquired the Trangia stove that I will likely use for the next 20 years.  It's lighter, cleaner, easier to use, simmers nicely, and takes less space in the pack.",

            "question": "title: Decent soft flask, but difficult to close\ntext: I use this bottle with my Salomon 1L running vest. As soft flasks go, it is okay. I prefer the types of flasks which have a larger opening, as it makes it easier to clean, but the wide mouth really doesn't serve the kind of purpose to which it is typically put.<br /><br />The most significant issue is that it is very difficult to close - to secure the lid you have to apply significant twisting force to it and the bottle,, but the only surface you have to grab onto on the flask is the collar right under where the flask threads on, which is of course flexible. If you grab lower, then the squeezing pressure forces the water out the top of the flask. You can tighten it, but it takes several seconds and some technique, whereas on any other bottle it is maybe a second and practically zero effort. The collars on the official Salomon flasks (ASIN:  B07V7J8R8F) are approximately elliptical in shape and a little stiffer, so you can get a solid grip, and the caps go on as easy as any other bottle.<br /><br />The second issue is how it fits into the vest. In a Salomon vest, the circular lid doesn't really fit well - it protrudes awkwardly (in terms of how it feels and how it looks) from the top of the sleeve, and it only gets more awkward as the water in the flask decreases. It fits, but not as well as the official Salomon flasks, which have that oblong collar and narrow cap, which has no such issue.<br /><br />So this is okay for a generic soft flask, if you want to keep it in your pocket or bag and collapse it when it is empty. Much more convenient than hard plastic bottles for that purpose. However, for a running vest, try the Salomons or flasks of a similar design instead.",

If you prefer a more brief summary, please see section marked THE BOTTOM LINE<br />----------------------------<br />When it comes to summer time and even Spring or Fall, my family loves to go for hikes.  Sometimes it involves overnights.  The talk of the family has been to want to bring a backpack along with tent and sleeping arrangements on an overnight hike in some great land around some lakes.  I knew that our usual backpacks would not suffice, so when I saw this, I thought it would be perfect.  Let's see how this measures up to what we need.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS BACKPACK LIKE?<br />The backpack has a very thick woven black fabric that is more like what you would find in a heavy jacket.  It is not thin nylon that is sometimes found in backpacks.  The black fabric is rugged.  There is a sizeable gusset (10 inches) in the bottom which can be retracted with adjustable straps.  These straps can hold a bedroll, small personal tent, or other similar things. The straps are pretty long so I am thinking the capacity is quite adaptable.  That means you can pack a small personal tent AND bedroll or portable small cot (we have one that would fit perfectly here).<br /><br />SIDE POCKETS<br />There are two small net pockets which can hold water bottles or similar things, and also side long zipped pockets which have cords on them for easy quick access.  The zipped pockets are angled, but they measure 9 inches tall at widest point.  The highest point is 10 inches.<br /><br />ADJUSTABLE STRAPS<br />There are quite a few pair of adjustable straps:<br />- under backpack<br />-upper sides<br />-small circular straps at upper edge of back pocket<br />-from backpack to top of shoulder straps on the front (possibly can hold small roll of some sort)<br />-center of each shoulder strap to hook and hold backpack in place<br />-on padded waist belt to hold in place<br />-at base of padded waist belt to hold backpack to waistband for security<br />-in between shoulder straps in loop form to hang backpack from<br /><br />BACK CENTER COMPARTMENT<br />This pocket has a tough handle on it so that you can lift the pack out when it is zipped.  Inside there are three pocket compartments- two netted and one nylon.  Compartment is 11 inches high, and pockets are- nylon: 7 1/2 high and nylon are 6 inches high and 5 inches wide each.  The compartment itself is a little over 10 inches wide.  The entire compartment has a double two way zipper which means that you can open it down each side or the entire way by sliding both heads to one side.<br /><br />TOP BACK COMPARTMENT<br />This compartment is at the top of the back.  It is about 9 x 9 approximately.  This pocket has a place with a strap and a plastic/nylon hook so you can hang keys from it if you need to.  The gusseting in the pocket allows bulky items to be put in this pocket.  It is not too deep or too shallow to be practical.<br /><br />PADDING AND SHOULDER STRAPS/HARNESS<br />The padding on this is great.  The back itself is reinforced and very stiff, yet comfortable.  It has plenty of padding on it for comfort while walking with a loaded pack.  The straps have great padding on them as well.  There is plenty of padding on the waist belt as well, with extra padding on the small of the back for comfort and ease of walking with support.<br /><br />MAIN COMPARTMENT<br />This compartment is very deep and only has an elasticized pleated pocket in it which is on the reinforced back panel (the one that goes on your back when wearing the backpack).  The entire compartment is approimately 22 inches in depth.  The elasticized pocket inside is about 10 inches high.  Width of back panel is about 12 inches.  The compartment can extend up to 12 inches out if packed fully.  There is another hook in this compartment to hang keys from etc.<br /><br />WATER BAG<br />If you want to carry a water bag in the backpack, it would fit in here, and there is a little hole that you can slip the tube through for drinking.  We do not use a water bag at this point so I can not comment on the usefulness of this feature.<br /><br />WORKMANSHIP<br />This backpack seems to be made in top quality workmanship.  The sewing is great, no loose threads, and all of the bindings and zippers seem to be in very well with no gaps or missed stitches.<br /><br />OUR EXPERIENCE WITH THIS BACKPACK<br />So far, we have just had all day hikes with this- no bedroll or personal tent yet as it has been way too snowy and cold so far.  However, as a backpack in general, we have packed this thing up well.  I also did take it to a large fiber festival which required me to slip things rolled up into the straps and also to pack the backpack pretty well.  It was easy to walk in and comfortable as well.  I spent almost an entire day with it and it did not make me all stiff at the end of the day like some packs will do.<br /><br />UPDATES<br />I will be updating this as we have a chance to use it over the summer for camping and serious overnight hiking as well.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Made with excellent workmanship, tough fabric, and well thought out, this backpack is great for hiking, even if a personal tent and/or bedroll or cot is desired to carry with you on a trek.  Use of water pack is possible with this backpack although we have not used it in that capacity as of yet.  The padding is comfortable and supportive and the backpack itself is easy to pack and carry if you are careful how you set it up for most balance and comfort as with any backpack.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />This is five stars.  It seems like it will meet our needs perfectly and I will update when I have more experiences to add to this review if applicable.",

I am a trained marksman and airsoft pistols are never super accurate anyway but at 75 feet it's only consistent with a brand new CO2 cartridge.  However that 75 feet is not needed for most airsoft pistols anyway it's just a recommendation.  Luckily I prefer a smaller target but a lot of people will not like this due to it's size.",

This is incredibly easy to do, if a little time consuming, I did play with the fit/positioning a little, but overall it took me about 30 minutes to get this set-up the way I wanted it. I have a exercise bike, with a full seat, not the bicycle looking one; this fit right on the center console (it blocked my view of the console, which is fine seeing as how the battery has been dead for months) and I used the two straps to loop it tightly around/over the handle bars.<br /><br />The one bad thing about it, has nothing to do with the product itself....my exercise bike wobbles a little, especially at fast pace, and since this is tied right to the bike, the laptop then wobbles. I obviously don't do major computing while exercising, so this didn't bother me too much. My typical internet use while on the bike is netflix or facebook, if I happen to be reading something I just zoom the browser to make reading easier.<br /><br />Already recommended this to a few friends who also love it!",

The weight with the water is fine. It's not too much because the plastic bottle is slim and conforms to the palm, but after it's been drunk a bit the sloshing inside gets kind of annoying.

We are both dive certified and snorkel whenever we get the opportunity to do a fun beach vacation, so I thought this mask would be great. It felt a bit awkward  to use when you are used to a normal snorkel. It made me feel a bit claustrophobic. I also couldn't see as clearly as my regular snorkeling glasses.

Your mat must be rolled tightly to fit, but you want a snug fit so that the mat won’t slide out of the carrier when you’re headed to yoga class.

Very nice package and excellent price.  I'm thrilled with this case. My biggest problem is dropping my phone and this rubber bumper around the edge is perfect for protecting it. The bumper extends enough on front and back to protect the screen.  There's also a bumper around the light and the camera lens.

People that have very little chance of drinking safe water can now safeguard that very important aspect by having access to a product such as this one.<br />Found out that to make it a little better the first time one takes a life giving swallow, is is best to let the filter rest in water for a couple of hours, then dispense properly (thirsty soil, indoor plant, etc.), and get ready to enjoy water from the faucet that did not need to be boiled to drink after, and perhaps a few cubes of ice to go with that? Just by the innovation alone, however simple the idea might seem now, it gets high marks for it works to allow anyone to drink better water for a change. Amazon, can not say enough so I will just say thanks for delivering this rather efficient blue color filter bottle right before summer, which seems to be the perfect season for water drinking, not to disrespect Winter, Fall and Spring, of course when it comes to proper hydration.

I have given poles as gifts and was happy this pair was not one such set or I would have been embarrassed.<br />I had set the poles at home, to my desired length. At the lake, before I could even take a step, one kept collapsing at the bottom. I did not trek of road, due to this. I fixed the poles again and hoped they would stay but the bottom of the pole seems very flimsy. I decided to walk to road around the lake....cautiously, I have had a double knee replacement so I rely on the poles a bit more than I used to. The pole stayed fixed to my adjustment but the shock nechanism broke in one of the handles.<br />I have them and as I'm seldom at my mothers, and do not have the time to mess around with sending them back, I will keep them but I cannot recommend them at all and I am baffled by the high rating.<br />I know walking and trekking poles and these are awful.

The nuts were somewhat hard to hold in place while screwing the bolts since they had a plastic gastket. I used two wrenches---one to hold the nut and one to screw-in the bolt. One of the holes was slightly misaligned, but  loosening and adjusting allowed the bolt to go in easily. Standing up the table after assembly was slightly tricky. I did it by myself and found that if I put it on the side, I was able to stand it upright w/o help. Changing the table from vertical to horizontal requires that I pull the legs out slightly, else they get stuck trying to go the wrong direction. The table top had a few small blemishes, but nothing that affects play. The wheels roll well, but don't always swivel easily; but, a bit of pushing in the right spot gets them moving.

On the side it has some motivational time markers to keep you on track for your water / fluid intake. This should keep you nicely hydrated every day, if you can empty this every day. I admit drinking that much water is quite a bit and I personally prefer mine flavored in some way, either making tea out of it or something else really.<br /><br />It has a wide opening which allows you to quickly fill it as well as add ice to it if you choose to. That also makes it easier to clean it. It has a flip top that has a secure lock so you can protect the opening you are drinking from, from dust, dirt, germs or whatever else really. You can use the straw it comes with or just remove it, totally up to you, personally I prefer to use it without it. It has a nice carrying handle that makes it easy to lug it along with you.<br /><br />It is BPA and toxin free which is important since you don't want to add toxins to your body slowly but surely through your water, trust me you will add it plenty of other ways, you don't have to add this one.

As others have said, the texture on it is a bit rough at first, but that's just a matter of building up the callouses, or you can wrap it in athletic tape instead.<br /><br />As for grip difficulty: I ordered the #1, which has a 140lb pull, and found that I can't close it all the way, there is about 1/2&#34; (13mm) gap. I'm pretty strong, but not really a lifter or anything. For reference, I had a pair of inexpensive grippers like these: [[ASIN:B0006GCBL4 Gripmaster 14003-BLK Hand Exerciser Black, Heavy Tension (9-Pounds per Finger)]] and could do sets of 100+ easily, and a set of those cheap grippers with the contoured, black plastic handles and chrome coil on top, and could do sets of sixty or seventy on those. I'm going to keep the #1, but I'm also ordering a CoC Trainer, which has a 100lb pull, so I can work up to it. That's what I'd recommend for anyone who is fit but just starting grip training in earnest.<br /><br />EDIT: Okay, so I ordered the Training model and used that for a few weeks. I could close that one with some effort, and quickly built my way up to sets of twelve. Now I can do sets of about three on the #1. Once I can hit sets of about twenty on this one, I'll move up.",

            "question": "title: About as easy and effective as you could ask for\ntext: I use this foam in a Pelican case which holds sensitive electronic equipment, the sort which is rectangular in size. I've tried many other kinds of foam - stiffer foam which doesn't yield easily, softer foam which does, but nothing beats the cubes for usability. I used razors, art knives, rulers and extreme care, but it in the end the shapes always came out ragged, rough, and far from square. I doubt I could manage a really clean job without an actual laser cutter.<br /><br />This bypassed the need for all of that. Basically, the foam pad comes pre-cut, except for a very thin layer of foam in the very middle of the pad. It is a simple matter to pluck out the cubes - really, the little square columns of foam - in the approximate shape of what you want to store in the case. I haven't had any issues with too many cubes coming out at once, if you use even the slightest care, you can be sure that you are removing only exactly what you need to. Each column is about 1/4\" square I believe.<br /><br />The set comes with an undulating top insert, and a solid bottom insert, as well as two pluckable cube inserts for the middle.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this as the replacement foam for the Pelican case over alternatives. It might not be as good as inserts which have been custom-shaped to components, but it is about as close as you can get.",

It's boiled water in no time and has cooked up our meals without issue.

I live on the east coast (read: ice coast) so its imperative to have sharp edges if youre skiing anything other than park. Actually even in the park. Now as far as these types of tools go, it works. Its nothing special. It doesn't change the bevel of your ski and just does a standard edge. Definitely takes a bit of pressure and a few good strokes to get the edge sharpened well, but it will get the job done and doesn't mess with your base! I did notice that if youre not really careful, it can slip off the metal edge and then you'll be running your hand down the freshly sharpened edge instead, so might be a good idea to wear some protective gloves just in case!

The original pulls were plastic &#34;snap-on&#34; type, and they pulled out the first time I tried to use them.  Saw these, and took a chance.<br /><br />VERY happy I did!  These are the perfect size, very strong, and work perfectly.  If you've never worn compression stockings, you may not realize how strong the compression is.  These socks were rated at 40-50mmHg compression, so one of the highest ratings.  That means that it takes a LOT of effort/force to get the zipper up, and for someone like me (not young, not lithe, not flexible, not skinny) having some sort of help is necessary.  With these, I can use one hand to hold the two sides of the zipper together, and use the pull to work the zipper up.  The textured pull is non-slip, so even if my hands are a little damp, these are fine.  Whew!  These helped make what could have been a two-person job into a one-person effort, and I'm able to don the socks in less than 10 minutes.<br /><br />The cord is surprisingly strong, and so far, I've had no issues at all with the textured plastic &#34;pull&#34; part popping off.

            "question": "title: Amazing improvement!\ntext: Two months ago, I had a custom saddle built on an existing 50 year old mesquite tree. (I found the tree in Mexico in perfect condition) This has been an amazing process and the saddle is 90% perfect. My issue was the new stirrups and leather fenders....so stiff and that equates to knee and ankle pain trying to break everything in over time.<br /><br />These stirrup turners were EXACTLY what I needed. Holy cow! Immediate comfort and correct placement. They do add length so you definitely need to adjust your stirrups. I ended up going up three holes for proper leg placement after adding these. Fortunately, my saddle maker measured my short legs and added extra holes to compensate.<br /><br />The addition of these turners means I can mount safely from anywhere and instantly find my right stirrup without looking. The stirrups stay in the correct angle and are balanced even on rough, steep mountain trails. That's a big deal out in the Big Bend desert mountains of West Texas. Installation was quite simple and took just a few minutes. My only complaint is because these are so thick and stiff (they have to be) my ankles can take a beating after several hours on the trails. Even in tall boots. I've begun wrapping them in vet wrap just to add a bit of cushion and that has helped significantly. I'm coming in from hard, long rides without limping anymore because my stirrup placement is finally set up correctly.",

Drain off excess water (I snipped a corner of the pouch about 1/4\" to create a drain).  Then eat right out of the bag if you want.  It's the lack of having to have pots/pans/plates/etc that makes this interesting, I think.  And more expensive.<br /><br />It's only a good buy if it tastes good, and this tastes ... OK.  It's not like home-cooked eggs and bacon.  The texture is sort of spongy, and the bacon bits are more jerky like than crispy bacon.  But the flavors are quite good.  Not overly salty, tastes like eggs.<br /><br />The primary positives for this are the ease of packing for a hiking/camping adventure.  The packages weigh very little, and don't require you to pack other items normally needed for cooking/eating except a few forks/spoons, and a cup that can be used for measuring.  What's left when you're finished is a very light-weight pouch, again easily packed for disposal later.<br /><br />This IS pricey, though -- you're paying for the convenience of having a complete meal, including \"cooking\" and \"serving,\" self-contained in one easy-to-pack-and-dispose-of pouch.<br /><br />If you have the luxury of cooking equipment, there are tastier alternatives (I'm partial to the OvaEasy eggs -- great taste/texture, decent price).  But if you really need to \"pack light,\" this is a very good option for a tasty breakfast.",

There were pros and cons for each pack.  He decided to keep the [[ASIN:B010LAU5CG Hiking Cycling Backpack, Sunhiker Sports Outdoor Backpack Bag Running Camping Backpack Water Resistant Lightweight SMALL Daypack 25L M441 (Black)]]because it met his needs the best. We  ordered all packs in gray, green, or black. We returned the other 5 packs.

I decided to order those for myself in Pink and Purple.<br />All of the packs had a mesh pocket on each side of the pack for water bottles.  We tested them all with a Nalgene bottle and a bottle of water. All of the packs could easily hold the bottle of water.  Some were a very tight fit for the Nalgene bottles. All packs had a main compartment with one or two pockets in the front of the pack. The main compartments varied from 561 cubic inches to 1386 cubic inches.  3 of the packs were lightweight, foldable, and storable in their own pocket.<br />Here are my summaries of this pack:<br />1386 cubic inches<br />18” x 11” x 7”<br />7” extra large mesh pockets<br />Bottle holder covers about 6” of the bottle<br />Straps 2 1/2” wide<br />Waist strap extends to about 45”<br />Small pockets on each side of the waist strap. Sized to fit a set of keys. 4” x 3” x 1”<br />Pros:<br />- Fabric  felt very durable<br />- Pack was very sturdy and kept it’s shape due to back support panel<br />- Thick padding on back of pack<br />- Easy to adjust chest strap – up and down as well as tighten and loosen<br />- Whistle on chest strap buckle<br />- Adjustable waist strap<br />- Handle at top of pack for an additional way of carrying it<br />- Easy to adjust shoulder straps<br />- Shoulder straps were very padded and comfortable<br />- Side pockets are extra large mesh reinforced with fabric at sides and bottom<br />- 2 zippered front compartments<br />- Extra side support straps<br />- 4 extra loops on outside of pack. 2 at bottom. 2 towards the top<br />- One large pocket inside the main compartment. Useful for notebook or laptop<br />Cons:<br />- None really<br />- Heavier pack than foldable packs<br /><br />This was a sturdy, roomy day pack, so my husband kept it.<br /><br />Update: June 2017. My husband uses this daily for work. It has held up very well except for the design on the front peeling almost immediately. He's still happy with this purchase despite the cosmetic issue. He said it's a great size and a great price for carrying his notebook laptop and things to/from work. I will post a pic.",

            "question": "title: surprisingly comfortable for a stool, nice bag-cooler-stool combo. Good details, worth the try\ntext: Worth the try. I hope it holds up, and I will update if I experience anything regarding that.<br /><br />I bought two, one for myself and one for my husband. We are heavy folks, and this is rated to 330 lbs (some color options are rated to 400 lbs). This in not person weight only, but it also takes in force of sitting down, as well as gear in the bag and on person.<br /><br />I like the variety of colors, the generous shoulder straps, the fairly comfortable bench seat (really quite nice for something that is part of a bag), the reflective strip, the spacious cooler, the zip pocket, water bottle holder, and the fact that the frame is nonobtrusive. It does not feel awkward at all to walk with this on as a backpack. Take note of the legs. Had this been a four-corner leg frame (like a chair), then the weight would likely push them into the ground. Instead, these are rounded and in one full piece, so the weight is distributed more evenly. Feel light, not at all heavy. Good detail.<br /><br />Funny thing, we actually have four of these. As mentioned, I bought one for my husband and myself. At the time, they are $25 each, and I thought that was a good price to take a chance with. And at the same time, my husband bought one for himself and for me. He made a point to add on some paracord zipper pulls. All together we have 3 camo packs, and one army green. He had already used his several times for hunting with no complaints. Not really sure if he used it as a bag or cooler, but he definitely used it as a stool. I haven't used mine yet other than to try it on. I will be keeping it in my car. I tend to go for hikes, and I like the option of having a bag-stool-cooler combo. Also, I like to have extra stuff in my car for emergencies and such. Also works nice for impromptu outdoor gatherings at friends houses. Got myself a seat no matter where I go. I'm a 2 is 1, 1 is none sort of thinker, so I plan to hold onto my 2nd one incase one breaks down or I simply want to use something other than camo  (I have a camo one and a green one for myself).",

It allows me to get some great photographs of the wildlife that seems to elude me when I am out there. This camera is small and compact, about the size of a small garden “brick” or a little bigger than my hand. It can be mounted with a strap or by a bracket, that can be screwed into a post or tree. This camera is easy to set up, simply add 12 AA batteries (not included) and you are good to go. It works on motion, so once the photo(s) are taken, you can view them on the monitor/display or connect the camera to your television or computer. My only criticism is that it snaps photos if it rains or is windy, not just when wildlife triggers it. I had 300 plus photos of basically nothing within a couple of hours, but at least those pictures it did capture were clear. This camera also has the ability to record HD quality video(s), which will probably appeal to hunters or game enthusiast. The quality of both the pictures and videos are decent. In conclusion, I would give this camera 4.5 stars. It is easy to set up and use, while capturing shots of my wildlife. I’d recommend it.",

            "question": "title: High quality, soft and warm fleece PJs but runs larger than expected\ntext: I ordered this for my cat Jake because putting on PJs or a shirt before bed is the only thing that keeps him quiet throughout the night. I always purchase a size small for him because an XS is usually too small. However, these are huge as can be seen from the last three photos. He is about 10 pounds and has a 12-13\" back. Therefore, an XXS or P would have probably fit him but not this small which is rated for a whippet or dog with an 18\" back.<br /><br />I only took off one point for the sizing because had I seen the size chart I would have known it would not have fit. However, the size chart on the Amazon site differs a bit from the sizing listed on the packaging. For example, according to the size chart on the packaging, a whippet can take between a S and M but on the Amazon site it says a small.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is a wonderful set of PJ's for indoor or outdoor wear.  They feel high quality, are warm, and made of soft fleece. It has a detachable hood that is affixed in place via snaps.  There is a hole at the center of the neckline (under the collar) for a leash to pass through.  There are jersey cuffs around all four paws to keep the leggings in place. Overall, this is a wonderful \"coat\" that is machine washable (but hang dry) and is reasonably priced at the current price of $19.21. Just be very careful of the sizing. The first photo shows the size chart on the packaging but there is also reasonable sizing recommendations on the Amazon site even if they do not match exactly with the packaging photo.",

            "question": "title: COLOR BLEEDS; just barely works as foot bath; best for outdoors or repurpose as ice bucket\ntext: I have another one of [[ASIN:B091GF5B46 these]] type foot baths and fell in love with it so much that I wanted another one.<br /><br />In the package is one carry pouch and one very small outdoor foot bath. The basin is fully collapsible and very small.  I unfolded it completely and made sure the edge of the basin was standing up.<br /><br />As can be seen by my photos, I actually used this indoors and it worked. I had to be careful not to let water flow over the edge. This is really for outdoor use only. To ensure the water stays inside, I only filled it several inches, enough to soak up to the base of my ankles.<br /><br />Once I was done, I rinsed the bath out. There was a water spot on my floor because the bottom of the basin gets wet when in the sink--another reason this should be used outdoors. Note that it takes many hours for this basin to dry. <br /><br />I was actually going to rate this 4 stars like I did my other one because it operates exactly the same.  However, the purple color of this bath bled all over my towels and I could not rinse the color out. It destroyed my towels.<br /><br />In summary, this foot bath is portable and does work as long as one is careful. However, this can be repurposed as an ice bucket with drinks for a picnic or to hold small beach toys for the kids. At the current price of $7.99, this is more expensive than the one I already own. It is not great but does somewhat serve the purpose it was intended for. What I love about this is that I do not have to carry a heavy pail to bathe my feet. Also, it folds down nicely. This would have received 4 stars from me if it were not for the color bleed. I cannot recommend this due to that issue and my recommendation would be to purchase this [[ASIN:B091GF5B46 one]] instead. Not only is that one cheaper but there is no color bleed.<br /><br />UPDATE: I washed the towels twice that this bucket bled on and the color DID NOT come out. This is such a BIG NEGATIVE. Even if using this outdoors, the color will bleed all over--one's clothes, the camper floor, the towels, etc.",

In other words I overdo it a bit.  Then I can get some sore legs.  Let's see how these worked out.<br /><br />WHAT ARE THESE LIKE?<br />These compression sleeves come in a plastic bag.  They slip on the legs and go from below the need to just above the ankle.  I should not say they SLIP on, because it is a bit of tug of war, but they do seem to fit well on me.  I would compare these to the tops of basketball or sports socks that are very firm and tight.  They are nylon and are thinner than some compression sleeves I have used in the past, but for summer that is actually a good thing.<br /><br />COLOR<br />These are a pretty mint green in color with dark grey stripes on them.<br /><br />CALF SIZE<br />My calf size is about 15 inches or a bit more depending on the day.  These fit me well and did not make me get into pain or anything.  The pair I am talking about are a size L.<br /><br />SHIN SPLINTS<br />I have had some shin splint issues, and these do help with that kind of pain.  They are especially good if you want to put some hot rub on the legs in between icing them down for shin splints.  There is sine relief wearing these if they are not too tight.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For support in walking or in treating shin splints, these are pretty nice.  There is a certain amount of tugging to get them on which could be difficult if you are dealing with back issues, but all in all they are pretty nice and perform well.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS.  They are nice and I like them.  I am not WOWed but they are solid performers.  They are a bit thin for long term use, in my opinion.",

If participating in water activities, I'd recommend packing large trash bags with you for keeping things dry if needed (the whole bag or just some of the bag's contents).<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Pretty spacious considering it's design! It fits my split fins, mask box, snorkel, dive boot bag, and towel chamois container with plenty of space to spare for beach towels, dry clothes, or snacks<br />-It comes with a carabiner which I've attached to my dive boot bag and plan on attaching it to the strap when walking around so I can fit more things in the main compartment.<br />-Zipper is big and easy to open and close.<br />-Strap appears to be well sewn into the mesh material<br />-Mesh material looks sturdy, just be careful not to run into something and rip it<br />-Mesh material is good for having to carry wet or damp things, and sand can escape so you don't take them home with you.<br />-Good price<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Bottom of bag is straight stitched (imagine fold the shorter side of the rectangular mesh material in half and stitch one edge together) and not round (round mesh material stitched to the shorter side of the rectangle to make a cylindrical shaped bag). Could have more space and better over all shape if it was cylindrical.<br />-Single flat pocket with no pleat fold to allow more storage space (think military cargo pants' pockets). Can insert small flat things in there with no problem unless the bag itself is pretty full then getting your hand in there to get something out will require rearranging the contents of the bag a bit.<br />-Only one strap with fixed length, not long enough to go across your chest nor is it padded.<br />-Strap could use a few more inches to give space for shoulder and bag bulk. You might have to rearrange or consider placement of things during packing so your stuff isn't digging into your back whilst carrying your bag to your destination.",

My husband was highly amused when I announced we had hot toddies, a roaring fire AND badminton awaiting us on the &#34;lido deck&#34;. The dogs perked right up and played with us - turns out, dogs are very handy for retrieving shuttle cocks from under recliners and end tables and hounds love to leap up to snatch the birdie midair as well, which makes keeping score impossible, what with the being doubled over laughing and arguing about which dog's mouth constitutes in or out of bounds.<br /><br />Bottom line - this was very easy to set up for one person, the racquets are nicely balanced and seem sturdy, the self supporting case/base survived five large Rhodesian Ridgeback dogs racing over and around it while we played, the poles survived being bashed into by the dogs and the two shuttle cocks flew well and even took a chewing without falling apart. This set probably isn't large enough for four adults, but two adults and two kids could play together just fine. My only issue was breaking it down - one off the poles didn't want to telescope properly on the first try, but I am not blaming the equipment since that may very well have been the result of our canine foolishness.",

Pulling the debris away from all of the areas that you do not want debris to be is critical for the life of everything from a firearm to an engine or anything else that requires the use of a cleaning kit like this. When you are finished using the kit clean everything up, put it away and you should have a tool kit that will last a long time. This is not a disposable or junk kit it is built to last just dont force it use common sense read instructions. I highly recommend this kit for anyone who is learning about firearms because it is simple to use.

The grips are nickel plated. The shafts are aluminum. The flights are a nice sparkling purple, silver and black coloration. You also get a second set that is black, white, grey with red Viper lettering. You also get add-a-grams, additional soft tips, nylon shafts, flight protectors and a wrench. There are no instructions. None of the add-a-grams have a weight listing. I even checked on the website and no instructions there either. I did find some information that indicates you would have to weight the entire put together dart to get the weight. Then if you want it more or less, you would need to swap out the barrel tip and weigh again. I noticed that the add a grams that are included have different lengths of the screw in and that might be the key!",

The tension only occurs when the band is stretch so not much resistance in the beginning of the movement. Other than that can't  complain better than no workout at all. Since covid close all gyms.",

These pockets are not flimsy.<br /><br />On the inside of the bag is a coating that allows for moisture resistance, and easy wipe if needed.

There is enough room in this bag for your yoga mat, even if your mat is slightly thicker than normal.  My gym mat is slightly thicker than a regular yoga mat, and it fits easily.

The textured base is perfect for keeping your child's riding foot in place. The size is just right, and I love that it will adjust as my granddaughter grows. She's really excited about it, and has had fun learning how to use it.<br />BAD: one of the handle tubes was too big for where it needed to be inserted into the frame. The whole scooter comes assembled, but broken down - you flip a lever to raise the long frame from the base, and you pull the handles out of an attached clip and then insert them into the metal tube (there is a photo on the product page of the collapsed scooter). I was totally confused, but checked and double-checked - one of the handles was both bigger than the other handle, and just too big too fit. SO...we had to laboriously file down the metal on the handle and the tube in order to even make it work. Even so, we didn't get it filed down enough to pull it back out (wrenching into place was really tough), so that side won't be able to collapse now. I do like the scooter, but when you need to fix a manufacturing flaw to get something to work, it's disappointing.",

You could pour some of your hot coffee into the cup so it could cool to drinking temperature while leaving the rest in the thermos to stay hot. With this bottle you need a separate cup.

We try to keep several such lanterns on hand for both camping and emergency use. This particular lantern was unexpectedly helpful in another scenario. One of Mom's sisters broke her ankle and was laid up in bed for a while. She couldn't get up to turn the room light off and on, so Mom loaned her this lantern. Kept on a bedside stand, it was easily accessible and more than bright enough for our invalid's needs. The sturdy rubber handle and the two metal hangers on top, which fold out of the way when not needed, will come in handy for actual camping.

I measured slightly under 113mm on the old spindle, so figured the 113mm UN55 would be the tiniest bit wide. In fact it was a tiny bit narrow, as the chainrings lined up slightly to the left of where they were. I adjusted the limit screw and tension on the front derailleur and the bike seems to work fine now. Not sure whether I should try a wider BB or what; I'm new to proper road bike mechanics. Also I didn't actually measure the new spindle to verify that it really is 113mm; I only noticed the discrepancy after I assembled the whole thing and I didn't want to back out all the parts just to measure....<br /><br />My UN55 was shipped from Bell's Bike Shop and it was missing the bolts.

My husband said can permanently screw them into place, but then we would lose the &#34;easy to transport&#34; feature. It wouldn't be too complicated to move them, they just wouldn't pack flat. The bean bags are filled with bean type filler but there's also something in there that crinkles a lot and reminds me of a cat toy. There were a lot of loose threads on the bags, but they seem to be made well. The instructions tell you how to play the game, but we couldn't find anything about the scoring other than the winner is the first person to get to 21 without going over.

You also know that you can either try to improvise some sort of ram-rod setup with a dowel and paper towel, or soak the whole setup in a 1:4 bleach water mix and dissolve any living organisms that way, permanently enchanting the pack with the smell and taste of pool water.<br /><br />This kit avoids that by giving you specific tools to scrub out the little tubes and the pack itself. I've tested it and found it to be very effective - I was able to get right down into all the corners with a decent scubbing, and then fill the bladder with a water and a few drops of chlorine bleach to kill off any remaining contaminants. It was much easier than any previous attempts I've made at cleaning. I can't speak to the effectiveness of the plastic drying rack - many of my hydration packs are old and only have 1\" diameter mouth at one end - but the rest of the tools make this kit worth buying, in my opinion.<br /><br />Would recommend.",

            "question": "title: What is that?\ntext: It's been a while now, but products coming out of China are starting to rival top quality manufacturing elsewhere. This scope is a clear sign of that. The coating is smooth with no blemishes, the glass is properly and evenly multi-coated, the reticle is straight, and knobs give you decent feedback on the turns, and the flaps have tastefully relieved SIG logo on the inside (so when you flip them open EVERYONE can see what you working with [as if it matters] but still cool). The throw lever had some blemishes on it and wasn’t screwed all the way in. The Box it comes in is very simplistic – a good thing – with minimal packaging and waste. Even the handkerchief is a nice quality and small, not like grandma’s undies that sometimes come with other scopes. I also dig on the reticle shape which reminds me of an orthodox cross – it’s not too thin or thick, just the way you’d like it (is what she said, yeah, I know…). Also, looking inside the scope with super high lumen light reveals, dare I say, precision – something unexpected at this cost level. I think Sig’s trying to introduce these in the best light possible so as to grab market share. Well, their marketing is your win (for now at least)<br />But wait, what’s that thing on the side, looks like scribbles or some kind – what IS that?! Meatballs with wafting smell coming off them? Frog eyes? Female crocodile cartoon eyes peeking just above the surface of the water… Let me get closer… Nah, it’s a STAG! With tiny little red beady eyes. And deformed horns. WHO thought of this logo?! Watsamadderwidu?! It’s possible the weirdest logo I’ve ever come across – it’s like slapping flame prints on a Bentley. Iiiish…<br />But then again, who cars, the paint doesn’t drive the car. So with that little minus, I’d say Sig’s again a winner. BTW, remember the old Nikon Buckmaster scopes? They were totally awesome maaaaaan… But then Nikon got out of the biz, so I’m wondering if there’s any connection between Sig’s Buckmasters and the Nikon Buckmaster series. Whatever the case, I highly recommend this scope. (and if you don’t like the logo, put tape over it!)",

(I gained about 10 pounds when I went through puberty and my doctor was always railing about it; when I got about fifteen I finally got sneaky and told the doctor I might lose some weight if I had a bike to ride with my friends. It worked! And I did lose the weight, eventually.) Anyway, no one back then ever thought of bike helmets. I rode my bike until I moved away from home in 1984 without every donning a helmet. Hubby and I bought bikes a few years ago and when we did ride them it was around the neighborhood and we didn't think of helmets then, either. After that, our two bikes stayed trapped in the back of our garage for a few years. Well, I retired this year and \"decanted\" my bike and pumped up the tires and got used to riding it again, and now that it's cool again would like to start riding it, but thought about this helmet thing. But I'd never used one.<br /><br />So I don't know thing one about bike helmets. This seems sturdy enough to cradle my head if I did take a header. It's made of some hard foam. It has an adjustable strap in the back (maybe all helmets have this) to make it fit snugly to my head, and out of the box the chin strap fit perfectly. But boy I didn't realize how snug a bike helmet has to fit. With it cupped on my head properly and with the chin strap on it practically makes me claustrophobic. I had to take it off after about five minutes. But this is not the bike helmet's fault.<br /><br />I would say this is a nice standard bike helmet. It's plain black, but If I want to jazz it up I could put on stickers or paint it. I would say it is a good buy. Someone else who has worn these things for years will be able to tell you more.",

But, if you are looking for a warm or soft sweater, this is NOT the one. The material is 60% Polyester, 40% Rayon, making it a bit rough in feel. For warmth wool is better, for softness Cashmere is better. I feel this sweater is very overpriced. I guess you are mostly paying for Adidas or the team logo. Not sure why the product description uses the words hoodie as It doesn't have one, or a jacket which is not one either.<br />On the plus side the sweater has a nice collar design and good stripe detailing.<br /><br />Please click below vote if you found my review helpful so I can improve them to help others like you.",

There is always a lot that has to be arranged, so it's nice to be able to plug in the compressor and attend to other things while the board inflates. This compressor can go as high as 16 PSI, but I usually run my paddle boards at around 7 PSI. The automatic shut off provides the assurance that you won't have an accidental over inflation.<br /><br />The compressor includes a variety of valve heads so this compressor can be used with various types of inflatables.

I am specifically writing this review for the 6' light-to-moderate fast action rod.<br /><br />I selected this rod to go with a new reel I have, with the intention of hitting the lake and going after largemouth bass. This has proven to be a nice rod that has worked out well for me.<br /><br />When this rod arrived, it came in a heavy cardboard tube and was secured inside with foam rubber. Most rods I have ordered online come in a plastic wrap and packed in a light cardboard box. This was a huge surprise but was positive - the likelihood of this rod getting damaged in shipping is very low.<br /><br />The rod is in two section (which is typical) and it assembles as expected and in negligible time. When fully assembled the rod is 6' as advertised. Attaching the reel I had in mind was minimal effort too, and I was ready to go to the lake in less than 10 minutes.<br /><br />The eyes in the rod provide little to no resistance to the line during the cast. I have dealt with rods that hinder the cast; this one does not.<br /><br />This is a sensitive rod and I have had no issues feeling when the fish hit. Being light to medium, pulling in a good-sized fish is a bit of work but it's not any more difficult than other rods of this type I have used.<br /><br />It seems to be made well and I have found no problems with damage to the rod, loose eye ties, or a loose cuff for the reel which I have seen with some rods. With proper care this rod should last for several years.<br /><br />I have not had this rod long but so far all indicators are good. It seems to be made well, it was very definitely packaged well, and it performs nicely. It is reasonably priced too.",

It is thick, durable and can take whatever you dish out. It will win too. It is an exercise just standing on the band and pulling up or trying to open it with your legs or arms. This is the strongest band I have ever seen. I will be able to exercise my back, arms, legs. You name it, if a resistance band can handle it, this band can. I had the girl child stand on it and try to lift her arms, wasn't easy for her to this. I actually had to laugh at her because she thinks she is very strong. This got her.

At any time we may have to stay overnight (it is not near our home) so I want to be sure to have what we need for those unexpected nights.  I have managed to get an inflatable bed at the home, and a sleeping bag, but I wanted a nice memory foam pillow that could be used.  This pillow seems just right. Let's talk about it..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS PILLOW LIKE?<br />This pillow comes in a package about the size of a large can of Juicy Juice or Pineapple Juice.  It has a drawstring that closes it.  What it is is folded upon itself.  When the pillow is pulled out of its own pocket, it expands to a perfect personal sized pillow.  One side is flocked and the other side is nylon feeling fabric like you would find in a winter jacket that is not slick but woven.<br /><br />HOW DOES IT PERFORM?<br />This pillow is PERFECT.  It has shredded foam inside of it but it is under filled so you can move it around to fit your head and neck.  I LOVE that feature.  It is just right for me as I need an under filled pillow.<br /><br />SMELL<br />The only problem with this is that it smells really heavily of chemicals.  I am not sure if it is pesticides like they use in warehouses, or if it is just chemicals from production.  I hope it fades because so far it is pretty strong.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This pillow folds up to a pretty small size.  When open it is a perfect size for personal sleeping, and it is easy to shift the stuffing around to make room for the head and neck support without being too firm.  My only difficulty with it is the smell.  If it goes away, then it will be perfect.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  I really hope the smell goes away because it is pretty intense, but I will assume it will.  If anything changes, I will try to remember to update the rating and comment to let you know.",

            "question": "title: Big deck is great for a street riding returning beginner like me. Big wheels roll over debris\ntext: I'm closer to 50 years old than 40 I haven't skated since ALF was on TV but I have been eyeing the new style boards for a while now. I chose the long board style because it seemed better for riding around the neighborhood & I hoped no one would expect me to do tricks on it. As a returning rider who has been out of touch for a few decades I can't expertly critique the board but I am thoroughly enjoying it & it has good features for a street board. My daughter's boyfriend borrowed it to take to the park so it must have the right look.<br />This board is big. At 41\", it comes up to my belt when stood on end and gives a stable ride but takes a lot of space to turn. It also seems wider than I remember from my '80s boards & there is a lot of space to move around. The wheels are about 2 3/4\" in diameter which is good for rough pavement & rolling over pebbles & even the occasional stick. It's heavier than my old boards which is good for riding if not carrying.<br />I'm still getting the hang of \"pumping\" the board but kicking it is certainly faster than walking & a good reason to get out & around the neighborhood. I tightened the trucks to make them stiffer while I get used to it but I always preferred stiffer trucks anyway.<br />The deck is thick, 1/2\" plywood, the top is completely covered with good grip tape & the bottom is painted. It has some concavity which helps to turn. The edges of the plywood are stained & look great except the scratches I have put on the ends. Despite the thickness & concavity, the deck flexes a lot due to the distance between the trucks. I don't know how normal this is since it is my first longboard. It's probably exacerbated by me tightening the trucks.",

            "question": "title: A lot of fun for the kids and me fairly easy to learn is heavy & robust The name brand is reassuring\ntext: My daughter had been wanting a Hoverboard so I was pleased with how excited she still was to receive this 4 years after asking for one. She had it un-boxed and riding around the living room within minutes. It took me less than 5 minutes to stand on it and creep it around the room. Within half an hour I was speeding around the dining room table and doing figure 8s and spins on the hardwood. With the large, rubber wheels & self-balancing, I believe that it is easier to learn than a skateboard. I feel much safer getting a name-brand Hoverboard & not a cheap copy from the mall.<br /><br />It handles the hardwood great & hasn't left any marks on the floor. We wipe off the tires after it has been used outside to keep any rocks or such it may have picked up from marring the floor but I haven't noticed anything stuck in the treads when cleaning them. Sometimes when turning sharply, the unloaded, outside wheel will spin a little giving the rider a bit of a start.<br /><br />We don't have carpets to try it on but with the large wheels, I don't think it would slow it down much. We do use it on a bumpy, brick floor which is more challenging but it does well. The base boards in the house have taken a bit of a beating and the paint transferred to the board (see picture).<br /><br />The board has a lot of lights on both sides and they actually help navigate in a dark room. I'm not sure whether it has a front & back since it doesn't seem to matter from which end it is boarded and it goes just as well in either direction. With the app, the lights can be changed to flash, strobe, stay on or flash to music played over it's speakers.<br /><br />Speaking of the speakers,it would sound better just coming from the rider's phone rather than under their feet. The speakers sound like they are in a metal can but it may have more to do with their non-ideal, floor-level location than the quality of the speakers. You do have the option of syncing the flashing lights to the music which is a neat effect.<br /><br />The board is heavy! It may help to stabilize it but it is not very portable. It takes a couple of hours to charge. I think it lasts about 2 hours on a charge but it's hard to say since we haven't ever run it non-stop & my daughter doesn't always wait until it is fully charged.<br /><br />The app allows it to be set in \"beginner\", \"intermediate\" or \"expert\" mode. It comes defaulted to \"expert\". I wish I had known earlier, it surely would have been easier to learn on one of the slower settings.<br /><br />This has been a lot of fun. We have enjoyed riding it around, challenging each other to do tasks & tricks and just standing on it while watching TV. I would love to be able to use it at the airport.",

I am a walker, not a runner.<br /><br />Out of the box, it was obvious that this was going to be an easy installation.  I slid the end of the straps out of the clasp, threaded them through the back piece, and wrapped them around the console.  After closing the clasps, I adjusted the strap lengths to position the back piece on the top of the console.<br /><br />There was a bit of a hurdle to properly secure the shelf.  There is no hinge in the shelf.  Instead, you adjust the point where the shelf rests on the back piece's support.  It can be a little tricky, but I did not have much trouble getting the shelf to be horizontal.  Total time including removing the shelf, reading the instructions a second time to clarify some points and installing it properly was 15 seconds.<br /><br />The support seems good.  I placed a Dell XPS laptop on the shelf.  I was able to secure it with the strap, and the shelf felt stable.  I was playing movies most of the time, but I also did some typing and scrolling with the touch pad.  I was also easily able to partially close the laptop to see the top of the console.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Easy installation<br />Works as advertised<br />No need to make your own shelf that may or may not work<br />Good size to provide solid support to even large laptops<br />Easily adaptable to many exercise machines<br /><br />CONS:<br />A bit pricy for what you get, but then you save time and money making a shelf<br />Obscures the console, but I can still reach under the shelf to get to the controls okay<br />I do not see it working well with a tablet<br />The strap that holds the laptop covers some of the controls and keyboard (YMMV on this one)<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />This was a good buy.

            "question": "title: well worth it if you have access to lakes and places to paddle\ntext: Awesome.<br /><br />These are nicely molded polyetheylene kayaks.  They're light (because they're small), durable, and super easy to paddle.<br /><br />These are easy even for kids to paddle.  Although they're best for just having fun, we've gone distances with them too.  My 8 year old can keep up with my canoe paddling a mile.  I tow my 7 year old some of the time.  After the first mile, I've towed both (as a train).<br /><br />Flotation is good, especially since they have foam in both ends.  They're not easy to swamp, but they certainly won't sink.  They are not easy to re-enter, but this is something that takes skill with any boat.  My boys have been successful re-entering several times, but it can be difficult and there has been times they failed without help.  Always wear a life jacket, and never go alone.<br /><br />It comes with a styrofoam billet in the front which adds extra flotation.  It's a good idea, but not durable as kids will kick it with their feet down there and it will come apart (it's just white styrofoam).  I removed the billets (from two kayaks) and replaced them with Polyform A-0 buoys secured to an eyebolt.  I replaced the lag screw that holds the billets in with an eyebolt.  The foam in the stern is unreachable and unlikely to be damaged.  I wonder if it could hold muck in there, but haven't had an issue so far.<br /><br />My wife at 5'1&#34; and 100 pounds fits these nicely but a boat with slightly more leg room would be a little better.  They easily hold her weight though.  Even I fit them at 5'8&#34; and 140 pounds, but I am really too big to fit the short length.  I can fully straighten my legs, but my feet are all the way to narrow part of the bow.  My weight causes the bow to ride too low in the water.  Old Towne limits them to 100 to 115 pounds, which is about right.  I would also put the height limit at 5 feet, but a heavier and taller person can fit in a pinch.<br /><br />Because I have paddled these myself, I can say they are a delight to paddle.  They're very fast and efficient, and they turn well.  Of course they're very short and narrow for my size, so that is not surprising.  However, I would not want a wider, longer boat for my boys as it would be harder to paddle and harder to turn.<br /><br />They're expensive compared to cheaper two-piece or sit-on-top kayaks carried by stores that sell lots of cheap imports.  I think they're worth it, especially if you have the opportunity to do a significant amount of paddling with your kids.  They're probably too expensive for a beach toy that you use for a once a year trip.  We've been paddling with them at least 7 times in the last two months since we got them, and will probably go another 7 times in the next two months before winter.<br /><br />I paddle a canoe myself so I can fit my wife and I and our dog, plus any cargo we want.  The canoe is a lot of fun too but has tradeoffs.  It is harder to paddle. It is much more affected by wind.  It is a beast to carry (it's an Old Towne and polyethylene also, about 80 pounds).  Even though it is a smaller canoe (14'7&#34;) I could fit my family of four, our big dog, and some cargo in it.  Even so, I think it was well worth it to get the kids their own boats.  They have far more fun and its more motivating for them to go.",

            "question": "title: for extra long term storage, add flavor and texture, good to have options to choose from\ntext: I buy Augason products when they are on sale. Been doing this on and off for a few years now. Always been a bit of a \"prepper\", since I was a toddler it seems, haha (In my 40s now). I has served me well through power outages, sicknesses, unemployment, and even bigger stuff like the pandemic, and now... *vaguely gestures around* everything else that is going on. I've never been one to be without when anything has come up. I never did \"emergency food\" if only because I didnt have the budget. I would stick with typical foods and try to store them well. Well now I have a little more wiggle room in my budget, and with the on and off sales of long term storage (20+ years), I take advantage when I can. I remember buying some Augason eggs back in 2019 for $19. Today? $33-56 for same container, depending on the day. So yeh, keep an eye on prices, buy on sale. If just starting skip the \"emergency\" food, and just work on picking up extra cans and bags of stuff every time you hit the market. Food lasts a whole lot longer than what the \"expiration date\" claims. No need to fuss. Just store in cool dark area, and from personal experience nothing really goes bad bad. Except acidic products where you want to rotate those out. Or ground brown grains, as the oils can get gross. But even pasta and flour has been perfectly fine for several years without fuss. That being said, if you are at point that you want to buy it and forget it, then buying some emergency cans and buckets of food can take the guess workout. Hence, products like what Augason Farms offers.<br /><br />And so, I haven't opened this 2lbs 6 ounce can of \"chicken\" crumbles.. sorry. I dont intend to open this any time soon. My can looks good, and it feels heavy. All goof. I have quite a bit of bagged stuff to get through first, and I will likely continue to top off from stuff I get to store, then simply know I have this as back up to the back up. I'm not vegan nor vegetarian, but I have no problem incorporating some meat alternatives. I simply eat everything and so I stack my pantry depicting this. Options are good!  And with this,  I wanted to shore up my non meat options. Having this, and some veggies, some soups and biscuiot mixes, etc.. all can lend to a good meal.<br /><br /> I have a slew of reviews to write on various Augason products, and so they will all be pretty much the same: Super long term storage (25+ years, unless a bread/biscuit mix then it might be closer to 10 years), no matter what the weight, it will be stuffed into a #10 can (that reads, \"number ten\", not ten pound. I see that mistake in reviews). They keep sizes uniform. Next size up is a round bucket, next size up gets into the rectangular buckets. This is for storage that can be uniform, etc. So yes, you may buy a 7 ounce item that is volume wise that takes up a smidge of space, but it will be packed into a large #10 container. Just remember, all food products are sold based on weight, not volume anyway. All of my containers have been in perfect condition. Maybe one day soon I will try one container out and see how the product actually is.<br /><br />Everyone's SHTF scenario varies. It could be bad weather (tornadoes, hurricanes, blizzards, ice storms), could be illness, could be road trip gone wrong (you do keep supplies in your car too, right?!), could be unemployment, or power outage, or lack of transportation, or oven/fridge/other appliance break down, or bigger stuff like plagues, food shortages, supply chain issues, *cough WW3 cough*, etc. No matter the situation we all need some things to get by: we need is food, water, shelter, some hygeine and medical stuff, and so on. You dont have to stack \"emergency supplies\" but you do need to stack shelf stable food items. Buy a few extra things every single time you go to the store. If you get to a spot that you feel comfortable and have the budget, then grab the \"emergency\" items like Augason offers. I like adding it in and just forgetting about it.<br /><br />I give 5 stars because the cans always are in perfect condition, they have regular sales, are good about shipping items as soon as they can, have lots of items to choose from, and so far seem to be of good quality.",

            "question": "title: Great bat, added 20-30 feet to my sons distance.\ntext: For a full review please check out generationXdad<br /><br />This will be my sons last year of playing machine pitch, next year we move up to kid pitch. Last year we used an aluminum baseball bat, it wasn't bad but I did notice that kids with composite bats seemed to be hitting the ball much further.<br /><br />Composite bats have a high &#34;trampoline effect,&#34; meaning that the ball comes off faster because of the material used in the bat. When a ball hits a traditional wood bat, it gets compressed before taking off, and loses energy in the process, so it comes out more slowly. In a metal or composite bat, the bat compresses instead, so the ball retains most of its energy and flies off at a higher speed.<br /><br />Additionally, the carbon fiber of composite bats actually becomes more flexible with each hit. Their ability to compress goes up, and the balls fly off faster and faster.<br /><br />So this year we decided to pick up a new composite bat for the season. After reading reviews and talking to a few parents we decided to go with the Miken Rev-Ex.<br />If you spend a little time looking at composite bats you’ll find there’s a lot of options out there that range in price from $150 to $300+.  I definitely didn’t want to spend over $200 for a baseball bat. Miken came in at the price point I was looking for. We pulled the trigger and purchased the bat from Amazon (points, points, points)<br /><br />Because of this you should check with the league your child plays in and make sure that composite bats are allowed. We play in Babe Ruth, composite bats are still allowed, however Little League only allows approved bats (This bat is on their approved list).<br /><br />The first day my son started using the Miken Rev-Ex I noticed a difference in how far he could hit the ball. I would guess he added a solid 20 to 30 feet in distance to his solid hits. I also notice that balls hit in the infield were like bullets! Any solid hit off this bats comes off with speed!<br /><br />So far my son has been very happy with the Miken Rev-Ex and has been taken extra care of it!<br /><br />Final Review: For the price and performance I’m very happy with the improvements that I have seen. I can’t speak to warranty and hope that I never need to. If you’re looking for a good fairly priced composite bat then I recommend the Miken Rev-Ex.<br />Being an Amazon Prime member I had the bat in two days. First thing I noticed was the warning label on the bat.",

            "question": "title: Great Set For Us When We Travel- VERY Versatile\ntext: When I saw this set, I got very excited.  We had planned to spend a week at a cabin where the water was not that great.  We go for a lot of walks and have brought our own water to drink while we are at the cabin, but it is a hassle when going for walks to bring all of our water.  Then I saw this kit-- Let's take a look.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS KIT LIKE?<br />This kit is very versatile.  It comes with a variety of ways to use it for clean water.<br /><br />SCREW ON TOP FOR PLASTIC/GLASS BOTTLES<br />I know, this is for walks and travel so glass is not practical.  I included it here because I liked to keep the bottle in the fridge when we were not walking so that I could have cooler water in glass.  However, once I tried to use it, I realized it won't work.  You need to have the container draw in when pushing the water through the filter, and glass is rigid.<br /><br /> The bottles I used for plastic are a Polar Seltzer bottle that is a liter.  It is easy to carry and is larger for a bigger water supply.  I also used it in the fridge when not hiking for a solid supply of water.<br /><br />BAG<br />If you want to have a truly portable device, there is the bag.  It is also a liter and it collapses for easy transport and then when you want to fill it with water, you can and use it to drink. There is a threaded top that goes on the pouch to attach the spout to, or you can cover it up completely to carry with you if not intending to use right away.<br /><br />STRAW<br />You can also use this by attaching the straw that comes with the package to the end of the filter and put it in a container of water to drink.<br /><br />INLINE FILTER<br />If you plan to do a lot of hiking and have a backpack that you use for water, this can be used inline.  I have not used it for that yet, but plan to test it out on a hike this summer.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?<br />This performs very well.  I have to say that I did not expect it to work as well as it does.  It is a bit tricky to get the water to get up through the filter at first because the filter requires some suction to pass the water through so it can be filtered.  Once you realize that, it is not as frustrating.  The water we used appeared to be clean (in other words not muddy) and it worked out nicely.<br /><br />TASTE<br />This definitely improves taste, even from tap water at the cabin which was not the greatest.  It does a pretty good job.<br /><br />WHAT ABOUT MUDDY WATER?<br />Call me a baby.  Go ahead.  I can not bring myself to use this in muddy water, even to test it.  Perhaps if I am desperate I will do that, and then I can update this review.  Until then, well, I am sure some other brave person will have given you their results on it in the meanwhile.<br /><br />CLEANING<br />That is the frustration of this filter.  We don't use it constantly, so there comes a time when you have to run bleach water through the unit and in the pouch if you use that before storing.  It has to sit for a while and then air dry.  You use the enclosed syringe and ring and backwash the filter and pouch with water that includes a capful of bleach.  I understand why this has to happen, but air drying takes quite a while and when I first go to use the unit again later, it tastes like bleach which I despise.<br /><br />After a while it rinses out, but I really don't like that part.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For a great set which really does help for hiking in an area where there might not be great water, this is handy to have.  It is easy to clean and although I am not fond of the bleach method, I know why it must be done for future use.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  I love having this for our cabin stays.  It makes it so we can drink water out on the trails and not have to worry about it being unsafe.  I plan to get a 2nd one for my husband so we can each have our own.  I also like having it in the cabin to run through the water in there as I have not been overly sure of it in the past.",

            "question": "title: I like this fly\ntext: I liked this fly after watching a few videos online. I decided to purchase the HouseFly vs. others. I loved that it has ends that can be closed off or rolled back, and the larger size of the HouseFly was my main reason for purchasing it.<br /><br />I received mine yesterday and promptly went about setting it up outside. I wanted a fair test before heading out on the trail. Last night was a superb choice as it was to rain, and it did. I remained totally dry. I needed the unpack and set up once before heading out, and I recommend that to anyone. It helped wipe out some rough edges on my setup technique.<br /><br />Setup was easy for my first time. We worked at a rather moderate pace, especially when my 8-year old wanted to help put in the stakes for the tie-down ropes.  The stakes are not included in the fly and must be purchased separately. I chose the orange-colored fly over the green as it makes the fly easier seen. After setting up my fly, I promptly forgot the first rule, walk further away from the tie-down cordage and stakes. Where I immediately tripped myself up.<br /><br />I was not rather impressed with the included tie-down cordage. It is rather stiff, and I prefer ropes which are easily bendable and packable. Not to mention easier to stake out. So, I will be replacing the cordage with some paracord with a softer, more pliable body. This is the first real con I have had with ENO products. But to be totally fair to them, I almost always find that cordage included with a product doesn't live up to my personal desires/expectations. You may find the cordage fine and have no issue with it. I also wanted a slightly longer length on the ridge ties. The cordage may be fine after some initial usage, but in my usage, the cordage was just as stiff upon taking down the fly as it was putting it up.<br /><br />I would still repurchase the HouseFly in a moment, with or without the cordage. I will indeed be buying it again for the wife and her hammock, though I think I'll choose a green or blue version for her. Doing so will allow me to switch out my color as my mood fits.  I'll likely buy something smaller for the kids.<br /><br />Oh, It's rather large, I think we could safely hang side by side under the fly.<br /><br />edit 12/28/2017<br /><br />Yes, two people can hang under the fly though I set it up slightly wider than usual. I ended up not being able to close the doors. I didn't want to adjust my setup. It rained the evening, and the fly kept up perfectly dry all night.",

            "question": "title: Great indoor fun! Just make sure you have enough room\ntext: It's winter here on the east coast, and my kids need indoor activities that keep them moving! This is an INCREDIBLE fun arcade experience at home, provided you have enough room for it. Yes, it folds up which helps tremendously, however this is pretty true-to-scale arcade style game, which means you need high ceiling clearance as well. We have a guest room that we use as a home gym, and it actually wouldn't fit because the ceiling isn't high enough to shoot. Thankfully, I was able to move it out to the garage which is PERFECT. I feel like I'm very lucky to have the room for this, because my previous home had a garage under bedrooms with room-high ceilings which wouldn't have worked very well.<br />I DID have some difficulty building the game, as the instructions were a little bit unclear at some parts (there are at least 2 steps that could have been made a LOT clearer and saved me a lot of time backing up and redoing parts), and it doesn't come with any extra hardware so you need to really be careful not to lose of it during assembly. We had to supplement 2 washers and a bolt from parts I had around the house already because we appear to have lost some on the way. BUT- once assembled, this is great fun! The arcade play and sounds is just perfect and a TON of fun for everyone!",

            "question": "title: Sturdy and Easy to Transport and Store\ntext: I have a large backyard with a pool and since I live in a warm climate, we tend to spend to good deal of time outside, either using the pool, sitting on the patio, or playing games. We have a good number of outdoor games and when I heard about the Franklin Sports Optima All- Weather Outdoor Tennis Table, I was more than ready to add it to my household’s recreational options.<br /><br />From the large box, this table tennis set does take some time to assemble, so be prepared. Once you get everything set, it is a matter of rolling the table from place to place. My garage is the present location for the table because we can use it here, when we want to play a round of table tennis inside. When we want to take it outside, it is just a matter of rolling it from the garage through the backyard gate and into the back yard.<br /><br />This table tennis set is sturdy and seems like it was built to last. It is heavy, and you will realize this the moment the box arrives in the mail. But the fact that it is on wheels makes you not really notice the weight. It is easy to transport from place to place because of this and when folded, it fits into small spaces for storage. And while the table is made for outdoor use, I think it is best to make it a point to wheel it back inside or into a storage shed after each use. I debated this at first and considered just permanently leaving it outside. But then I decided it was better to make sure it lasts by protecting it from the weather.<br /><br />The aluminum surface on this table tennis set is smooth and ideal for a round of table tennis. The balls bounce well on this surface and the net is easy to install and take down when you’re ready to fold the table and roll it back inside. The table is nine feet long and five feet wide so it will fit in most game rooms. Unlike a billiard table, you don’t need a lot of space on each side so it should fit in many rooms of the typical house.<br /><br />Outdoor games like cornhole and croquet have been part of our backyard recreation for some time and now table tennis is part of the picture, thanks to the franklin Sports Optima All- Weather Outdoor Table Tennis Table. The ease of transporting it and the heavy- duty aluminum construction make this table tennis set a cut above the competition and a great option for people like me who spend a good deal of time outdoors.",

Classy looking gym or personal bag, durable, PLEASE see note on measurements\ntext: TAKE NOTE that THE SIZE: is 17\" wide, 15\" long, and 5\" deep.<br /><br />The product description shows the measurements in two spots, depending on where you look it will be smaller or larger than the measurements I took. In the written headline, the sizing is listed as 15\"x13\"x3.5\".  In the PICTURE portion, it says that it is 20.5\" Long X 14.7\" Wide X 15.4\" deep (lol, it is not 15+ inches deep!)<br /><br />The third spot, for \"package dimensions\" is closed to my measurements.<br /><br />So for the big discrepancies, I down rate to 4. Product is otherwise a solid 5.<br /><br />---The straps for securing a yoga mat (or roll of towel, clothes, etc) is well designed. I was concerned about placement of those straps. I couldnt tell where they were anchored. I didnt know if they were anchored outside, and that there would be flopping straps when not in use Or are they anchored inside, and I would need to have the bag open to access the straps.  But in fact, they are anchored in the bag, tucked away, and can be accessed by pulling them through open ports. So this means that the bag can be fully closed, and the straps can be pulled out from side holes, and then used to strap whatever you want onto it.<br /><br />---The REALLY COOL feature of this is that they aren't limited to strapping something large on. They have press hooks- so you can hook your keys, or hand sanitzer bottle, etc. Pull the strap through to have it as a hook on outside of bag, or keep it tucked inside for a hook inside the bag. The other side is a D ring, so if you have a carbiner or other press hook, then you can use this to attach it to. Really good design in this regards. Makes it a more versatile tote.<br /><br />---Interior is like a purse. Instead of interior side pockets, there is an interior center panel that has a zipper portion (with additional swivel pressure hook) and a wide open pocket which begs for a water bottle.  Remainder of tote is open. Not sure if I like how the interior panel is attached. It is just in the center and doesnt run length of bag. It could have still be attached to the side with ability to put a water bottle in. Maybe with more use I will figure out if this is a good design or not. It doesnt really hinder use, and it might in fact add more options for someone.<br /><br />--Exterior on one side has a zipper pocket and an open pocket. Opposite side has an open pocket.<br /><br />---Material is sturdy, durable, and I am assuming water resistant, if not waterproof. It has a flat bottom, like a narrow rectangle. Lies flat when empty/not in use.<br /><br />---Nice long adjustable shoulder strap with padded shoulder portion. Long enough for cross body use.<br /><br />---The shoulder strap is also optional. It is attached via D ring and pressure clip on a swivel. (similar to style of the yoga mat straps). Very durable feeling.  Cant tell if it is a thick heavy plastic or is metal. Either way, I feel confident in its durability, strength<br /><br />--Also has comfortable hand straps, that are just long enough to get up on the shoulder.<br /><br />OVERALL: I like it. It is the size and style that I like for an everyday carry. I dont go into stores or other places with big purses, but I do like to carry a variety of stuff. So I have my main items and then the items of the day. I then keep it in the car as I go about my day.<br /><br />Whether you are using it for gym stuff, personal stuff, or switch back and forth between the two, I think you will like it. I dont rate on price, but I do comment. I am currently using [[ASIN:B07WT75VTZ  baggallini Avenue Tote Top Handle Bag]] as my every day \"carry all\". I own several bags, all similarly priced. Excellent quality, so I rarely stray. I am familiar with Gaiam products, and this price for their quality is within reason.",

            "question": "title: Man what a find. Read full review for details\ntext: I work as a Service Tech and Head of Maintenance for a few restaurants. So I have ALOT of keys and I do mean ALOT. Honestly the jailers keep ring would be great for me but I just don't see me using that for my needs.<br />I have a company ride and one day I panices when I realized I didn't have my car keys.  My old key ring I was using had a really bad habit of releasing keys off of it when I would snap onto my belt or pants pocket. So of course I worried my new rides keys were gone. Thank God I just left at home but that moment I swore I was spending what ever I needed to so I could make sure I wouldn't loose not 1 key.<br />After a hour or so looking searching I finally happened upon this contraception.<br />Looked cool seems very useful and I honestly could see why I should trust it not to just release my keys.<br />I was right 💯 right on the head with these.<br />The double slide makes sure there can be no accidental key drops.  You have to manually remove them for the keys to come off.  This was perfect for my uses and needs.  I can remove the set I need per store and keep the rest safe.  The clip on very easily but I can't say that for removing them. Which is exactly what I wanted.  They are made of a good sturdy metal, no plastic. No plastic locks no cheapness at all.  I love the entire idea and give the inventory a pat on their backs.  I love Mt key ring and wouldn't change it for the world.  Best I've ever used and I've been through a few different ones.<br />Thanks alot guys, I haven't worried about loosing keys since the day I got this in my box.<br /><br />I have NOT been paid for this review nor any other review so far. (I wish I would though).<br />This is, as always, just and only my opinion thought my own eyes and felt with my own hands.  I take reviews serious, as I rely on them to make my decisions before any and all my purchases. So if you have found my review helpful please vote and let the other Amazonian Browsers get a better judgment of what to expect and how the product works.  Thank you for your time and happy buying.",

The family has enjoyed it immensely, and this table has taken a lot of use in the past year.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- good build quality for a low price. Have had this for over a year, and holding up nicely.<br />- table is easy to set up and level<br />- air hockey jets allow the disc to move smoothly all around the table<br />- table tennis surface is smooth and flat- no warping or uneven seams.<br />- everyone loves it! Have had many hours of enjoyment... family tournaments, challenges. It really provides some quality family times<br />- stands up to some pretty heavy teenager use, so that is a great testament to the quality of this table.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- the table tennis is smaller than regulation. Nor necessarily a con, and it is still plenty of fun, but we had some trouble playing doubles on it.<br />- table tennis surface lays flat, but there isn't anything to keep it in place. It takes some adjustment to get it straight, and is prone to get out of whack if you bump the table. But this has really been far less of an issue than we initially thought it would be, and you can't beat the price.<br />- the net for the table tennis had to be replaced already, so just expect a 5 dollar cost after about a year. A minor issue, at best.<br />- the air hockey discs and paddles work great, but the table tennis paddles are garbage. We replaced them with real paddles almost immediately.<br />- air hockey has sound effects and automatic scoring... but my kids don't like the voice, so we just turn it off... easy enough.<br /><br />All in all, we could not be happier with this table. It iui s just a ton of fun for my family and you can't beat the price.<br /><br />If you are even considering this, I would highly recommend getting it. (It even gets my teenager off of his phone and actually interacting with the family)",

It really gets rid of the pain in my back & since im in my early 30s it really works! It takes some getting used too thats for sure.

I purchased this ball to sit on to work core and back strength but I am going to say this 75cm is only good for people up to 6'0&#34; in height.

Although it does the job well and using it is almost exercise itself, the tube doesn't appear that it will last very long because it's so thin, especially at the end that attaches to the pump itself.

My yoga mats fit in it comfortably and the adjustable strap on the bag makes the bag easy to carry. There is an interior pocket too that can fit quite a bit. It is great for keeping your car keys and a water bottle. There are little air holes so if you keep used clothing in it it is going to be breathable. The zipper also seems really strong and the material the bag is made from is very strong. I believe this is a yoga bag that is going to last a long time.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review<br /><br />I received one free bag for review purposes. This review is my honest opinion.",

            "question": "title: JUNK after less than 3 mos\ntext: I am posting a \"reserved\" review...After the experience buying the black one for my husband and the first one arrived, opened and not working!  (BAD Amazon order fufillers sending an obviously opened and non-functioning product)  I have had my Shine for about a week... I wear in on my wrist most of the time.. I chose to remove it before bathing.  If I were swimming I would leave it on, although the propoganda states that if you wear in \"treated\" water it reduce it's life - odd to me.  Also, it doesn't auto sync.  You must sync it to your phone each day.  The upside is that you don't have to charge it, just replace the battery.  It seems to be fairly accurate.  I will update if there are any use/wear issues.  It arrived quickly (I have prime) and in good condition.<br /><br />UPDATE 10/15/2014..... So... I've been using the Shine for about a month... it hasn't failed, to my knowledge. It syncs when prompted to, although I have found sometimes it takes longer than others even though I set it right next to my phone each time.  It has survived one system \"update\" without noticeable issues. I chose to remove it when bathing. I do wish it auto synced rather than to manually prompt it to do so every morning.  I have learned that if you are interested in following your sleep pattern one night at a time (it doesn't provide a graph of experience, however you can review night by night - would be nice to have an over all view), you must use the wrist band.  Using the magnetic clip does not provide sleep info. Also note: when using the magnetic clip, be aware that it is HIGHLY likely to detach from you and attach to something else magnetic if it gets close and you may not even notice that you've left your Shine on something else.  The \"watch\" band seems to be very durable. The time option of the Shine is interesting and maybe entertaining for a short while, however, it is not as \"obvious\" as you might think.  It is very easy to misread. I found myself double-checking my phone a lot because I would think... hmm... my Shine says 5:30 but I KNOW it's 6:30. I eventually chose to \"turn off\" the watch function.  Which is another thing.. to change anything you must be attached to where ever you downloaded the progam, not an option on the Shine itself.  All of this is just information for those of you who are researching options.  Honestly, the best part of the Shine for me is the battery and not having to charge it each night or every few nights. I didn't think I would mind the wrist band, but I am bored with it and it's look now, which sometimes interfers with my jewelry options. I considered the necklace accessory, however, the reviews of it were overwhelming not so great, so I stuck with the wrist band and the clip that comes with it. Over all it seems to fairly accurately record movement. However, when this one fails, I am probably going to search out the next option unless they do the subtle upgrades mentioned above... but even then, I think I'm still looking for the device that works best for me.  Hope this info helps you in your research!<br />UPDATE: NOV 18 2014.... Sooo...about 2 months in and now it sometimes doesn't sync the sleep info. Randomly it just fails. And it would be nice if it would provide a graph or chart or some analysis of your sleep and workout info... but nope.  It does now sync with My fitness pal, which is a free easy way of keeping track of your food/calories. Honestly, it's still disappointing because there are so many others that offer you more for about the same amount of money.<br /><br />UPDATE: 12/4/2014.... Ok... the shine has officially stopped syncing... it's been \"sputtering\"... not recording data... taking a really long time to sync... etc.. I tried replacing the battery just in case.  So... in less than 3 months.. it has stopped working. I would NOT recommend this pedometer at all. You would like to think it work for at least a year!  I have the first gen fit bit... I just wanted one I could wear on my wrist.  Honestly, I think I will try the wrist model of the fitbit.",

Since my KickBoxing gym closed last Saturday, I bought this standing heavy bag to work out with in my garage, til I find another suitable, close by, affordable place to kickbox again. This bag is a let down.<br /><br />For starters, it takes a good several minutes to &quot;roll&quot; to the center of the garage (I park my car inside when not boxing) to the point I'm done by the time it's in its proper place.  LOL I am used to a 140-170 lb hanging bag, but can't have one in my garage, as there'd be no place to park my ride.<br /><br />Even with 200 lbs of sand in the bottom, it's not strong enough to withstand a front or side kick, I can only do round house kicks. And when I punch it, the bottom piece lifts off the ground/floor, while the top (foam) continues to pop up, as I've never been able to make it lock into place successfully.<br /><br />Don't get me started in trying to use a timer on my iphone6 (Siri, you suck!). To use Siri's voice activated feature, you must have the phone plugged in to power, you can't listen to music and Siri still didn't follow my commands.

            "question": "title: Mixed Feeling on These, Too Many Basic Problems!\ntext: [[VIDEOID:b5a53a0c1b472799ef4d5a2d386537bd]] I like certain things about these and can't stand certain other ones.  I cannot stand the location of the pockets. They are way too high and closer to the center.  They could have cut it at more of a slant but it still is too high.  You got to put your hands almost straight down into them.  While this is good for  stopping some pick pockets they are still open,  There should be a zipper secured side pocket inside the main pocket.  These don't even have side pockets at all.<br /><br />Now that;s out of the way it has a lot of pockets almost too many or they are not quite big enough to hold what you need them too..  The zipper in the front doesn't stay up unless zipped all the way and locked, so you;ll end up with your fly down if your not careful and don't make sure to get the zipper all the way up,  This is waste time,. in my opinion, at least.  The belt loops are too small to even accommodate an 2 inch utility belt.<br /><br />These are very comfortable and just about the proper warmth and cooling so they are good year round unless you live in Alaska , Siberia or any place that get below -10 degrees Fahrenheit on a regular basis.  I never really got uncomfortably hot or cold in these.  Some of the stitching is top notch and then there are others that are terrible.  The inside of the pocket are horribly stitched and I have never seen poor stitching on any good pair of BDU's or any  other military or law enforcement pant types called \"tactical\".<br /><br />I really like the ties around the legs that allow you to tie the legs tight either around your leg inside your boots or over the outside of your boot.  This is good for limiting bugs crawling up your pant legs and various other things.  Now they should've used some elastic ropes with a little fast tightener in place of the cheap ribbon.  There is also no loop on the waste back close to your pocket to clip anything to.<br /><br />So  I have decided that these are just not very good the more and more I try them out.  They just feel like everything is slightly out of place.  One more thing the belt loops will not accommodate any decent utility belts or even a thick well made gun belt. Not to mention I wouldn't trust the stitch-work either over any amount of time and duty. I usually wear 5.11 or Backhawk for civilian purposes and they never caused distractions.  One of the two no longer is making gear and the other is slacking so I was looking for a new supplier.  This was definitely not it. I think these are trying to be fashionable instead of tactical and you just cannot mix the two.  Same goes for combat boots!  If you are trying to look cool and have no real reason to need to wear BDU pants then go ahead and enjoy.  If you require something that actually provides performance and functionality then these are not for you.  I couldn't wear these to the range let alone any real  situation.",

            "question": "title: I Should Get Paid For The Work I Had To Do To Make This Work\ntext: I know.  There are some people out there who will get this item, have no issues with it and think it is marvelous.  I am not one of those people.  I had high hopes for this lounger, but my God, the stress I had to go through to make it work..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This comes in a very tight bag.  It is wound up tight and it has a clip to it.<br /><br />CLIP<br />The latch on the bag that you have to undo has a special button on it.  This button was turned around to face the rolled up bag, so I had no idea how to get it undone.  It took me 10 minutes to get the latch to work.  Finally it did.<br /><br />BAG DESIGN<br />This is a weird couch to be blunt.  All it is is clear plastic encased inside of ripstop nylon caseing.  There are two channels of plastic which need to capture air and a piece of mesh in between.<br /><br />On the end of the bag are flexible pieces encased in the ends which are supposed to be held open as you run through the area holding it up like a giant wind sock.  The idea is that these channels fill with air, you roll up the end and it is a beautiful thing.<br /><br />Yeah, if you like sweat running down your face and the neighbors wondering what the heck you are doing with this demented looking kite in your yard running around flapping like a sick bird.<br /><br />HOW IT REALLY WORKS<br />I took a HALF HOUR to try to get air into this thing.  It would twist and turn around itself every time I tried to fill it with air.  I could NOT get it to fill with air no matter what I did.<br /><br />My husband saw me struggling with this and came over with that knowing look that his stupid wife could not possibly understand how something this ingenious would work.  I gave it to him.<br /><br />A half hour later with all sorts of words I can not repeat, he said, \"How the heck is anyone supposed to do this without high winds?\"<br /><br />All of a sudden, a huge breeze came up and we both had to hold this thing in the air, pried open at the mouth to get the air encased in it.  It didn't work GREAT, but at least we got it somewhat inflated.<br /><br />HOW TO SHUT THE CHAIR IF YOU ARE LUCKY ENOUGH TO CATCH AIR<br />Once we got some air into it, I rolled up the back as tight as I could.  My husband sat in it and flipped over.  He was very irritated and tried again.  He started to sink to the ground.<br /><br />WHAT IF IT IS NOT FULL ENOUGH?<br />I rolled this thing up four more times and then tried it. It was full enough to lay on it without being ejected cartoon style on the lawn.<br /><br />IF YOU GET IT INFLATED HOW IS IT TO LAY ON?<br />After over an hour of work with this stupid thing, I finally got it tight enough where I could lay on it and have it not be sinking.  Then it happened.  The stupid thing began to sweat under me. Yes, there is mesh in the center, but within five minutes, I was sitting in a pool of sweat.  After about 15 minutes I had to get up and wipe off the chair.  It was 77 degrees out and the sun was in and out a bit.<br /><br />STAKE<br />This comes with a stake to make it not blow away in wind.  If you plan to use this on a beach, good luck with that.  The sand won't hold this tiny spike.<br /><br />SEAMS<br />Another thing- once the chair had been sat in for a while, I noticed the seams were coming out- and pulling TERRIBLY.  This thing would not last if you tried to put up to 600 lbs in it- heck not even under 200 lbs would it last a really long time.<br /><br />COMFORT AND ELDERLY<br />There are two other things I want to rant about with this chair.  It recommends that it is supportive and comfortable (once you get it inflated) and it is good even for elderly.  Let me tell you this.  It is not that comfortable, and getting out of it is horrible.  If you have an elderly person you want to embarrass, this is the chair to use.  You might find them laying flat on their face unable to get up from their prone position once they manage to get out of this marvelous chair.<br /><br />PUTTING IT AWAY<br />Then my last rant is about the storage bag.  Trying to roll this monstrosity into the small roll that fits into the tight bag is yet another frustration with this thing.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />As you can see, my experience with this chair is anything but stellar.  After working really hard with two people to get it inflated enough to use, the thing makes you sweat, and it is very hard to get out of.  It is not any kind of chair I would want to try to use without a high wind.  Then if you had high winds, you would not want to be laying in the thing, although it might blow your sweat away.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />ONE STAR.  This experience was not good.  I think this is WAY overpriced for what it is.  It might be portable and small for storage, but the amount of work it takes to have it useful, it just is not anything I would ever buy again.  About the only thing that did NOT happen is our cat trying to jump on it with her claws.",

I have bought the white and red lights that dangle from small cords that have sorta done the job, but they are inadequate. This is because I don't want them for a bicycle, I want them for my husband's power chair! This year everything's been cancelled, but we usually go to several science fiction conventions a year and leave long after dark, risking traveling through dark parking lots and also, for DragonCon, Atlanta streets with their maniac drivers. We also, of course, have to take the chair other places at night, and sometimes places where it needs to be lit up. We can carry a flashlight, sure, but I wanted to light up the chair without my husband having to sacrifice the use of a hand, and especially wanted it to be illuminated with red on the back.<br /><br />These are superior to most I've seen in several ways. First, none of those stupid teeny batteries to reload. These recharge! Second, they are a larger diameter than the smaller lights on the cords, and contain three LED bulbs instead of one, so they can easily be seen. Third, they do not have that inevitable type of plastic fastener that ONLY fastens on a bicycle handlebar. I've found a lot of prospective good lights, only to find they have a fastener that will only enable the light to be put on a handlebar. The clip will enable the white light to be fastened in some manner on the front while the red light can clip to the carrier on the back of the chair.<br /><br />The only problem with these lights is that, like everything that charges USB these days, they send you the cords AND NO ELECTRICAL PLUG.

Every time, the path ends up not being marked correctly and we wander round and round looking for a way home, usually with me crying and in pain.  I saw this stick and thought it would be great to take with me for my insane future journeys..<br /><br />My husband laughed when it came in the mail.  The very next day I fell and hurt my foot pretty badly.  He isn't laughing anymore.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS WALKING STICK LIKE?<br />This stick is realy nice.  It has the wood shaved off of it to look almost plastic in nature.  There are no rough edges or grooves to catch clothing or skin on.  It seems to be coated with a coating to make it water resistant too.  There is a metal inlay with the company name on it, a leather strap through a drilled hole, and a rubberized cane tip on the bottom for good grip.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS WORK?<br />Well, I have to say, I have never been so glad for anything like I have this walking stick the last few days.  When I am going up our narrow basement stairs, I am happy to say that this stick grips the stairs well and allows me to walk up and not fall in places where I can not reach the railing.  I also have had some issues in parts of our home where I needed an extra boost to get up from the floor.  This has helped me a LOT.<br /><br />STORAGE<br />What I love about this stick is that it stands up behind the door we have in between the molding around the door and the corner.  It is not at all in the way and easy to get to.<br /><br />CAN YOU MAKE THIS SHORTER?<br />I am pretty tall, so I appreciate how long this is.  For a shorter person, all you do is take the rubberized cap off, saw off how much you want, and then replace the cap again.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This walking stick is easy to store, grips well, and can be shortened if you need it to be.  It really has helped a lot with my injured foot.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE ENTHUSIASTIC STARS.  I will be taking this with me a lot on my crazy walks this spring and summer.  It has already become a trusted companion as my foot heals.",

            "question": "title: Everyone Fights Over This Chair If That Tells You Anything.. (Beware of Low Weight Limit)\ntext: Our family has started a tradition every summer of attending various camping activities, including a music festival.  It has become quite an undertaking with friends as well as family in attendance, picking up and extra person every year it seems.  Having enough chairs is always a concern.  Let's see how this one measures up.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS CHAIR LIKE?<br />This chair folds into a small piece which fits into a bag.  When open there are some really great features.  I am going to outline all of the features one by one in its own section.<br /><br />PADDING AND COMFORT<br />First of all the padding is minimal, however, the angle of the seat was comfortable for three of us- THAT ALMOST NEVER HAPPENS.  We all have different chair needs, and rarely do any of us agree on any one chair.<br /><br />WEIGHT LIMIT<br />225 lbs it says on the label.<br /><br />SIZE<br />This is an XL chair and it is perfect to sit comfortably in.  It is big enough for our teen to sit cross legged in (a deal breaker on every chair or couch EVER for that teen)<br /><br />SIDE POUCH<br />There is a side pouch with netting on it for a book, or other pamphlet, even lotion to keep on the chair.<br /><br />DRINK HOLDER<br />This is a round holder which fits cans of carbonated juice (their drink of choice) such as Izze and even a larger bottle such as they sell at Chipolte restaurants of Izze<br /><br />COLD PACK<br />This is the coolest thing- it has double zippers which are connected by a pull cord.  you pull on it with your finger/thumb and both zippers open, allowing you access to the insulated pack which is part of the chair!  When you are done, you close it and secure it with a velcro type closure.<br /><br />STABILITY<br />So far this is really stable and easy to set up as long as the ground is not too uneven.<br /><br />WEIGHT<br />This is heavy, but not as heavy as some chairs I have used.  It is easy to carry to a picnic or camp site, but not appropriate for hiking long distances.<br /><br />CLEANING<br />My big concern was if something got spilled in the insulated pack it would be hard to clean.  However, a wet cloth used to wipe it out good and left out to dry, it seems fine.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />With plenty of room to sit comfortably (yes, even if you insist on crossing your legs and are not too tall or over 225 lbs) this chair has some great features that are easy to use.  A medium weight chair that is easy to pack, we all are fighting over sitting in it today.  Considering that almost never happens, I would say that is a good indication that this chair is a winner here!  The one member of the family that is too heavy for it is kind of cranky about not being able to use it, but he has his own chair.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />This rating is FIVE STARS.  Although the weight limit is rather low for the size chair it is, I still really like it.  It is comfortable, has very convenient features, and is stable too.",

            "question": "title: Waterproof; Holds Water or Ice Without Leaking\ntext: Before working with this water bag I was unfamiliar with the concept of using a nylon bag as a way to hold water, and I struggled a bit to determine how to use this bag. As it turns out, I found a very good use for it that is similar to holding water but is a variation on a theme. In short, this makes a fantastic ice bag.<br /><br />I was a little surprised when this bag arrived as it is a little smaller than I expected. When unfolded and filled or just stood up it is a little bigger than a basketball. I had an image in my head that it would be bigger, like the size of a book bag or similar. This is not a very large bag but it does hold more than a gallon of water at a time, if you are so inclined to fill it with that much water and try to carry it.<br /><br />The whole bag is made of nylon though there are three different types used. The outer shell is a parachute nylon which makes it very strong and also water resistant. The inner lining is a microweave type that holds liquid very well and is also very lightweight. The handle is a heavier type of nylon and is strong enough to hold the bag when it is full.<br /><br />The product description says this bag will hold water so it can be transported from a source to a campsite or similar scenario. I found another good use. It is not a huge bag but it is larg enough to hold several soft drink cans and ice. So, filling this bag with ice and then putting in drink cans, you can keep a small number of cans cold and not drip water all over when the ice melts. This is a good option for when you are cooking out or you are having a small gathering and need to keep a few drinks cold without digging up a cooler.<br /><br />This is an exceptionally lightweight bag and it compacts down very small. It is small enough to fit in a large pocket when it is completely folded up and packed in the little bag in which it comes. I have not put the bag on a scale but it definitely weighs less than a pound.<br /><br />This is an interesting little bag. It is definitely waterproof and while it is marketed as a bag for carrying water it does serve some other uses too. It is small, lightweight and well-made.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.",

The straw is too small for me also, but it appears to be well made and fits in the bottle holder on bicycles and fits well in cup holders.  It's really easy to clean and the seal is really good.  The little green piece in the picture was already off when I got it, but it snaps back into place on one of the hinges.<br /><br />It works great with hot and cold beverages which is a big plus.  It's too small for my water but works great for a hot drink to take with me on a cold day.  Only problem is I don't really like drinking hot drinks out of a straw.  The internal part of the straw is detachable for cleaning which is really helpful.  Some people will truly love this and some will hate it depending on their exact taste in thermos's and drinking habits.

            "question": "title: Paddle Your Way to Fitness and Recreation\ntext: If water sports are to your liking, then the Sevylor Mesa Paddle Board is something to consider. It can be used on any body of water- including the ocean- for a hours of fitness and recreation.<br /><br />A paddle board isn’t something many people have ever heard of, but it’s like a cross between a surfboard and a paddle boat. You stand on the board, like you would with a surf board, and then paddle like you would with a boat. Paddle boards are designed to accommodate the needs of a person who is standing and rowing, making it unique among non- powered water craft.<br /><br />As for the Sevylor Paddle Board, it is made with beginners/intermediate users in mind. The board does not come in a long box- it is folded up in a square box and has to be inflated to use. I was surprised at how heavy the box is, but it’s because there is a lot of material inside and the board itself is very thick. Once inflated, the board measures about 2.5 feet in width, which is wide enough to allow for comfortable standing and maneuvering. The fact that the board is inflatable makes it much easier to transport and carry around. Just deflate, fold it up, and you can take it or store it almost anyplace.<br /><br />A flat board would not seem like something that would be stable in open water, but the Sevylor Paddle Board is quite remarkable in this regard. On a lake with few or moderate waves, it’s as steady as a canoe or paddle boat- perhaps even more so. The surface where you stand is slip- proof and with the three fins, one is removable, for better handling when you need it. I cannot comment on how this board would be in the ocean because I haven’t used it there, but it seems like it is well suited for that purpose.<br /><br />Water sports are great for fitness and recreation and paddle boards are a nice way to experience the water without much worry. Sevylor Mesa Paddle Board is a very good board for the needs of most people, excluding perhaps the more advanced paddlers among us. It has the features you need for an enjoyable day of water recreation.",

As a woman I can appreciate the intermediate size of this basketball and think it would be great for women or teens. It measures 24 cm (L) x 24 cm (W) x 24 cm (H).<br /><br />This is a microfiber composite basketball that has good bounce and it arrives complete with a hand pump and needle (There is an extra needle inside the handle of the air pump too). You will need to add some air to the basketball when it arrives. It bounces best when totally full of air.<br /><br />I'm happy with this and think I'm going to take my husband to an outdoor court so he can show me his talent with basketball. He has been showing me the correct way to catch and throw the ball. I must say he knows a lot because he played basketball a lot in his life.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",

            "question": "title: Well Made and Works Great\ntext: One of the things I enjoy is using a monocular or a pair of binoculars to look at distant objects, whether I am birdwatching, looking at a mountain feature or stargazing. I was very interested in trying out this spotting scope and seeing how well it would improve my ability to see things in the distance and I have been more than pleased with it. It works very well and it is a very simple to use and understand device.<br /><br />I should mention that this is a much larger scope than I expected. When measured from end to end it is about 13” long which is a lot bigger than the monocular I use. I was expecting something 6”-7” long so when it arrived it was quite a shock.<br /><br />This is a sealed and nicely waterproofed scope, covered in a smooth no-slip coating that actually feels somewhat velvety (I am not sure how else I would describe it). It has a cap on either end to protect the lenses and it is comes in a nice nylon bag that keeps it free from dust and water when not in use. Overall, it is a nicely packaged unit.<br /><br />The cap on the larger lens merely pops off, but the cover for the eye piece is a large cap that screws down over the whole eye piece assembly. I like this, as it provides additional protection for the eye piece assembly. The larger lens is already protected by the barrel of the scope.<br /><br />This scope comes with a small but very sturdy tripod. It is suitable for use when on the ground or when the scope is on a desk or windowsill. If you want, this scope can be mounted on a photography tripod as the mounting shoe is the same for both. So, with the exception of not having a view finder, this scope can be used as a telescope.<br /><br />The focus adjust is a knob on the barrel and it is easy to fine-tune the focus and get it perfect for objects that are not too close. In playing with the scope I was unable to focus on something across the room but I was able to point it out the window and get a very clear picture of the tree line behind my house. The eye piece has a further adjustment for magnification and rotates to give more or less magnification as desired.<br /><br />I took it to work with me as I work with a couple of people who are very much into optics and would be able to give me a quick assessment. One of them looked it over and tested it a bit and finally came back with “that's a very nice scope” which is a big compliment coming from him. Working on the fourth floor of an office building I set it up on a window sill and pointed it out across the parking lot and focused on a car somewhere between 200 and 300 yards from where I was standing. Once I had it adjusted properly I was able to read off the license plate of that car.<br /><br />Encouraged by that I decided to put it through a real test – I pointed it at the moon. With my telescope I can see the moon's craters so I was hopeful I could see the same with this scope. Not only could I see the craters, but I was able to see them a bit more clearly that with my telescope.<br /><br />I am very pleased with this scope and I look forward to using it more. I have family that lives in the mountains and I think taking this scope with me when I visit will provide all of us some really nice views of the surroundings as we hike and explore.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

It is conveniently collapsable so when no in use it fits into a nice narrow crevice somewhere out of sight.  But when assembled for use the three prong base locks securely to hold your bike aloft at whatever height you need while servicing.<br /><br />The adjustable arm can lock and swivel to tilt your bike forward to keep the front wheel from turning or move the frame to a more comfortable position over the splayed stand feet.  The tool tray on the stem is pretty small and sort of useless but I find when changing between allen keys or other small tools I do use it.  The locking mechanisms are just plastic knobs you can hand tighten but for most of the work I'm doing I find they are enough to hold my bike aloft and securely in place.  Mostly the stand is just holding your bike aloft so you can get at it, it will still sway and have some motion while locked in place but not an absurd amount.  Will you have to readjust or retighten the knobs while working, probably, but again, this is an affordable and occasional mechanics stand, not a pro's stand.<br /><br />Changing my bottom bracket, swapping a derailleur, threading a new brake line.  I've done all of these things with this stand and it's served me just fine.

I've wanted a Fitbit for years, I've heard nothing but amazing things about it and how great they are. Well, to be honest, I am not seeing the greatness of them now that I actually have one. Maybe it's because this is the newest one, maybe there are still bugs to fix, and maybe it could be my phone that just hates everything about the Fitbit app. Honestly, I don't know but either way, I am so unimpressed with this Fitbit.<br /><br />The pros I have found out is that it was easy to set up and make an account with Fitbit. Everything downloaded, updated, and whatever else perfectly. It was easy to change all the settings and personalize everything the way I wanted it. I love that you can customize the face so that it matches your personality or the types of apps or stuff you want it to show first right on the face. I like that you can control your music and pay for your watch too. Those are great ideas and honestly if I got out more and whatever else I can see where tons of people would totally get so much use out of it.<br /><br />My biggest beef I have with this though is the fact that I wear it constantly and I want to keep up mainly with my steps, how much I move, and my sleeping patterns. It doesn't have any problems keeping up with all of that and so much more. The problem I have with this watch is the fact that it disconnects from the wifi and then becomes difficult to sync to the app, if at all. I've already had to reset to factory settings once to get it to reconnect to the app, which also has its own set of challenges because once the watch goes the app doesn't want to do much either. I can't remove the watch to re-add it in the app and I'm unable to view the wifi connections to change them or re-add them. It's like everything stops and becomes completely unusable. It's a real pain, to say the least.<br /><br />Being completely honest, the watch I replaced with this Fitbit was way better and I never had any issues with it syncing to my phone, the app, or anything else. It did everything that this one does but just not as pretty, which honestly I'd much rather the watch to work and do what I want it to do than to have the cool face and whatever else.<br /><br />I am so unimpressed and honestly bummed about this watch not living up to the hype. I am hoping that everything works out and the bugs are fixed soon if these are bugs, but I've no idea. Right now the watch is acting up again and honestly, I am thinking I am about to have to reset it again. If this happens I am going back to my old one that I know works just fine. Honestly, don't waste your money on this one just yet but wait to see if the bugs are fixed in a few months.",

As I have had time to use and play with these 5 different Joola Ping Pong paddles, I must say that they are all incredible compared to any other Ping Pong paddle I have ever used. The quality and performance far exceeds my previous experiences.<br /><br />Each of these paddles have been designed for a specific purpose which include speed, spin and control. Now not being a professional, I can not “honestly” say that I notice the difference between any of these five different paddles, in any of the different design aspects while using them. However, I can honestly say that visually I can tell the difference by the different rubber padding (sandwiched between the inner and outer rubber) used in each. Some have a slightly different thickness, weight, color and I assume different “springiness”. With that said, each and every one of them have performed absolutely stellar in every way for my, and my family’s play style. Personally they all have incredible spin, speed and control capabilities. They are all built with beautiful build quality, and designed with comfort and balance in mind. I especially love the resin looking inlaid logo at the end of the handles. I realise that it doesn’t make a performance difference but it just ads to the overall beauty and gives each paddle a quality looking finish.<br /><br />Overall I feel quite privileged to have had the opportunity to use and experience the Joola brand and share my opinions, though I feel absolutely unqualified to have done so. Just know that if you have never used or played with a “quality” Ping Pong paddle, you are truly missing out, and this Joola brand will be the only brand I choose from here on out!

In the updated photos I have included you can see the new hammocks outside in a carport. Great place to test them sleeping externally while having close access to the home should they wish to go inside. Yes dear old dad slept outside with them. We even slept out side on xmas eve looking for Santa. Luckily he was smart enough to wait till they had fallen asleep. Which honestly took less time than there beds inside. Even with an outside temp in the 30's<br /><br />With the appropriate gear you can use your hammock year round. We do!<br /><br />Original :<br />I absolutely love this/these hammocks. They have a wide range of colors to choose from. We purchased 4 over the last year. A single, Double and Double deluxe.<br />The singles were for our kids and the double and deluxe were for the wife and myself. Truth be told I didn't realize I had a deluxe till after the purchase was complete. Oh well. I love the extra fabric of the double and the deluxe. The double safely held myself and my bouncy husky with no problem. One just bedded down and slept another well he wasn't having anything to do with it.<br /><br />We purchased the wall hanging mounts and setup ours for use while indoors too. What better way to introduce 2 kids to hammock-ing slowly. Lets just say they slept better in their hammocks than in their own rooms.<br />I found out rather quickly why even a slow gentle breeze cools you down. So, we added in our sleeping bags and were toasty all night. Our next adventure the outdoor test with the kids. It will be their first outdoor sleeping. Heres hoping that goes well for this dad.<br /><br />When out doors I would highly recommend a set of [[ASIN:B00MX4FZ9M ENO Eagles Nest Outfitters - Atlas Straps XL, Hammock Suspension System, Black]]. They are used to string the hammock between trees, its much easier than anything else like rope. I look forward to many years of continued use out of all our purchases.",

Every time I get away from it all, I always end up on the water. Before, I was relying on very large plastic bags. I didn't like this very much because it left my belongings visible to everyone, and it also looked tacky. However, I was primarily concerned about keeping my towel, clothing, shoes and small personal belongings dry. Now, I can keep all of my belongings dry in a nice bag that was designed for these situations. This is a worthwhile order for me. I no longer am self-conscious about the lack of style of my waterproof luggage and everything is concealed for privacy. My bag is yellow, so when I leave it on the beach as I step into the water, it's clearly visible to me. I recommend this for the value of use and security of my belongings.

I only use this on in-town rides - never more than 50 miles - so I'm not too worried about roadworthiness. E.g. today I rode my old school MTB - AKA the grocery bike - to my favorite chinese restaurant and took a spoon from home, a tupperware, and a plastic grocery bag for my leftovers. This bag/rack combo is perfect for that kind of thing. If I were planning a trans-continental, epic trek I would aim higher, just because the brand is unfamiliar and the feeling of the materials and construction is budget-minded.<br /><br />BTW the rack I mentioned needs modification to work without snagging shorts - the stock length bolt sticks out too far and needs to be trimmed - but it's an easy fix with seventh-grade-level shop skills.",

I expect them to be lightweight, even when filled. This is the only water bottle I've ever owned that meets all of my expectations. No, it is not insulted, and yes, it does \"sweat\" sometimes. But I live in Las Vegas, so I use these CONSTANTLY. I've never had any problems with leaking, breaking, or anything else, and since I'm a community college prof, I put these through some pretty heavy use between carting them in backpacks, totes, and luggage and knocking them off desks.

(I do wear a 12 in women's, so I'm way above average there.)<br />So next, I try my 4 year old's shoes. You'd think I could use the smallest straps, being that he's in a toddler size 10. They were still too tight. I switched and used the 4th and 6th-8th straps (meaning the longest/largest straps) and I think they will work on his shoes. I got the boot on with a little work and I know I won't be re-tying, so that's awesome.<br />Overall, it's hard to believe these work for any adult shoes, especially when needing more than the longest 3 or 4 straps.

            "question": "title: Everything Needed is In the Box; Smaller than Standard Size\ntext: My family loves family game night though most of the time we have kept it to board games and (occasionally) air hockey. We've wanted a ping pong table for a while as well as foosball table but have lacked the space for those. This table is the answer. However, there is an important consideration when choosing this (or similar) multi-game table.<br /><br />This is a mostly pre-assembled game table; just fold out the legs, drop in the foosball poles, add the handles for the foosball game and you're ready to go. Change the top tier for the game you want and you have multiple games at the ready. It has seven games available - foosball, air hockey (more on that in a minute), shuffleboard, bowling, ping pong, backgammon and chess.<br /><br />I was curious about how the air hockey function would work since this is a non-electric table and there does need to be air to make the puck float. As it turns out, the magic is in the puck. It's USB-rechargeable and it generates enough air flow around itself to glide sufficiently on the table to work. We have an air hockey table that plugs in in the basement; I haven't tried this puck with that table but want to try it to see if it works good with that table too.<br /><br />All of these games are great. There is one important consideration though. The games are smaller than a standard table. That is, this is not a full-sized ping pong table, foosball table, or air hockey table. I am not sure about the bowling or shuffleboard games - I have never worked with these before. And the backgammon and chess table doesn't have a \"standard\" size unless you're playing in a tournament.<br /><br />Other than the size we have been enjoying this table quite a bit. It has brought out the competition in all of us and we have really appreciated having the variety without having to chew up large amounnts of space. The size is actually an advantage in one distinct way - because it is smaller, the table is lighter than if it had been a full-sized one and as such is a lot easier to move when we need to put it in a different room.<br /><br />Everything needed to play is in the box - ping pong balls and paddles, a foosball ball, full set of chess pieces and more. This is a complete set and requires nothing else.<br /><br />We're very happy with this table game set and plan to play heavily. With the variety of games it provides, and all of the equipment included, this is a good bet for the competitive family. Just keep in mind that the size is smaller than standard.",

In order to fit into storage/carry pouch- you’ll need to undo a few moving parts.. not ideal! Especially if your hands are full and kids are tired, cranky, hungry, sunburned… and less then helpful in readying to go!! (sound familiar.. or is it just my cranky crew?!) I want fold and carry, sort of one and done! Last trip I decided to carry back to car and fuss with folding later.. (Hmm, yes I was that girl!) heaving a heavier chair back to the car I found it wasn’t easier.. and the weight isn’t the lightest!! Next time I’ll fold it before I go- I promise.<br /><br />Heavier weight equates to the solid foundation and materials used. This has integrity and doesn’t field to give way under weight of user- at 140lb. I had 28lb toddler on my lap climbing.. and chair was a solid 10. Husband used as well- he’s 210lb. and had same results.. just note the integrity is there.<br /><br />Loved the extra perks! A functioning drink holder.. able to hold hydro.. cushioned arm rests.. and sleek colors with matching bag- better price point under $50. Being of lower profile I appreciate ability to set at the waters edge and let h2o lap onto feet to cool you off. Height is great for kids and shorter peeps (being only 5’1” I qualify!) But, as low as this is.. it may be problematic for elderly or any knee or back issues- something to keep in mind.<br /><br />Overall- it’s a solid with far more perks vs. quirks.. If configured more user friendly/easy to fold up with total ease.. this would be a total home run!!! Planning to use a lot this summer- so I’m sure I’ll perfect my skills..

            "question": "title: UPDATED after beach week, real world use.  Best cooler for $$ Read full review\ntext: UPDATE AFTER VACATION;<br />the best thing about this cooler for longer trips, its dry ice ready.  We spent 15$ on dry ice, used the divider (frozen) and our ice didnt start to melt until day 6 on the way home.  This cooler worked as well as the Yeti for 3x less money.  I'm so happy and proud of my cooler I use it almost everyday.  Our beach trip was a total success and we saved 6$ a day on ice at the minimum.  Perfect cooler for everyday use, beach, river, lake and just about any time you need. Plenty of room and easy to clean.  A must buy<br /><br />Update, 1st use breakdown.<br /><br />Did NOT precool cooler, Used Grizzly Brand ice divider (owns Kenia coolers), and my cans were pre chilled in fridge.<br />I only used 1 half of my cooler using the frozen divider.  The other half stayed empty.<br /><br />10lbs ice 1st day ( rd side ice machine which isnt the best ice and melts quick)  after 36 hrs I only had around 2 cups of water because the divider was refreezing the water as it melted against the divider and along the bottom of cooler.<br />Day 3 I added 20lbs of frozen ice. Still only half of cooler.  Didnt have but a quart or so of melt off by this point and divider was half melted.  The ice last 2 more days before I drained 1.25 to 1.5 gallons of water from cooler and had maybe 7 lbs of lightly frozen ice left.<br /><br />This cooler is awesome from my use and my experience with using it.  Today I've added  20lbs of ice NO divider and using entire cooler and I still only have a cup of water.  Temp is 80 degrees constantly and 15 hrs have gone by already.  This is still the rd side machine ice, as I said before in a normal cooler 20lbs will melt within 20 hrs for sure by next morning it's all water.  With the Kenia cooler I have easily doubled my ice time if not almost tripling it.  And I'm not freezing the ice in a freezer before use.  If you freeze this crap ice before use, it can last 4 or so days.  If u freeze ice in deep freezer I'm sure it will last even longer because of the - temps with deep freezer.<br /><br />Well worth the money spent and saved vs a 600$ equivalent yeti.  This cooler will pay for it self over 40 total days,  5$ or more per bag ice, 1 bag per day 200$...  paid for that quick. At least with my old coolers this is what I was having to do, either 6$ bag ice from store or 2 rd side bags @4$ per day.  Every day and during our Southern 100 degree days I was having to do this twice a day.  So by far this cooler out last most on market.<br /><br />Now I added 20 lbs of frozen freezer ice to that 10lbs, didnt drain the water.  The ice lasted 4 days.  I hope this helps someone make the right choice for the money.<br />We have a beach trip planned in few months and another updated test results will come after that trip.  That test will be outside in middle summer outside 16+ hrs a day in direct sunlight.  Will update after words to tell the world.<br /><br />Look 5 stars even though ITS LOOKS TO BE USED!!<br />yes it is scratched on top and scuffed on side and bottom and it does not smell like a factory cooler smells when purchased. With the way its wrapped and boxed this shouldnt happen if it was brand new. I could be wrong and issues arise from warehouse worshipping problems. But it seems to be a returned item that has been used at least once.<br /><br />Overall this cooler is huge, thick, and very sturdy!  Cheaper by almost 70% from yeti brand.  I'm very pleased with purchase.<br />The color is absolutely vibrant and eye catching.  I love the stapdown handles and the thick rubber feet on bottom.<br />The inside is just amazing you can tell it will hold heat or cold very easily.<br /><br />I wish there were more accessories available with the 65 quart coolers.. that's my only big issue besides the used look.<br />I bought a rack from yeti hoping to bend it the .1 inch to fit (judging by measurements provide by companies). I have also bought the 5lbs freezer divider so we can keep usable ice seperate from used ice with the dry ice.<br /><br />Camping trip in next few weeks will give a good idea of how well this cooler cools.  Will update at that time and let everyone know how this cooler works in real world settings.<br /><br />I have not been paid for ANY review I've ever left. (I wish I did though) This is, as always, just my opinion through my eyes to help others.<br />If you find this review helpful, please vote, so Amazonian browsers can better learn, research and understand how products work for them.!.

The set includes four clubs including a driver, 7-iron, wedge, and putter. The set also comes with a pink bag. My daughter loves the color of the bag and clubs!<br />Overall, this is a great golf set for a young golfer!",

The [[ASIN:B00HBR41LY #1 Rated Travel Towel and Sports Towel - MICROFIBER - Guarantee Bleed Free - Includes Hook]] is different than any other microfiber towel I've seen and I now understand what the hype is about.  The Pebble and Stone color is lovely and gender neutral, soothing to look at.  The medium size of 24\" x 48\" is ample enough to take on a trip around the world, weighing in at 150 grams or 5.29 ounces without adding bulk.  It is absorbent, quick drying after a gentle wringing, and has a centered fabric hook perfectly sewn into one of the long edges at dead center position.  Most importantly for me, this towel is s-o-f-t and s-m-o-o-t-h, so for delicate skin, it is a winner.  Washable in cold water, it's ideal for a quick wash in the sink and hang over the rack for drying.  Not ready to wash it yet?  You can just hand it for an air out, but I like to keep it clean and not carry around old memories.  I'm quite surprised at how impressed I am with this towel, but there you have it.  It is a good size, feels good, is easy to maintain, and it can be used over and over again without deteriorating.  The Morning Sky and River Blue colors look equally as soothing as this one and I'd be hard pressed to select a single color.  There is a molded Shandali logo impressed into one corner of the towel that in my opinion finishes it off.  This towel was made in China of an 80% Polyester and 20% Nylon blend.  Even the satin label sewn into the edging is quality.<br /><br />I was sent this towel in exchange for an honest review.",

            "question": "title: Golf cart dream item..  if only it could work!!!\ntext: Who wouldn’t love some great tunes on their golf cart..?!! As a family who owns a golf cart yet, has never golfed a day in our life - we’ve spent the last decade doing nothing but, fun rides and adventures all around our planned community with our kiddos on this toy. Music would only enhance this- and give us golf cart karaoke?!!<br /><br />Problem is.. this is a one size fits most. But, it didn’t come close to being “most” for us! How.. when we have the same speaker used in the sellers sample photo description- see photo I included..??!! Right from start when trying to attach we had issues.. this has 6 velcro straps coming out of the sides- (picture a big bug with legs!) Zero instructions included and you'd think this would be straightforward..  Trust me, we tried straps forward wrapping around pole and then, backwards just the same- we even went back to description online.. studied the photo and still had no success.<br /><br />Problems we incurred:<br /><br />•Straps are not long enough to wrap around the pole and speaker- and have enough length to close on themself. (this is placing the speaker in same spot as advertised!)<br /><br />•2 of the 3 sets of straps were sewn in backwards- so, if wrapping around the direction they’re attached- The Velcro teeth on x2 straps are on the wrong side. (Equivalent to getting two negative signs together..) hoping this is an error!<br /><br />•From photo description it appears we are missing a middle extra strap? Photo shows x1 in brown strap thru middle but, we don’t have anything of the sort...??<br /><br />•This has no bottom support or “shelf” for added protection.. this could lead speaker slide at the bottom if it were to become a loose. Golf carts bounce around a bit and vibration may cause this to slip. So, bottom support would be helpful if not, necessary to protect the speaker from falling down  and give the user peace of mind.<br /><br />•This is missing a simple but straightforward set of instructions.<br /><br />overall, this may work with a much smaller size speaker- one with hardly any girth.. Even then, it may be hit/miss to get the securely fastened. I’m afraid a smaller speaker may not produce enough sound to be heard over a motorized golf cart and will it stay safe? In leui of listing this “one size fits all/most..” this would be beneficial to list the actual length and dimension of straps so, one can verify speaker sizes that would work! Listed at a price point of $10- this could be a great find.. if, it could be successful. Tbh, It may be safer to invest more solid option to ensure it will fit/function as expected. I hope this info can help your decision… Feel free to let me know!",

            "question": "title: Better than some more expensive options! (but bumpy- expected for the price, read for explanation)\ntext: I've owned and reviewed a handful of electric scooters, some nearly double the asking price of this one. This is actually quite good, and was more-or-less ready to go right out of the box (very minimal assembly required). It is also very easy to fold for storage and carry, and the clip looking piece on the handlebars is for locking the scooter in the folded position (see photo). There actually isn't any mention of that clip in the manual, so I wasn't sure what it was for until I tried to fold it.<br />There are some things that I like better about this one vs some of my others I've tried. For starters, it is lighter and hits a faster top speed than others in this price range (In real world usage that is- most of these claim to be the same 15mph speed, but in use some are faster than others).<br />I found the speed level settings odd: rather than saying 1, 2 and 3 like other \"gear\" settings, this one uses Eco, D, and S. Honestly, using numbers would have been more intuitive but that doesn't detract from the experience at all. The one thing I really DO wish they did, however, is have air-filled tires for some bump smoothing. You see, one of the big problems with small wheel scooters is that every crack, bump and pothole is exaggerated. I have 2 scooters with traditional inner tube tires that I can take down a certain bumpy road that this cannot easily. To be fair, those scooters cost quite a bit more than this one, so for the price that can't be expected. In fact, this seems to be an excellent value for the asking price right now, so I'd go ahead and give it 5 stars. A quality product for the money. Just know what you can or can't do with it.",

The only difference is the brand name and color of the name on the wrist strap. From the word GEL on the palm to the number of dots on the grippy bits they're identical.<br /><br />Here's that review:<br />\"I'm currently confined to a wheelchair and being a big guy I needed some grip and protection when I'm scooting myself around. These gloves seemed to fit the bill and once they arrived they did. Fit was great. Tight enough to stay in place no matter how hard I'm pushing the chair around but not too tight to be uncomfortable. Finger holes are right sized as well. The palms are incredibly grippy and would work as well on a bicycle handlebars as they do gripping the big wheel of my chair. If I had one complaint it's the palm material is tacked onto the glove and are a bit. . . the only way I can describe it as bulky. When you close your hand tight there's more of the grippy stuff than feels necessary but the majority of the time you don't notice the added padding. As wheelchair gloves these are pretty darn good. I'm not up for riding a bike right now but i can't see how they'd be bad. . .\"",

It requires the use of an app to control it. My husband and my 17 year old daughter have both downloaded and are the primary users. When riding in the house, they were riding on tile, hardwood, and carpet. The Segway moved over all three surfaces easily and without any hesitations. It went over the transitions smoothly. I was surprised at how fast they were able to go inside the house.<br /><br />Once the weather was nicer, they took it outside. We live in a small neighborhood with minimal traffic. They have enjoyed riding in the street as well as the driveway. The app limits the speed based on how much driving you've done. The more experienced you are, the faster you are permitted to go.<br /><br />It has headlights and rear colored lights. You control the hover board with your balance and leaning. My husband says if you think too much about it, it's difficult to control. Instead of thinking about how to control it, he finds it easier to think about the direction instead and has more success with it. I tried to ride the thing once and had difficulties with my balance.

Since it's made of a thinner material than typical backpacks, he was able to squish it easily to fit under the seat and allow himself some foot room. He was able to fit his over the ear headphones, an inflatable travel pillow, a spare outfit (in case his luggage was misplaced), a power bank, his tablet, and a few other items. The material is pretty thin, but durable. All the zippers moved smoothly. He was very pleased with it.<br /><br />*I purchased this at a discounted price for the purpose of trying it out & reviewing.

That is a lot of goodies and use what your level of knowledge and guidance needed.<br /><br />Workout: very effective and I love that fact it is low impact and I had a great work out.

There are three level of resistances that you can work up to, and for me, I am generally weak on my upper body and this workout will really make me focus on this area, whether i like it or not!  The workout works out both core, heart and strength training!  3 in 1!<br /><br />There are not a lot of extra dvds with this tool: 2 so far, so it will be good if they can provide a few more for people like who needs a lot of variety when working out.

We put the zip ties around the handlebar brackets to keep them from coming off on bumps. The bottom bracket uses a flimsy piece of velcro that broke immediately after the picture was taken & was replaced with yet another zip tie.<br />Once we got the mounts firmed up (mostly with a bunch of zip ties), the basket holds well & is useful.

We've only had it in service a few days, but my daughter really likes it (she likes the ability to switch to the Minon watch face, and we've had some \"steps\" competitions).  I purchased this watch as some of the other kids watches are extremely oversized in my opinion.  I also like the simplicity of this watch's design and functions.  My daughter was intuitively able to understand how to navigate through the functions right out of the box.<br /><br />The watch connected to the smartphone app right away and syncing has worked every time without issue.  I think this is one of the best options on the market based on compact size (sized appropriately for smaller wrists), functions (we didn't want a true \"smart watch\", or even one that pretends to be a smart watch), brand name/durability, and price.<br /><br />IMO kids of this age don't need additional exposure to screens or games.  Make them go do physical play and use their imaginations.  The main features we wanted were something that could show the time, a step counter, and a timer.  My daughter uses the timer to make sure she's getting her daily reading minutes in and this allows her to be more autonomous when doing this.<br /><br />I do wish there were more band styles available though.

I appreciate the carry bag they come with but, I do wish it was a bit more accessible (easy to get into) and sturdy. Why can’t they make these just a tad bit bigger- why is the struggle always needed to get the item back in its case?!!<br /><br />I also loved the “cheat sheet” card insert as well,  *reference a closer picture included above. This shows drawings of a few exercise options to help you get started and from there.. you can branch out or, tweak use to best suite your personal workout. **you can google 100’s of workouts using bands and also.. get helpful tips and information that way as well. The cheatsheet will also remind a user which band is what strength/resistance. These are color-coded and marked… However, overtime marking looks too fade and with colors being so similar, it may be harder to keep specifically identified. The card will help! ** FYI- these do increase in resistance in the same order as color scheme (they increase light to dark... just FYI! Adds the best helpful feature for identifying.)<br /><br />I’ve used these daily for about two weeks and they seem to hold elasticity quite well- of course, they get more stretchable like any rubber band mentality.. but, still offer plenty of the resistance needed. So far so good, I haven’t had any of them snap/break and this was my biggest concern!<br /><br />I do recommend using over clothing material vs. bare skin- these can pull at any hair on skin (downy or, otherwise!) and it can hurt!! Certain stretches don’t involve skin contact.. and those are by my favorite by far!!<br />I haven’t used the small mat that set comes with- and Im not sure I would - it feels like it’s made of  “papery plastic”..I’m going to stick to the yoga mat I already have!!<br />I’m not 100% certain they’re is a noticeably large difference between the levels of the middle bands.. But, there definitely is between the first and last amount of resistance in the band.<br />Overall, this is a nice set of exercise bands that has held up and done it’s job without any complaints and at a decent price point.<br />I hope this info helps… feel free to let me know!",

But I found a pair while doing laundry (oddly) and thought to write my review on them now.<br />They're perfect for when I go for a late-night jogging or to the Y. I wouldn't recommend wearing these to work or on casual Fridays. Because they compress the feet, there's not much cushion on the outside to fill the space of shoes. Therefore, it's best to wear these with athletic shoes, which are more form-fitting. They stain like normal socks, but at least when they do the stains look more like rubbed dirt after a wash.<br /><br />The only issue is that they attract fuzz a lot. I'd suggest spraying them with static-removing spray. Otherwise, you'll get a lot of fuzz and hair showing on them.",

The Seeker 2 Pro is the brightest one I have.  It is bright!  They got a ton of light into a small package.  I could repeat the features of this light but the Amazon order page does a great job of listing the features of this pocket powerhouse.<br /><br />One feature of many Olight flashlights is the magnetic charger.  This gives me the ability to recharge either at home or in the car.  The included L dock is very neat.  The belt case seems very well built also.<br /><br />This is my first flashlight that shows both the battery strength and output level right in the button.  The Olight Seeker 2 Pro has a good feel in my hand.  I like the rubberized grip areas.<br /><br />The 1200 lumen output on high is enough for most any need I have.  If more is needed then the 3200 lumen output on turbo is very impressive. This unit can go from 5 lumens ( moonlight mode ) to 3200 lumens ( blinding )  The strobe light should be enough to temporarily blind and disorient an attacker.<br /><br />This is to me, a very impressive flashlight package that I will enjoy for years to come.<br /><br />Update 8/7/2019  After using this light more, I am still impressed with.  It still has a great feel to it.  You can feel the quality in it.  It is amazingly bright, packed with features with great customer service to back up great products.",

I'm impressed, and now I can't believe I've gone camping so many times without anything like this!<br />To be clear- this isn't something you heat over a camp fire, but rather it requires its own fuel (it uses alcohol, which burns cleanly and efficiently). It is really easy to use, and I have to say it boiled water and gave us great coffee out in the woods! I love that we could even use it for hot oatmeal and other things that we normally wouldn't consider having on a camping trip. I'm very happy with this product and would gladly recommend it!",
