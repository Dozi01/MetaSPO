The tape is very strong so that great. I definitely don't agree with the 3 star rating someone else gave. It works very well, again the only reason why I decided to take it off is because I needed white white.. the thing is I guess that's everybody white tone, since I order white from another place with the exact same problem. Can fit on the edge of tables, door frame, counters, cabinet and a lot more.<br /><br />If you don't mind the color being a little off then this will be perfect for you.",

It also might not stay open for little ones to easily place eggs into the bag during a fast paced egg hunt.  The sequins are color changing, but it is difficult to get the color to change from pink to silver because the sequins are a little rough on the hands.  Going from silver to pink is much easier.  The inside of the bag is lined with a yellowish material.  The bottom of the bag is round and pink.

I'm not sure what is clicking in it, but it is a little disconcerting.<br />The lid gets VERY warm. So, if the warmer is full, the wipes on top are too hot to use straight out of the warmer.

To top it all off, the story of the creators of this product brought it all together. It includes an instruction manual and a recipe book. Also, make sure to look for the little card to get your lifetime warranty!<br /><br />This product is very nice. If you leave it sit too long it’s a tad difficult to clean (like anything), but it’s still pretty easy to clean. It is very easy to use, but it does take a little long to make the food. I want to say we walked away and it took about 30 minutes to finish, but we both definitely forgot we turned it on. So if you are looking for something quick, I would not purchase this product. But to make food ahead of time would work well. It is also a little tedious to look up measurements compared to grams and ML. Overall, we are looking forward to using this product more and would recommend it to any family!",

The size is larger than I expected, so older kids can use it as well.<br /><br />For anyone with children on the autism spectrum or for kids with sensory-integration challenges, this bath accessory is very sensory-friendly!<br /><br />In the past, I have also had great success with the Babyfrida nasal respirators which are an ingenious and more effective alternative to those much-hated suction bulbs that are complimentary in every baby first aid kit lol.

It's plant-based, is baked rather than fried, and also includes a small amount of probiotics. Each pouch is a single serving, and is appropriately sized for a child's snack. However, the taste appeal was not all that strong compared with the apple & cinnamon version of the same product. The berry taste of this is quite muted, making it a rather tasteless snack for both adults and older kids.<br /><br />The crunch has good appeal across the board, but there's so little berry taste that made it far less appealing than the apple & cinnamon especially among the older kids (middle school) and the adults. However, the 3 year olds took to this flavor just as well as the apple & cinnamon.<br /><br />The nutritional profile earns  5 stars, but factoring the taste puts my score at 4 stars.

I have the most awkward wall spacing in my manufactured home and I knew I wasn't far off from the days of needing a baby gate, so I would browse and then fail to commit to one. Eventually my little one was mobile and I still hadn't decided, I almost bought another North States gate that would have required a also purchase an extension piece, then by accident I found this one and it's long enough to cover the entire area I needed. Big bonus, this gate was a much better price-point than having to purchase the two pieces. I ordered this immediately, it came on time, etc, etc. Installation went smoothly, and we removed two extra panels we did not need easily. The system for shaping the gate by simply loosening or tightening a plastic piece at the angles is brilliant, and foolproof. We did install it into studs for safety.<br /><br />The gate is perfect. We have had it installed for about 6 months now. It has to endure a family of five, including one toddler, a 13 year old, and a 9 year old. EVERYONE SLAMS THIS THING, but it still works!

Haven't used it outside yet but already really looking forward to using this and it might even end up replacing our larger stroller that was purchased as part of a &#34;travel system&#34;. My husband is 6' 4&#34; and can comfortably use this stroller without hunching over. (At 5' 3&#34; the handles are almost a bit tall for me) Super easy to put together and easy to fold and unfold once you figure out exactly how to do it. Folded up, I'd compare it to the size of a folding bagged chair... definitely bigger than our standard size umbrella stroller but much easier to pack than a traditional stroller. Reclining the seat is a bit cumbersome as I almost have to kneel down to adjust it, but I like that it has multi position recline. Rear wheels have a lock on both and front wheels allow the swivel to be locked as well. The cup holder only snaps on the side next to the right handle so I could see that being accidentally knocked off if not careful.

            "question": "title: The lounger without the Velcro parts is okay; has some holes for small straps - 2.5 stars\ntext: Normally I would say to avoid any type of lounger because infant sleep positioners that include a soft bolster on the sides should NEVER be used for a newborn or young baby due to a risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Consumer Reports has done reviews on such products because deaths have been proven. Also, the FDA site lists the same warning. However, this is more like a flat liner than a lounger. In addition, the bolsters that Velcro on do not stick. They fall off immediately. This should not be used with the bolsters anyway.<br /><br />There are seven strategically placed narrow holes for passing thin stroller straps through this. As long as the baby does not sleep in this unsupervised, it will offer extra cushioning for a stroller or car seat chair.<br /><br />This can also be used to line a pet carrier even though it is an odd size.<br /><br />Overall, it is just okay. It is thin and only lightly padded, which makes it a bit safer than the other baby loungers on the market. If this is what one is looking for, then it will do but to me it is a disappointment. Note that the bolsters are garbage. The current price of $19.99 is average.",

We always run out of space on the bottom of our strollers, so this is great.<br /><br />it is a substantial stroller. There is a lot of room for the baby. Another feature I love is that the bottom can come up so there is a place to support the babies legs while she is sleeping. This is great because I have a baby and I always feel bad having her legs just dangling when she falls asleep in the stroller. This can be lowered for older kids, of course.<br /><br />Now it is not a light/small stroller. It isn't the biggest I've seen but it is not a super light one like some of them are.<br /><br />I love that it is flexible as far as the design. You can turn the seat around so that it faces you. I like this a lot...<br /><br />It has a nice look. Basic black goes with most things and works for a boy or a girl.<br /><br />The handle is pretty high for a stroller. My tall husband really likes this.<br /><br />It seemed comfortable. All my kids tried it out and they liked it.<br /><br />It pushed fine.<br /><br />Overall, it is a quality stroller with a lot of nice features.

It is versatile as a backpack and/or diaper bag. There is one central compartment that can be opened from the back through a small zippered \"access panel\" or from the top of the bag. There are several pockets inside the central compartment.  Also included is the waterproof changing mat.<br /><br />The exterior front has one zippered pocket with three tiny bottle pockets for very small baby bottles. There are also two tiny zippered pockets on the sides of the bag.  The backpack has snaps on either side of the central compartment but the top does not zipper all the way to the end. This means there's a chance things could fall out if the backpack falls upside down when the snaps are not snapped in place. However, that is most likely a rare occurrence.<br /><br />The shoulder straps are not well padded at all; it only has light padding which means this is not as comfortable to carry around as it could be.<br /><br />The pack seems to be made of a material that is water resistant. The zippers on all compartments glide easily but I would not consider them high quality. If the zippers were better, this pack would have received 4 stars from me.

But this product solves one of such problems - the high chair.  Designed for upto 5 years, the very easy-to-assemble (about 10 min), looks and feels very sturdy, quite colorful (without being too \"loud\"), and very easy to clean and adjust.  The tray can be very easily removed even with a baby in hand. The more environmental-friendly materials is an added bonus...Overall, the high construction quality will give you confidence on the longevity of the product.  The listed price can give most a pause.  But, at lower price segmentation, it is unlikely to find a product with similar quality and functionality. At this price point, though, one may be able to find competing brands (Keekaroo comes to mind).  For the price, it would've been nice if at least one or two additional cushion sets with different colors included with the chair.

Its very convenient and keeps all the cleanup contained in one bowl.<br /><br />Best feature - the food processor is _very_ powerful and I don't need to strain foods b/c there are no chunks (I do strain peas to remove shells after processing).<br /><br />The steamer is quick and efficient.  With the steamer basket full, I make about one-week worth of single-ingredient food at a time.  I peel foods and cut into chunks before I steam them.  Holds about 2 small sweet potatoes or two pears or one bag of frozen peas.<br /><br />I store foods frozen in silicone mini-muffin pans (much easier to remove than from an ice-cube tray).<br /><br />This device can be used to defrost food - just pop the frozen food in a small heat-proof bowl first.  But, unless you keep a close eye and check a few times, the food gets way too hot.  Easier to use the microwave for 30 seconds, then stir well to make sure there are no hot or cold spots.<br /><br />I will definitely use this when our baby starts to eat our food and it needs to be blenderized first.  The blade and motor on the food processor are fabulous and better than others we have.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The price is way too expensive.

This is a HUGE inconvenience. I cannot emphasize how many times over the past year I've wished for a simple desktop PC app or a way to view through my web browser. I didn't think it would be as big of a deal as it really is.<br /><br />So anytime the developers don't handle an update, it means the monitor is unusable until they get around to releasing an update. As of today, its been about a week without the monitor.<br /><br />Also, the company's constant answer to nearly every problem is to uninstall the app and reinstall it, which usually works, but is frustrating.<br /><br />Without a working app, you can't see anything, hear anything, or interact in any way with the monitor unit. Again, a huge problem.<br /><br />The speaker quality on the unit is severely lacking. I tried playing through some of the built-in lullabies once and certain ones (with lower frequencies/bass tones) just sounded literally like scratchy noise from a horror movie (great if you WANT to wake up your kid and traumatize them).<br /><br />Using this for an audio monitor again means you need a phone with you with the app active and the volume turned up. If you usually mute your phone at night, you risk end up muting the monitor, too.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: This shouldn't be anyone's ONLY monitor. At minimum you should have a separate audio monitor - we have a DECT one from Philips that has been absolutely rock-solid reliable and gives me peace of mind at night. When I hear the baby through the Philips monitor, I can check on him visually through the iBaby monitor. So it's nice but if I was going to do this all over again I would just buy a camera-only system that was more reliable.",

I'd say that the only bottles out there that are \"harder\" to clean are the MAM bottles, because of how many pieces they contain.<br /><br />In the end,  I think the bottles appeal more to the parent  than the child.  This was really expensive and did not seem the help us with our bottle feeding issues.",

            "question": "title: Such a clever clip.. helps with stroller and SO MUCH more!!\ntext: Loving these- Such a cleaver idea for anyone needing a third hand or, extra space. Let’s face it- tiny newborn babies come with an insurmountable amount of baby gear!!<br /><br />So easy.. I placed this onto the U-shaped handle of our baby stroller..  To do so, is simple and straightforward. Think little hinged carabiner- and supersize it.. Boom!! Works the same. NOTE: there is “click locking mechanism“ on this, once in place-<br /><br />I chose to cover a small section of handle with coban medical wrap.. I didn’t want metal from the clip to scratch stroller handle AND.. it also helps keep clip in place and from slipping down the side. Part of clip I’d covered with padding.. but, they do have a tendency to turn.. not a big deal- just extra Precaution! *Hack- if you have same issue and want to protect handle; several products will work to protect/aid the handle.. I personally chose coban bc, it’s self adhering and has no sticky residue!<br /><br />This set comes with 2 hooks- and placing both on the handle will keep whatever you hang- balanced. But, FYI- you can do this with one clip.. these can handle the weight no problem! (and that’s coming from someone who carries in Mary Poppins purse- aka, bigger bc, it holds a lot of things!)<br /><br />TBH- baskets on strollers are not roomy, mine fits diaper bag/blanket.. leaving nowhere to put my purse. I’ve tried using a small backpack to combat the space issue- but, that can get heavy after a period of time.. and/or, obnoxious taking on and off every time you need your wallet! Ha! This clip allows you to hang purse in front for easy access.. Plus, it’s safer to keep it in your line of sight. *Note: this can be used for more then purses, of course! If, you find yourself involved in a shopping marathon- this is a great option to hold and collect your bags as you go along!<br />Best of all- These can be used for SO MUCH MORE than just the stroller fix! I got 2 more already.. and I’ve put them to use as, these are just so handy!! I hung x1 in the garage: it holds the handful of dog leashes.. and helps keep them organized and in x1 place- which is lifesaving!!! I put x1 in my teens bathroom- it’s perfect for securely hanging the toiletry/shaving bag for my son.. Otherwise, this would sit out on the counter and drive me crazy! My daughter who lives in college dorms, asked for a set to take back to school with her.. She wants to use to hang backpacks and such! Sooo many uses!!<br /><br />Hands down, I recommend 100%.. You cannot go wrong!! The ease and convenience provided is fantastic- and the extra options are a total bonus!<br /><br />I hope this info. helps.. feel free to let me know!",

It is a denser salve, so it's a little tough to dig out than other creams, but a little goes a long way, so it does ensure you don't overuse.<br /><br />I was worried the little jar was too small and might not be worth the cost.

There is also another pocket with a zipper to keep stuff you want to keep a little more secure.<br />With all those things in the pockets there is still A LOT of room left in the bag itself, for at least two sets of clothing for 1 year old, 2 pjs, nursing wrap, toys, blankie, small jacket, formula, baby cereal and more, it's actually amazing how much fits in there.<br />There are two pockets on sides of the bags (outside), one I use for wipes, the other for a large sippy cup.<br />Then there is the front pocket which is actually my least favorite, I wish the pockets inside this pocket where a little bigger, but for a smaller baby (less than a year) it can easily hold 3 bottles especially breastmilk bottles which are thinner. I use comotomo bottles so doesn't fit there.

This took about an hour.  Since I have 20 book cases, this is a lot of time.  A much simpler and cheaper alternative is to buy 'L' brackets from a hardware store and screw it to the top of the book case and the wall stud.  Total  time 10 minutes. No unloading or moving the book cases.  Mine are tall enough you can't even see the 'L' brackets.

The strollers wheels get stuck making it frustrating to navigate wherever you go.  Its embarrassing when people hold the door for you and you can’t get the stroller to start moving forward because the wheels are so jammed up.  Never mind that the back set of wheels are really wide making it difficult to get through doorways or department stores.  For the stroller seat, it doesn’t incline well and it is horrid if you want your child to sit up.  They end up slumping to the side since it’s so poorly made.  Oh and the buckles are awful!  You have to thread the top through the sides before clicking into the centre buckle ever time you buckle them in.  The cup holder is a piece of garbage  as is the cell phone holder.

With covid19 around every corner- and quarantine crisis, it’s my job to keep this little guy safe on my watch!!

I keep this at my house if ever needed to go out. As baby grows and carseat adapts.. this boasts the room to do the same!<br /><br />• I am loving the zipper!! WE WANT LIFE EASY AM I RIGHT..?!!! Putting baby in a protective cocoon by just the slide of a zip- it’s so easy to give you peace of mind.. baby can be covered away from any noise, germs, sunlight, dirty hands- and that helps me feel better. It’s also completely easy to do a little unzip… And take a peek. This is helpful without disturbing the little guy!<br /><br />• Material it soft and has ample stretch, it’s washer machine safe. I washed on delicate and chose to air dry.. (better to err on the side of caution the my time) Although, I’ve only washed this x1- it washed and returned to fit with perfect expectations! Sure.. Maybe a tad wrinkly- but, that even seemed to work itself out once stretch back into action!<br /><br />•added security- I’ve found if the little guy is strapped in and fussy- And Just by covering him, removing outside stimulation can help so much.. he can calm himself and feel that security these little punkińs crave!!! After all, let’s face it they came from a tiny, dark, secure place- and tend to find comfort there during hectic surroundings.<br /><br />•Print is universal- I ordered in gray/white arrow print and it is nice, rich color and could be used for both, boy/girl. I realize options could match this item to the specific sex of the baby- however, if you choose neutral you can utilize with any future children- universal works with everyone ha ha.. and with the quality of construction.. I feel confident this would last for more then one baby use!<br /><br />• As advertised, this has many uses- but, in my situation they didn’t apply. My need was very specific.. after reviewing the instructions/options- they seems very straight forward and easy to use! The instructions provided very step by step and user friendly.<br />I hope this info helps... feel free to let me know!'",

I got this because my dog kept going into our entryway to chew up our shoes. This gate was easy to install and it solved the problem.<br /><br />The gate fits perfectly in a standard doorway. It comes with extensions if you need to fit it in a larger space. To mount the gate, you place four plastic pieces on your wall. You can either stick these pieces on the wall or screw them into place. The gate comes with a template which allows you to make markings on the wall.<br /><br />Once the plastic pieces are in place, you insert the 4 threaded spindle rods into the gate and place the ends into the plastic mounts. Then you finger tighten the wheels until the gate is secure. Mounting only takes a few minutes and the gate is very sturdy.<br /><br />The gate latches securely and is very convenient to open and close. This gate features a much more durable construction than other gates on the market. This is an excellent product that is durable, functional, and attractive.",

They have more movability and stretch than any brand of diaper I have used for my kids. And I have used soooo many brands! My daughter (15 months) has had no leaks in these diapers. They stay on and she seems comfortable in them. Me personally, I felt Little Snugglers by Huggies fit her body style a little better than these. She doesn’t have much extra on her so the stretch isn’t needed as much. And they were a little baggy on her. But thinking back to my first daughter who had thicker legs I feel like these would have worked better for her. Need more stretch and give. All in all they work great. They have Mickey on them which is fun! There is def as always a better quality you get with a huggies compared to cheaper and no name brands!",

My nephew, who is pretty darn bright for his age group, ended up flipping them upside down in order to get a better grip and got confused about why the food wasn't staying on them.  The fork issue is that toddlers and small kids don't usually grasp the concept of stabbing a fork into their food in order to get it to their mouths.

You have to dry your kid's face completely. I also tried rubbing it on my hands and then rubbing it on the baby's face, and that didn't work out so well, either. You just couldn't get it thick enough in your hand to spread. You really need to use it directly from stick to dry skin.

They are described as having, \"neutral design blends with home decors,\" and they are indeed neutral - white with a well done narrow bias trim edging of black on white.  They were made in China.  Because their corners are quite rounded, the pads offer less protection than more square corners would, but they can be rolled into a more compact form with this shape.  Since they are very lightweight, they are good for travel and they can also function as a bib or burp cloth when necessary.  I am currently using one for my 12 pound dog to protect her new bed although it's a little small for that purpose.  These pads are not intended to be as protective as the pads we used for Mom for the past few years of her life, nor are they large enough for a typical adult's bottom, but they can be used horizontally underneath the baby's rear as they outgrow the space provided when she/he is positioned on the pad vertically.  They are made very, very well, the packaging and presentation are well done, thereby making this a great item to include in a newborn baby's gift ensemble.  Their size is most suitable for a young infant and they are definitely gender non-specific.  I like them but would prefer they be a few inches larger in all directions.",

This is especially meant for issues like cracked skin and such to help lock in the moisture to allow it to heal.<br /><br />Obviously like with any wound you have to make sure it is clean first since you don't want any dirt in there to cause any kind of infection. Then you just shake it up to make sure it is mixed well, spray on a thin layer, wait a couple of minutes for it to dry and remove the excess from the edges. Don't rub it in or anything since that is not how this is supposed to be used.<br /><br />I found when you use it, it is just slightly tacky to the touch and is a bit flexible just like you would expect and hope it to be or else it would just crack and then you would have no protection again. It is very easy to use really but the layer you get is pretty thin. It does have a tendency to run away before it dries so you really can only apply a little bit. So if you wanted a thicker layer you would have to apply a thin layer at a time. They also recommend reapplying it up to 3 times a day, which to me indicates that they also realize it is not very resilient to normal wear and tear which is what I have found.<br /><br />It works well for a quick making something that is open, add this on it to give it a protective layer for a bit but then that layer does wear off and you let nature just run its course or put a band aid on it. I just don't see myself grabbing to this one much at all unfortunately. Even though it is easy to use it does tend to run off making it a bit of a strategy game to figure out how to place the area in question to avoid run off.",

            "question": "title: Made for the minimalist in recordkeeping..\ntext: This was a gift for a mom who didn’t think she wanted to keep a baby book as, a 38yr old first timer, she didn’t feel the desire. She felt she would record the information via photographs and online keepsake journaling. So, this is where the simplicity of this Particular baby book came in handy! Yes!! Believe it or not there are people who don’t feel the need or desire to scrapbook… And this is definitely for the minimalist in that category.<br /><br />This is not for anyone who likes to keep detailed records, diary or, has a love for spending hours creating pages of scrapbooking, memories and such. This reminds me of a place to put the bare bones 411 that a child may want to know one day.. after all, what child doesn’t like a peek back into their own baby book?!!<br />Pages are single question with an option to answer a writing prompt on a single line or two. There is blank background space that would allow one to add a photo or card, name tag, paper… Even hand/foot prints- IF.. they so choose to use the blank space around the question itself (or, one could even use the back side of pages as, these are single sided.) Yes! This does ask the vital statistics- and for those who doesn’t like to memory keep on paper but, chose to keep a trinket.. keepsake pockets are provided. A minimalist recordkeeping book is best way to define!<br /><br />I appreciate the spiral-bound style book but, one will be careful not to overfill- spiral itself is not The strongest. This is unisex and could be used for either boy/girl and will adequately cover babies first year and anything else.. is just a bonus. I suggest keeping recipient in mind before ordering-<br />To be sure this will fit the need.<br />I hope this info helps… Feel free to let me know!",

            "question": "title: 5 year old was comfortable but forward seatbelt install interferes with Linear side protection (LSP)\ntext: This is definitely a nice car seat. My 5 year old (42 lbs and 44 inches tall) fit in this just fine.<br /><br />My experience:<br />- Crotch strap didn’t sit too close to his genitals. He never complained about it hurting him.<br />- Seatbelt lockoff is simple to use, thread belt through, tighten strap and pull upward to lock into place. No issues tightening down seatbelt or getting seat in position as to not move more than 1 inch at belt path. Actually one of the easiest I’ve used. Seat cover pulls forward easily to see belt pathand lockoff.<br />- Since my son is over 40lbs, the latch system can no longer be used. Seatbelt must be used to install in forward facing harnessed mode.<br />- The LSP system (linear side protection) which states that it should only be used with an outboard seat and only on the side closest to the door interferes with the seatbelt. While the seatbelt is in lockoff it lays over the LSP on the side of the seat (see photos) which caused some slack in the seat belt and if the lockoff were to fail the seat belt would loosen. I didn’t like that.<br />- Underneath the seat pad has storage specifically for latch system, which is push button style, not like the tether type clasp.. Very easy to use.<br />- Harness straps do not have to be removed when converting seat to booster mode. They sit behind the padding so they don’t get misplaced.<br />- SensorSafe plugs into the OBD2 connector in your vehicle and emits a series of beeping noises when you turn the car off. This could be an issue for anyone with a sleeping infant in a rear facing seat. Good idea if you are worried about possibly forgetting your child in the car. Not so great idea if you don’t want a cranky infant because the sensors woke them up mid snooze. Personally, I do not value this aspect but for busy moms or not usually part of the routine dads, this could be super helpful.<br />- The magnetic harness clip holders probably won’t get used. This isn’t a feature I would put high on the list. Maybe for an infant this would be useful but not for older children close to booster transition.<br />- Most car seats have an expiration 6 years past the date of manufacture. This Cybex  seat does not expire for TEN years. That’s a long time to not have to buy a new one!<br />- 6 recline positions, arrow on side on seat shows position selected.<br />- No rethread harness. Easy handle under headrest allows you to easily move up and down with height.<br />- Headrest has 3 positions to recline back and forth as to allow your child’s head to rest up against it without slumping over when they have fallen asleep.<br /><br />Personally, I find an infant carrier style car seat easier and more convenient  for the first 5-6 months. This would be great for a child at 5-6 months old. At that age, you’ll know this seat will probably be the last one you’ll have to buy for your child.",

It is also compatible with click connect car seats. This stroller really had engineers think about what is needed for growing families. Each seat can hold up to 50 pounds. A child up to 50 pounds can also stand on the platform and baby can either face them or face the world. The first seat can turn into a bassinet when you want to use the stroller as a bassinet. You have 11 ways to position the kids to most suit you and your children. The canopies are big and do a good job at keeping sun off baby and a second child in the second seat. Just with the out of the box stroller, you have 11 different configurations for strolling your children. With the addition of the click connect car seat, you have 11 more configurations. You will love the one hand fold. It is a bit on the heavy side at just under 23 pounds, but it is able to do so much that you will love it. As your family grows, this stroller can be extended by 11 inches! How many stroller do that?

We purchased this mattress when we bought our son's crib just before he was born from Babies R Us. He didn't actually sleep in his crib until he was 6 months old. Before he turned 2, there was already a terrible sink hole in the middle of this mattress. I contacted the company since it is supposed to have a 10 year warranty. After a long battle with them, I finally got a free replacement mattress. Now that replacement is in the same shape as the original one was and my son just turned 4 years old. He is still using his toddler bed, so now I have to buy another mattress for him. We should NOT have to go through 3 mattresses in 4 years for one child. That is crazy!

            "question": "title: A good small light weight mosquito net\ntext: This net has helped my DD to sleep well at night. She is a mosquito magnet. They don't bother me. I rarely get bitten but if there is one within 100M she will get bitten multiple times. The price was reasonable and it was very easy to install. No bites since we put it over her bed at night.<br />Now for the critique. The net does not close well over a twin daybed so we have to tuck the ends down on the side. I feel it would fit well over a regular bed with only a headboard, but hers is a daybed and we have to stretch it over the frame. The net hits the ground, Barely. It Might be more of an issue of how small the hoop holding it out more than the design of the net. Second quibble, it is Very easy to pull the long cord loose. Since it is only a friction button over a thin nylon cord (not a loop or tie) if she hits it at night she has pulled the canopy down low over her bed in her sleep just by rolling and catching the net. This isn't a horrible issue for us, but I do have to adjust the height most evenings. I will be swapping out the cord for a more secure and stable loop.<br />However, the product is sturdy and help up to multiple catches, a dog jumping on it (its a mini poodle so not heavy) and other things that have snagged and ruined other nets. I love the ribbon edge finishing on the openings. Much better than a surged edge. And if I were traveling the button friction hold is a good idea rather than a fixed loop you tie. Overall this is a great product, with only a few minor issues.",

            "question": "title: Hardware-wise Probably the Best All-in-One Solution - ADDING a Star for Good App Update!\ntext: This is five star hardware. Video, audio, and air quality monitoring are great, and my original review focused on that.  I deducted one star because the apps were not so great, and it was hard to do anything without getting hit with a sell trigger for Withings' &#34;enhanced&#34; monitoring. I even bought another unit.<br /><br />And there's where the &#34;air quality&#34; starts to get funky. I signed up for the free trial of the enhanced monitoring but I could not get it to work. There's no ETA on when it is supposed to work, either. Hopefully by the end of the free trial, I guess. UPDATE - The most recent app update fixed a lot of what was wrong with the enhanced monitoring. It is not perfect, yet, but it is getting there.<br /><br />To put this in perspective, this is much better hardware than the Canary, the WeMo cameras, and the D-Links.<br /><br />Belkin Wemo cameras are not as high quality, but they set up easily, and their customer service and apps are user friendly and well-adapted to their intended purposes. They also add features - even for older cameras - in their updates.<br /><br />D-Links cameras and apps are not easy to use, but their customer service is excellent.<br /><br />Arlo (Netgear) is the easiest and best of all. Customer service is A+ level. If it had audio and air quality sensors, it would be perfect.<br /><br />The bottom line on the Home? The hardware is terrific, but the actual monitoring does not work as advertised.  Yet. It IS getting better! Good enough that I am keeping both units I have and probably buying a third.",

In the past, I’ve used a towel or a rug to try to save my knees. Those things work, but this is much more comfortable, and with the added bonus of an arm rest, sure beats a towel. If you’re going to leave it on the tub, the pockets are nice for storing toys. If you’re using only occasionally, that’s probably not as important, but what is maybe important is that the pad is quite compact when folded. Good quality.",

            "question": "title: More comfortable like a wrap, easy to put on like a structured carrier.\ntext: I've used a bummer of wraps and even though i love the comfort,  they are so complicated that I can't wrap my baby without watching the video,  which means if wet are going anywhere i put the wrap on first and wear it without baby under my seashell until we get to our destination. Maybe I'm dense but i don't know how ladies do wrap carriers without enough sleep to think clearly.<br /><br />Because of that,  I've relied on soft carriers like the ergo and lillebaby because you just put them on and they work.  This jj Cole one combines both in an inexpensive carrier that I like, but that had some obvious dumb design flaws which make it less comfortable,  though not less functional.<br /><br />You basically put it on like a softy structured carrier,  and put baby in like you would a wrap. Is pretty self explanatory,  unlike my lillebaby which took twenty minutes to set up!<br /><br />I like the wide and comfortable piece of fabric acrid the back. It distributes weight well and avoids issues of the straps falling off or being to be crossed or adjusted. However,  i think it could have come down even lower on my back for a mild improvement in comfort.<br /><br />The real thing i dislike is the back of the waist strap and the arm straps that tighten one of the front pieces. While the waistband in front is generously sized,  for some reason they have this skinny strap that cuts into your back fat in back. It would be so much better if that were a wide,  padded strap with lumbar support like so many carriers.<br /><br />The under arm,  side straps are the same. I was feeling ok about my postpartum body until I saw how much these straps dug into my plump places. Not comfortable,  not flattering. WHY not pad the straps to distribute the weight??<br /><br />The real test was when I tried my 5 month old girl in it. She was happy as a clam, seemed secure and cheerful,  and didn't fuss for an hour while I made phone calls and did small chores.<br /><br />So overall it gets four stars out of five. It functions well and is about 70 percent as comfortable as my expensive soft carriers, but is a third the price,  which means it's a pretty darn good value.<br /><br />If they'd make the straps wider and padded and add lumbar support,  it would be,  in my view,  on par with high end carriers.",

This is a fun “security blanket“- pacifier holder combo.. its so soft, and cute as can be! The character (and we all know, some of these can get a wee creepy to say the least..) but, this monkey is just stinkiń cute- his little ears and face are absolutely adorable.. and both, blanket and holder have a monkey head attached... Sounds super weird- But, it works! (I included a picture show size as well!)<br /><br />Somewhere along the way I missed expectation of what a “security“ size blanket would be?! I pictured a receiving blanket- only, after seeing in person, it makes sense! These are made for ease, comfort, security and ability to tuck in/cuddle up.. Hence, the name!! So, know this is just about size of a burp cloth (or, a kitchen dish cloth.) these aren’t made for warmth/coverage in any way... got it! It may be nice if you can “assign” what will be their go too.. at least for a little bit- The size may be nice with all the other paraphernalia you must bring along.. and the familiarity for infant will bring added security- ha!!<br />My own kiddos, always fell in love with their “gi-gi” but, it was from a blanket we used and they’d naturally come to prefer. Which btw- always was biggest or, most obnoxious to lug around- Ha! (ie. My son fell in love with the hot pink/lime polka dot..made for his sister. So, he went to college with it- hidden in his pillowcase!!) With this blanket, you can pick color/animal and it is soft enough to become a favorite.. *The corners with the tied knots, I’m sure will be a favorite!! We know how much they love to stimulate with their fingers..<br />we picked the monkey as a gift for my nephew, his daddy is a native of Ghana- and used decor of an African safari.. so, this was a hit!! Bonus, color won’t show wear/tear as much so.. love the brown- it looks so good on his skin tone!<br /><br />The material/softness gets better over trips thru the washing machine.. I’ve watch our little guy x2 wknds and washed it daily.. (corona virus is out right now and I must keep baby germ free...) Each time I retrieve from dryer- he looks/feels softer!<br /><br />TBH, I’m not 100% certain how much use the pacifier holder will get? I appreciate you can swap out the pacifier provided. Only, the weight of animal seems to pull/dislodge pacifier from babies  mouth- Also, the Velcro may be failing bc, of excess washing? **Hack: last time he was here, we hooked little monkey to car seat handle by his Velcro tab.. Looks super cute and as he grows.. it may entertain him?!<br />I wasn’t impressed with packing this came in.. it looks like grocery store wrapping! I suggest taking out of plastic wrap and putting in cute gift bag.. for the price point- I feel this should be in a nicer packaging. But, it’s an easy fix-  So, if looking for a fun baby gift or, addition for your baby- this is sweet and could be a really loved security blanket for any infant!<br />I hope this info. helped.. feel free to let me know!",

            "question": "title: Will be great for the first few months... But, what about when they get active?\ntext: I wasn't exactly sure what I was getting into when I ordered this Baby Monitor, Smart Baby Sleep Monitors with Mat by Derson. Quite honestly, I don't think the concept will work for a 3-4 month old, let alone an 18 month old.<br />It works well now, and gives us great security while the baby is still a newborn, and likely during the first few months. It tracks breathing and heart rate, which you can see in the app without any issue. It is easy to set up the app, and you get alerts if there is no breathing or heartbeat for 20 seconds. It is plenty loud enough to wake you in the middle of the night.<br />My concern comes when the baby starts to move around. No baby is going to lie flat in the cradling nest, on the mat, without moving around. After the first few months, babies start to migrate all around their cribs, so I don't see how this can continue to be helpful after that time.<br />It is well made, easy to use when a baby is a newborn, and the app works fairly well. The time I feel it will be useful just doesn't justify the cost. Especially, when it is designed to only work in such a small area of confinement. It says it will work till age 18 months. I don't see that being even close to possible.<br />This monitoring mat may give us peace of mind for a few important months, but when you are paying for 18 months, it makes a difference. It works pretty well for now, since the baby is still in the first few weeks, and sleeps in the cradling nest without a problem. If that is all the time you are looking to use it, then I would recommend it. Otherwise, invest in something longer lasting from a reputable company.",

            "question": "title: An excellent & adorable anti-drop teether but there is glue around the connection to the rod\ntext: There is one BPA-free silicone teether in this package. The silicone is super soft. I consider this an interesting looking koala that is also engaging. This is easy for the baby to grab and hold onto. It has no sharp edges. There are also nubs on the opposite side to soothe the gums. This is easy for the baby to grab and hold onto. I have given many of these types of teethers to my neighbor's and friend's families' babies and they all love them. In fact, these anti-drop type teethers are a favorite.<br /><br />Note, however, the rod that the baby holds onto in the center is glued around the interior edge on both sides (see photo). Most teethers I've ordered previously have a rod that goes through a hole in the teether but no glue. I do suspect the glue is food safe, as I had a vendor (with a name similar to this one) contact me previously saying they use food safe glue. Also, the baby is unlikely to get this glue near their mouth. Nevertheless, even though I feel this teether is excellent, I recommend supervising when the baby is using this or any teether for that matter.<br /><br />This is made in China and is rated for infants 3 months and older.. The current price of $8.99 is competitive. Overall, I consider this a great teether that is drop-resistant. The baby can definitely drop this if they let go but it is definitely not as likely to be dropped as others.",

The gate stays open until we push it closed, but the latch does not slide home by itself; we have to lift the latch to finish closing the gate. The handle stays up until we push it back down.

My 1 year old ate well from these spoons. They are soft so they are great for scraping the excess food that doesn’t quite make it in. The dip on these spoons is not very deep. So works best with food items that have some sort of jelled formation. Such as yogurt. These are difficult to use with something like soup. So great for thicker purées!!! They rinse off easily and wash up nice. Seem like durable spoons! Probably my favorite feature Is they have a little stand on the bottom! The stand raises the spoon up so you can set it down for a minute without making a mess! Now that right there makes these spoons a win!",

They are durable and freeze well. (And defrost well.) Hubby likes that the top of the bag is wider than Medela, so there's more room and he doesn't touch my milk when opening the bags. He says they are easier to open, too. I like that they have a double zipper, which makes me feel more confident that the seal is truly sealed - so I don't lose my precious liquid gold. I find them easier to close, too. I also like that the bottom of the bag opens wide with ease. With the Medela it took some effort, like trying to open a plastic bag and you can't find the opening. I am buying this product again and it will be my go-to bag. The only thing I don't like, which is why it's 4 stars instead of 5, is that it's hard to write on the bag in the writing area.

This has honestly been one of my favorite and most useful purchases this year. The grandkids love it too. The second row in my suv is two captains chairs, no console. So when the kiddos need to go when we're out and about I just set it up between those 2nd row seats so they can have a little privacy if anyone is nearby. Of course if one goes they all \"have to\" go. But hey, we're already stopped. So no big deal. This little potty is solid. Even the 6 year old has sat on it with no problems. I love how small it folds up so it doesn't really take up space. The Blue Snail bags for the potty are heavy duty. No leaks or drips. I did run out unexpectedly the other day so I grabbed some small (4 gallon) trash bags at the dollar store and they worked too in a pinch, but I've got to say I prefer the thicker Blue Snail bags. The trash bag felt so flimsy in comparison and I don't want leaks on my upholstery. The potty came with a roll of bags and I ordered extras, but the extra bags were at home that day. If you have young kiddos (or little grands like us) this product is perfect. I cannot say enough to express how pleased I am with this purchase. Thanks to Blue Snail for giving me peace of mind (and our littles a place to \"go\") during these uncertain times.<br /><br />** Initial observations... Y'all, I'm obsessed with this little potty to keep in my SUV for my little grands. I didn't feel safe taking them into public restrooms during a pandemic. Gone will be the cries of \"But I have to pee!\" Mamaw has got you covered now babies!! It folds up into the tiniest thing, but it seems very sturdy when open.",

My only gripe is how thin the included bags are. I’d be sure to double bag or get your own thicker bags to ensure the waste is securely contained.

I have had my older kids cut themselves on other seats because of this, so Maxi cosi really did that right! I like the infant head support shape.

Since I can't take several hours out of each day to sit with her, I wanted a more mobile solution and this carrier works great! I can use it as a free standing chair to feed her in or carry her with me while I do chores or take my evening walk. The child harness holds her securely in the carrier and even my vet was impressed with how well it works. I find it very comfortable to wear, especially with the mesh back panel, although I had to play with the adjustments for a couple of days to get the hip belt right. It's also easy to over-tighten the shoulder straps which does make them very uncomfortable and shifts the weight too high. I am 5'6\" 135 lbs and have a rather short torso and I have the waist belt on it's lowest vertical setting so I'm not sure how well this carrier would work for a taller person. Another big plus is being able to carry the puppy's food and other necessities right in the pack. The only drawback that I found is that when the puppy had an accident (she's not completely housebroken) the carrier design neatly funneled all the fluid right down my lower back and legs; something to beware of whatever species you happen to be packing around in it.",

It has helped with my sleep especially when I am traveling.<br />I typically don't like noise when I sleep but there are times when you just need to block out other sounds and this was great for that. I was kind of hoping it would be able to prevent people from hearing inside a room using white noise generation but typically those devices are much more expensive.  I mean it can be used for that but true white noise shouldn't be audible to anyone and this device wouldn't be capable of that.  I really like the lighting it provides and my daughter loved it and has stolen it from me.  I would really like to see them add a downloadable database of sounds that can be added because it has a limited amount as is.  For the price this is a great little device to have.  If you live alone and have trouble sleeping due to strange or unfamiliar noises in the house this would be a great product for you especially if you don't have to worry about security.

            "question": "title: Convenient, but Temperature Readings Can Vary\ntext: Taking temperature can be a pain- no pun intended. If you’re using a traditional thermometer, you have to make sure it’s clean, then hold it in place under the tongue for a while to get an accurate reading. It’s annoying enough when you’re an adult, but it’s even more frustrating when trying to get an accurate temperature for a child.<br /><br />With so much trouble using a traditional thermometer, alternatives are often sought and one option to think about trying is the Braun No Touch Plus Forehead Thermometer. With a device like this, you don’t have to worry so much about sanitation or positioning the thermometer just right in one’s mouth. You just touch it to the head and wait for a readout. Because of the way it works, you can even use it on children while they sleep and, using the built in features, you can check the progress of a fever and see if it’s dropping or getting worse. What could be simpler than that?<br /><br />If this sounds to you like something a little too easy and convenient to be true, well, in some ways you would be correct. The reason I say this is because you cannot always trust the reliability of the temperature readouts. Touch it to someone’s forehead, get a readout, and then try again. The temperature will often change just a little bit. It may not sound like a big deal, but when you’re checking for a fever, every fraction of a degree counts. I noticed that other users have complained about even larger discrepancies in accuracy. I didn’t notice anything like that, but there was definitely a difference and for that reason, I recommend using it a few times when checking for a fever, just to be sure.<br /><br />Other than that issue, this thermometer does have its advantages. The convenience is its strongest point, but I also like that it’s lightweight and ready when you need it. Including something to store it in would have been nice, but I guess I can accept that small oversight.<br /><br />People get fevers and temperatures need to be checked. Braun’s No Touch Plus Forehead Thermometer is an okay device that has many advantages, but is a little flawed in the one quality that matters most: The accuracy of the temperature readout. Still, it is reasonably close to accurate and the convenience and other factors are enough to convince me to rate it average overall.",

I saw a Taggies ball at the toy store and almost bought it, but at $20 I wasn't sure it was worth the money. When I got home and looked it up on Amazon, I saw this one for about $14 and it looked like it had a few other things on it to peek his interest than just tags. So I took a chance and ordered it instead. Out of the box I can tell you its a bit squishier than the Taggies version, I'm not sure if that is a good or bad thing, it might lose shape faster but be easier for little hands to grab, so the jury is still out on that. However, my 8mo old son absolutely loved this the second I handed it to him. So many different things for him to look at and he loves shaking it to make it chime. Which by the way isn't an annoying sound like so many other of his toys. I would definitely recommend this activity ball!",

However, it can also be used as a regular backpack.<br /><br />FEATURES<br />- The front of the bag has one small zippered compartment.<br /><br />- The central compartment has one \"cooler style bottle sleeve\" which does not have a floor, so that it goes through--hence a sleeve. Also, there are two folder pockets on either side of the central compartment.<br /><br />- The central compartment is spacious with room for several diapers and other incidentals.  Due to the squat size of the bag, I do not feel a waterproof diaper pad can be carried in here unless it were rolled up or folded.<br /><br />- The back of the bag has rings for the shoulder straps. Note that the shoulder straps are somewhat long and cannot be cinched too tight. Someone who is really skinny will have the bag fall down near their backside because of the long straps.<br /><br />- There is a snap cloth that holds the handles together.<br /><br />In summary, this bag is durable as the material feels like canvas. It looks like a regular backpack and works like one too but doubles as a diaper backpack. It is very small and perfect for a day's worth of diapers but not much else.

Though aimed for babies, baby lotion is also great for anyone with sensitive skin. I have dry patches on my knees and elbows, so the feel of this is very soothing.<br /><br />While the shape of the bottle is a little unusual, my big thing is that I would much prefer a pump.

I cannot stress the importance of staying on top of cleaning the unit though. You have to clean the part where the formula dispenses into the bottle daily and the rest of the parts need to be cleaned once a month (per manufacturer's recommendations!). If you don't clean it as recommended it sometimes clumps up where the formula dispenses out of, causing the bottle to lack the full desired amount of formula/oz. The water stays heated to a warm temperature. There are different settings to use for different formulas so you need to keep the guide as a reference in case you end up switching formula (like we did). Some have complained about mold in the unit. I have to say that I have had this for almost 7 months now and haven't noticed anything. I do stay on top of cleaning the unit though per the manufacturer's recommendations. The only thing that I don't like is that it only makes bottles in 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 ounce increments. So, if your child takes a 5 oz bottle (like mine currently do) you end up wasting an ounce if he/she doesn't drink it. Luckily, I have twins so we make a 10 oz bottle and split it into two.

            "question": "title: A well-built car seat for small babies, though has a few inconvenient design flaws – love the click connect feature\ntext: This is a serviceable, if not overwhelmingly awesome, car seat for newborns. Since it fits 4 through 30 pounds, it's great if you are planning for a possibly small baby, or prematurity as in the case of many twins. However, realistically speaking many babies will outgrow the height restriction before they reach 30 pounds. My son was 30 inches tall at about 25 pounds. The advantage here is that you are completely covered no matter the birth weight of your child, and it seems to fit newborns snugly - the last car seat that I had back in my first son was born went from 8-35 pounds, and even though he was born at 8 lbs. 8 oz., it definitely felt overly large at the beginning.<br /><br />However, given that my new baby is measuring particularly small so far, I'm glad to have an updated car seat that covers a smaller size baby just in case. I expect that we will move up to a convertible car seat when she has outgrown this one, either in height or weight.<br /><br />I like the unisex design that could be used for another baby in future or pass down to another family with a baby either gender. The seat is lightweight enough that it is easy to carry inside if baby falls asleep or if I just need to run inside someplace for a quick errand, though obviously you'll never want to leave the baby sleeping alone in a car carrier as the position can cut off oxygen as they rest.<br /><br />I hardly ever use the canopy, given that I live in a mild coastal climate, but if you live in a hot climate, you may want to invest in a model that has a sturdier canopy as this one feels a little flimsy.<br /><br />By far my favorite aspect of this is just the click connect feature. I have a click connect jogging stroller, and with my first baby, I had a different brand of car seat. We tried strapping him into the stroller facing forward, and he was terrified of it until about six or seven months old, so I pretty much was stuck carrying him, even if my back was tired. The click connect feature is fantastic, we can use our existing stroller and just set this car seat facing up towards my face so me and baby can commune as we walk. She can get some fresh air and enjoy some of the blue sky and tree line as we walk, and we can converse and smile at one another. The fact that this makes my jogging stroller useful much earlier in the process and eliminates the need for a traditional pram or similar device is fabulous.<br /><br />The car seat was easy to install and adjust, though you should be aware that unfortunately you can only adjust the straps in the back, which is a design choice I'm not a big fan of. However, my last car seat, which was a hand-me-down gift from a close friend, also had that downside, so it's not a dealbreaker for me.<br /><br />Overall, this is a decent if not stunningly great car seat for small infants, I appreciate the lower weight range given that she is seeming small on her ultrasound and that I already own a convertible seat to upgrade her into as she grows, and the click connect feature that works with the whole line of strollers including my existing jogging stroller is a fabulous way of making it easy to bring baby into the grocery store or for walks outside to get both of us some fresh air. While it is a little bit flimsy and inconvenient in areas that don't really matter, the safety and sizing of it seems solid, which is the important thing. And it's also nice that it is gender-neutral.",

I use them for myself now. Due to diet changes, I've been eating a lot more homemade nut butters. I don't want to have to mess with a spoon, especially while traveling, so I needed a solution. These popped up in the search results, and the included funnel sold me on the product vs. others.<br /><br />It's easy to use, and the funnel makes it easier. It's fairly easy to clean, though you might want a bottle brush, or something to get in the corners. Make sure you open the expanding flap at the bottom to fully fill the product.<br /><br />It works well with nut butters as long as they have a smooth consistency and aren't too thick. The picture on the right is homemade sunbutter, which works well with these. The picture on the left is of Wild Friends Chocolate Coconut Peanut Butter, and it is super easy to suck out of the pouch.<br /><br />I've discovered they also work well with yogurt, applesauce, juice, and smoothies, if you're on the go. They would probably work fine with pureed soups as long as you cooled them off some first too. I haven't tried that. You might get some funny looks sucking on a \"baby food\" pouch, but do you care? I don't. :)<br /><br />Bottom line: Convenient, fairly easy to fill (don't lose the funnel!), pretty easy to clean, and works well with items that have the proper consistency.

I have red, sensitive, dry skin that is currently being addressed to help add back hydration. I bought this to protect my facial skin moisture barrier. I didn't want a typical product that relies on petrolatum/mineral oil. I also didn't want to spend a lot as I would not need much of it nor would I need it every day. Many people recommend diaper rash cream for it's benefit from zinc, and ability to seal in moisture on damp face (or out, as would be needed for a diaper rash cream on a baby's butt)however the rest of the ingredients are not favorable to me, especially not my face. Yet I looked into more naturally based diaper rash creams to see what I could find. I went with the Honest company due to its nourishing ingredients as well as its availability in local stores (but I still ordered from Amazon). I think it was about the same price here.  Upon use, it is evident that it is moisturizing. It goes on smooth and spreads easily, not thick and not too thin; there is no drag against skin.  There is a scent, not sure what it stems from as I can't quite identify it. From what I can tell from the label, it isn't an artificial/synthetic fragrance, but it is a scent, so keep that in mind when making a selection if you or your baby are sensitive to that sort of thing. If you are using this on face, be sure to moisturize and/or apply on damp face as the intention is to keep moisture in. If you are using it on a baby's bottom, be sure the butt it totally dry before application  or you will only exacerbate the problem. Diaper rash creams act as a barrier, so while I want to keep the moisture in for my use, you will want to keep the moisture out with use.<br />Besides my face, I also use it on my hands.",

She has a desk attachment at school, but they are ridiculously expensive.  I'll be honest and say that I wasn't really expecting much.  I thought that for the price this would be fun to play with on occasion.  This turned out to be so much better than the regular wheelchair tray.  The adjustable sides kept her from dropping puzzle pieces or other little toys and the cup holder was very handy.  I was concerned that the strap would not reach around her big power wheelchair, but it can be adjusted to a very large size if needed.  The side pockets are great for storing toys or snacks.  Although it doesn't really effect how one uses it, she loved the pink color and the nice texture of the tray.  I think she is going to get a lot of use out of it and will be the most stylish wheelchair user around.",

It’s very handy that it can be used as a wash and shampoo. It smells wonderful too, a light honey scent. I was a little concerned because sometimes fragrance bothers his sensitive skin but this one was fine.",

She isn't walking yet, just sitting in it, so I'm not sure how easy it will be for her to manuever it. In order to let it down, you have to remove the pink sides and attach them at the bottom, basically a lot of work to do versus the other walkers with the cross bars where you press a button and it goes up and down. Although, this could prove much safer so it wont collapse on the child. I saw some people saying the kids got their fingers stuck, but I havent had that problem.

After 17 years of being out of the game, I found myself searching the options to create a perfect “infant-toddler utopia..” with travertine tile on most of my main floor sent me searching for a safe solution- this is the perfect mat to grow with our needs from infant to toddler, providing tummy time and all movements up too toy exploring- all while providing comfort and peace of mind to safety!<br />I chose the largest of the mats which is perfect for our front room TV area. Yes! Being larger also allows room for the adults to sit next to baby and as they play around on the mat. With larger mat I can accommodate plenty of toys making this an oversized play arena of sorts! The gray is a light solid cover without creases (which I love because, nothing can get into a crack to hide and be in harms way of baby putting item in its mouth! ) I’ve found with all the “scientific” influence of babies only seeing black/white or, overkill busy prints- This is not one of those! It will not cause the front room in your house to look like a play barn!!<br /><br />The comfort is amazing with this mat! The intelligence put into this design; to create the right layers of cushion all ergonomically mastered for safety, comfort and longevity.. A trifecta of goodness! Sold at a higher price point it should be top quality and it is! This has the ability to go the distance of child rearing , if cared for and stored appropriately. Truly, NO detail was left out of the quality/comfort department- this is best described as a thick padded gymnastics/tumbling mat. It performs more in line with a commercial/Olympic quality.. but, with the ease of using in your own home! Definitely an investment worth making!<br /><br />I hope this info helps… Feel free to let me know!",

It's a sweetener - that just makes no sense to me.<br /><br />These wipes do their job, but at a budget breaking cost. The Amazon Basics wipes cost less and you get  480 wipes total, but these are just 150 wipes total in the 6 pack. That's a pretty significant difference for no functional upgrade.",

This is battery operated but requires 3 AAA batteries (NOT included). It comes with the unit itself with an attached carry loop for hanging on a carriage and an instruction pamphlet.<br /><br />Operation is simple as per my video. All the controls are located in the front with an ON/OFF button, volume up and down, and track forward and back. There is no light or headset jack. The timer does not offer continuous play but can go for 15, 30, and 60 minutes. The notes are crisp and clear but the limited sounds are just okay and sound mostly the same.<br /><br />In summary, this is not worth the purchase due to the need for AAA batteries. Also, the current price of $18.74 ($24.99 minus 25%)  is expensive for this unit. If looking for a portable rechargeable unit, I recommend either [[ASIN:B0B259KS9B this]], [[ASIN:B0B5H4TXZM this]], or [[ASIN:B09WJ1HC3N this]]. One of my favorite non-portable plug-in models with 34 sounds is [[ASIN:B09YRZ53JS this]].",

I'm grateful that my boys haven't been too picky about what type of bottle we use with them.(now pacis are a completely different story). We just swap up whatever is clean. Since they don't have great issues, my favorite bottles are the ones with less pieces to keep clean. This one has 6 pieces, so honestly, it's a last resort!<br /><br />Overall, I have no reason to recommend these over any other brand.",

            "question": "title: not super ideal for play pen if your kid is smarter than you parents\ntext: I like this Super Wide Gate but can't give it a full 5 Star review since my  10.5 months old son is able to move it. I purchased it because I needed the play pen application while I do my chores so I can have piece of mind my son not being able to crawl unsupervised through the house since he seeks me out. Unfortunately it is not giving me piece of mind since he crawls right up to the gate and takes his little hands and figured out how to push up on against it or pull it towards him long enough to create an opening wide enough for him to get through. So as a play pen unless they interlock not giving me what I was looking for. Still better than its plastic counterparts though. It does mount to the wall so we will try that and create an area when he can't slip through. Hard with our current house layout....hence the play pen idea. It is still a great product. Heavier than its plastic competitors and sturdier. It's good quality.",

It is very well engineered. There is more than enough leverage to hop sidewalk curbs even when fully loaded. The wheels steer well and easily negotiate going up one inch height differences at driveways without having to raise the front wheels while pushing.<br />Due to the size, and because we have ample storage, we do not fold it up. We just cover it with a sheet and store until ready to stroll to the park at a moment's notice.<br />The wheel locks work easily for resting at inclines.<br />Plenty of room for adult accessories, including a drink cup holder.<br />We have not yet tried the child stand-up feature.<br />If there is a problem, (and no problems expected) additional comments will be provided.<br />This stroller is a pleasure to use.

These are perfect.<br /><br />The top is silicone, so it's soft - no scraped fingers. Yet, she can still reach in and get her snacks easily. When turned upside down, the snacks don't fall out. Now, eventually your little one will figure out how to hold one side of it open and shake all of the contents out. That is sort of inevitable and a downside of just about every snack cup a kid can use on their own.<br /><br />All in all, I think this was a great buy.

I'm a perfectly healthy person, it's just that I like to stay active by hiking and playing tennis.....A LOT.  I usually get some sort of friction rub especially when hiking, due to the length of the hikes, the heat, humidity and needing to relieve oneself along the way.  After a day or two it can get a bit tender.  I have used and continue to use several different brands of diaper rash creams and they all work quite well (except for Desitin - it stings, remember that if you use it on a sore baby's behind) but the DermaSav is especially good.  I went on a hike this weekend and used it BEFORE and after I got back and was quite happy that I was not sore at all!!  It does leave a barrier that seems to stay a bit longer than the other diaper rash creams, but I wouldn't say it was heads and tails above them.  Actually, it does about as well as the others but does seem to last a little bit longer.  I don't know if the tiny amount of Calamine lotion does anything but give the cream a pink tinge.  It's in such a small amount (1%) that I don't see it as contributing anything beneficial.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very good skin protectant cream,  though I cannot say how well it will soothe someone who wears incontinence underwear, or is bed-ridden.",

My niece loves, loves, loves the princesses when she visits & fit is comfortabl\ntext: I was having a conversation with my barely three year old niece about her upcoming visit to our house and she proudly informed me that she now wears &#34;big girl pretty panties&#34; instead of diapers. Her mother translated later for me that my niece is now in training pants full time, so I decided my guest suite supplies ought to include something suitable for my niece. These Cutie Princess Training Pants turned out to be the right choice.<br /><br />My niece is utterly delighted with the princess images and we had to give her a pair to carry around with her to show off to her Granny rather than showing the ones she was actually wearing. These fit her fine, her mother says there aren't any red marks from the elastic or leg areas. The Velcro type closures on both sides are working fine and reattaching with no loosening. My niece thinks my house is magic because we have princess panties here. :-)<br /><br /> I tested the leak factor by taking one pair and pouring measured water directly into the liner and then twisting until it leaked. It took two and a half cups of water with no dampness to the touch and no water wringing out. Two and three quarters cups resulted in a bit of water easing out of the sides. That's a lot of liquid and I am impressed with how much these hold. The image on the front of the pants does fade by the way, but you don't really feel any wetness.",

It is battery operated and is packaged with a USB cable, the unit itself, a circular clip, and an instruction pamphlet.<br /><br />I charged this for about one hour before use. Operation is simple as per my video. Press the ON/OFF switch on the side. There are seven operational buttons on the face of the unit. The white noise button is where the four white noise and four fan sounds are located. The lullaby button is where the eight nature sounds are such as chirping birds, a train going over the tracks, thunderstorm, etc. The timer feature goes from 30, 60, and 90 minutes or can be turned off to play continuously. There is a pause button and a light button with two brightness levels.<br /><br />The unit is really lightweight and highly portable. There is no headphone jack. The only major negative I see is that the ON/OFF button can be hit accidentally when the unit is being carried since there is no lock feature.<br /><br />The current price of $19.43 ($21.59 minus 10%) is on the high side of competitively priced for a portable unit with only 16 sounds and no lock button.",

            "question": "title: Beware, this product is composed largely of castor seed oil, the source of the notorious toxin called \"ricin\"\ntext: I have been avoiding any use of petroleum jelly (petrolatum), ever since I learned it can contain carcinogenic aromatic hydrocarbons, if they are not  distilled out. BabyGanics ointment is an &#34;all natural&#34; alternative to petroleum jelly, but without the petroleum toxins.  The first two ingredients listed in the ingredients of BabyGanics Protective Ointment are &#34;castor seed oil&#34; and &#34;hydrogenated castor oil&#34;.  Wikipedia states &#34;All parts of the [castor] plants are toxic, but most dangerous are the seeds...The principal toxin of castor bean is ricin, which...may comprise up to 3% of the seed weight...&#34;  and that ricin is a nerve toxin, which can be fatal in even small amounts.  Petrolatum and this &#34;all-natural&#34; alternative product both seem to me to be potentially too risky to use.<br /><br />Update:  Ricin is so toxic that production of castor oil for human use relies both on the water-solubility of ricin, and on the fact that ricin is denatured by heat. No substance is infinitely water-soluble and zero oil-soluble. Solubility is measured by the &#34;partition coefficient&#34;, the ratio by which the solute dissolves in water versus oil when the aqueous solution is shaken with the oil. Some trace of ricin will be found in oil which is cold-pressed from castor beans, especially if there is any alcohol present, since castor oil and water both mix with alcohol. Aqueous ricin solution must be boiled for 10 minutes before the ricin is denatured.<br /><br />Summary: If any alcohol contaminates the production process, and if the castor oil is not heated sufficiently, trace amounts of ricin could persist in the castor oil. How much ricin is needed to kill a person or cause nerve damage? Trace amounts. I am not willing to take that chance.<br /><br />Reference: Barnes DJ, Degradation of ricin in castor seed meal by temperature and chemical treatment, Industrial Crops and Products 3/2009; 29(2):509-515.",

It is surrounded by a nice cushion, which I really like and really helps add  to the safety factor for me.  It has a remote control, at first I thought why would you want a remote control, but it is amazing. You can turn it off or on if the baby is sleeping or gets fussy. It does not have to have lights and sound all the time, which is great if you need more quite in the car. The batteries in the remote last a good long time, which I appreciate as well. I took away one star because it does tend to move around a lot, like I said, my son likes to look at himself, and when it moves and he can't see himself he can get fussy. Also because the remote does not let you choose lights only or music only, it is all or nothing.

I was hoping to find a more comfortable way of sleeping on my side than surrounding myself with multiple pillows. The pillow does the job but it's not perfect. After only a few weeks of use the cover started pilling and is turned scratchy, which I find terribly annoying. It is also very thin. Note that the cover isn't 100% cotton but a polyester blend. I can understand why they can't produce a higher quality cover, this is so you buy another of their mediocre and expensive cases, which I refuse to do. So now I'm just using a regular pillowcase over it, so the part where I put my head is covered. Another issue is that it gives me a stiff neck.<br />On the plus side, I didn't find that it gets too hot (it's summer and 95+ degrees here), I was hotter when I had to sleep with four pillows around me. I also like that you can shape the pillow in different ways so I can also use it as back support when I'm sitting on the bed.<br />All in all, I see the Snoogle as a necessary evil in the third trimester, given that I have to sleep on my side. I do think it's overpriced.",

We are using this during the day when we're not around to keep him from falling. The opposite of the bed where the stairs usually has extra pillows surrounding the stairs just in case. This comes compressed but it expanded fully within a few hours. It's not a complete deterrent, but it does help. Our bed is a sleigh bed so we only have to worry about the sides. If he's walking around trying to find his way to the stairs, he will notice that there's something in his way and turn.

The photos are of this on a ShopRite cart. What is extremely refreshing is that instructions are provided.<br /><br />This cart cover is easy to install. I just put the patterned side up and flip over the material that goes around the handles and the back of the seat. There are two hook straps (one on each side) to secure the back in place to the thinner rungs of the cart (see photo).<br /><br />There are holes for the baby's legs and there is no strap to secure the crotch area in the center area as on another cover I tried. However there are straps to secure the baby in place, which are adjustable and secure.<br /><br />In the front, there is a window pocket to store incidentals such as ID, cash, or iPhone. There are also no extra straps. pockets, or loops for pacifiers or toys like some other cart covers have.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great, loose and large shopping cart carriage cover. I suspect it will fit a highchair but I really think it will be too loose for that. I love that this is simple and easy to set up. I also love that there are picture instructions. The current price of $29.99 is on the high side of competitively priced for this. I actually like this cover the best of all that I tried due to its simplicity.

I purchased this specific brand/type of gate because I really liked it when my son was a baby. It's cheap, effective and easy to use - no installation. I was really confused when it arrived and the little latching mechanism appeared to have changed. Now, all of the parts that were previously metal (other than the wires of the gate itself) are plastic including the latch. Previously it was metal and you could just push it down and you were done. Now it's a plastic thing you have to pinch down the tab and slide it. Not a big deal really but I am hoping it holds up as well as the metal. I can see how this helps make it more toddler proof because it's hard enough as an adult to unlatch it. One handed is not really an option anymore either.

As some other reviewers have mentioned, when he sleeps with his face down, he will wake up with the weave pattern slightly indented on his cheek.  Personally, this has not bothered me much--the inprint goes away quickly and is worth the peace of mind vis-a-vis airflow.  We also use very thin cotton sheets (the mattress topper is visible through the sheets) so I wonder whether thicker sheets would help with this problem.  The cushioning has been great--although I would have liked even a little more cushion, but I do understand that this is not the purpose of this item.",

This gate works very well for all of these purposes. We also had to buy the extension, and despite the fact that this is stretched to its very limit (53 inches in a 52.5-inch gap), it still works well and holds up. The metal is a bit soft, though, so when we let our dog out and he ran back into the room, he ended up bending the side of where the door is and it wouldn't close. But we bent it back into shape and it works again.

The instruction manual reflects this simplicity - there are almost no written instructions, just a few pictures to show you how to plug it and get it working.<br /><br />That said, the picture is fairly sharp and records the baby's movements well, though it's not as good as your standard video camera. But it's good enough for focusing a static image of the baby in the crib. I was a little disappointed to find that, while the monitor can be adjusted at an angle, it doesn't swivel around or have any pan or zoom features. It's designed to stay put in whatever position you leave it in. The night vision is fine, nothing extraordinary.<br /><br />Extras included the temperature feature, which is kind of neat, and a battery-saving &#34;peep&#34; mode.<br /><br />The only area that concerns me is the sound quality - you get an annoying &#34;echoing&#34; effect when you change the volume and a brief ringing that disturbs my eardrums. This also happens when you try to increase the volume on the microphone as well.  Once it settles into the new volume level, however, it's OK.<br /><br />Another area I'm concerned about is the casing. It's made of cheap plastic, which makes me wonder about how long this device will function smoothly.  However, if you're looking for a basic, relatively inexpensive video baby monitor that is very easy to set up, this one fits the bill well.",

I used the soap as both a shampoo and body wash and it did not sting my eyes. It also has a nice soft fragrance and lathers exceptionally well, which I love.

I had to be careful to press lightly on them because if I did not, a lot of soap or lotion would come out.<br /><br />Other than the quick way this dispenses, the soap and lotion are wonderful both for babies and adults.<br /><br />PS This company sells this same body wash and lotion but WITHOUT the boxed set for a higher price [[ASIN:B07MRSWN91 here]]; so I would buy this set over that since as of this writing that one is $21.98 and this set is $17.97.",

You can make several bottles at once or you could simply have it ready to go each time you need a new bottle.  It's very easy to use and it is easy to clean as well.  If you are using bottled water this isn't an issue,  but if you use tap water you may need to descale it every once in a while.

I use it to keep my dogs on the back patio  - they get the lower deck when company is over and this gate helps keep them - although I do have one small dog that she is a master at escaping and she's learned to \"Flat Stanley\" herself and go under the gate.  The reason she can and does do this is because it doesn't hurt her.  All in all, that's fine with us.  The gates work, they retract perfectly and if it kinda jams just stretch out and slowly allow it to retract.  I've had to do that maybe 5 times.  My only advice is do NOT just allow it to \"roll up\" on it's own, guide the gate - it doesn't take but a second.  My son just being the crazy kid he is just allowed it to snap back on it's own - ummmm....don't advise you do that.  It can be undone but someone could get hurt.",

It can be used in the kitchen and raises the baby to a height that is more comfortable, but I use it mostly in the bathtub and I use the bottom section to sit on and again keep my back from hurting. I just turn the baby tub upside down in the “big tub” when not in use and it is ready to go for next time. So you have an infant tub, a toddler tub, and a stand that fits under the bottom to raise it higher or can be used as a stool. As the baby grows older, the stool can also be used for the child to stand on to reach the bathroom sink for washing hands or brushing teeth.

The rubber seals really do hold in smells. So, unless the pail is open, I really don't smell anything. I have been using it with my planet wise pail liners but I imagine it would work well with most cloth pail liners. The one negative thing I can think of is that it is fairly small but I haven't found that to be a problem. I wash diapers every other day and haven't had a problem yet. I actually kind of like that it is small because it makes it easier to remember that the diapers need to be washed. If you wash diapers every 3 days you might find that it gets too full.",

It’s made with heavyweight nylon that will resist rips and tears and that can be wiped clean. As a diaper bag, it has everything you need with lots of useful pockets and compartments, as well as an included changing pad, yet it doesn’t look like a diaper bag. Perfect for men or women who prefer a diaper bag that’s a little classier and not obviously a diaper bag.<br />Take out the changing pad, and the bag is ideal for carrying back and forth to work or school with a compartment for a laptop. The interior pockets hold your phone, glasses, charging cords, pens and pencils, a water bottle…whatever you need. Also good for an airplane carry-on.<br />The bag comes with an optional shoulder strap.<br />The only thing I don’t love is that the top doesn’t zip closed. The flap folds over and is secured with a plastic clasp and mostly covers the  top, but the ends remain open meaning the potential is there for small items to slip out.

This formula is sweetened with fructooligosaccharide (FOS) which is much better than high fructose corn syrup and even sugar.  FOS are used primarily as a low-calorie, alternative sweetener. People can eat and drink products made with FOS instead of those containing sugar, which spike glucose levels in the blood, and cause weight gain. FOS may also be preferable to artificial sweeteners, some of which have been linked to everything from weight gain, to diabetes.  If your child has an intolerance to fructose then this would probably not be a good product for her/him to drink because it could cause gastric problems - bloating, diarrhea, etc...<br /><br />This product has vitamins and things necessary for healthy development.

I had mentioned this on a similar teether and was told food safe glue was used. Nevertheless, the baby is unlikely to get their mouth on this part. I have given several drop-resistant teethers to my neighbor's baby and also a couple of other babies and they are a hit.<br /><br />This is made in China.

I have a very bad neck and back and cannot push traditional shopping carts or even baby strollers. This cart is so easy to place in the car and easy to take out. The only negative, which is kind of a big negative for me, is that the handle to push the cart is too low. I am only 5’2” and it’s even too low for me. Someone who’s tall would struggle with it, so be warned. I use this cart for light shopping trips only. You don’t want to use it for heavy duty purchases like cases of canned sodas or 2 gallons of milk, etc. unless those of the only items you’re buying. It’s great for shopping the farmers market and for small- to medium-quantity trips to the grocery store. If you put items that are too heavy in it I don’t think it will last long. I believe it’s made out of light-weight aluminum, the same material the lightweight steppings stools are made of. I bought the canvas insert bag which attaches with Velcro. The bag is really nice, fits well, and even zippers shut. So if you buy the cart I highly recommend the bag too. I would give this cart a five star easily if the handle was adjustable or taller. Hopefully the makers of this product will see this review and heed this message because it really is a big flaw that i’m sure will prevent many taller buyers from purchasing and/or keeping this product.",

He far preferred it over his infant carrier, probably due to being at a slightly better angle to see out of the side window of the van (still rear facing, of course.) Then we were rear-ended without the kids in the car, and I had to replace the seat due to manufacturer's suggestions. TWICE. (Memphis drivers- grrr.) We are now on seat number three and I really like it. It is easy to install, when you have read the instructions. It is bulky, but moves easily from one car to another. It is super padded, seems sturdy and the cup holders are convenient for cups and pacifiers, small toys and lovies. We intend to keep him rear facing as long as the weight limit allows, and at the current rate of growth, he may ride that way until he's 18 lol.  It's super sturdy, durable and the cover feels like it will hold up to inevitable washings due to illness, spills, and general toddler junk smeared on it.<br /><br />I have not tried any of the other features other than a rear facing infant seat, which was the selling point for me. It is likely that I will replace it before we are ready for the booster option, but it is nice to know that the choice is there.",

The size 4 in Baby Dry seems like it's a size smaller than the size 4 in Cruisers or Swaddlers, and I think it's because the side tabs are made smaller. I bought these to see if maybe my son wouldn't leak in the middle of the night, but nope, he still leaks, and his wearing these during the day causes them to constantly break apart. Oddly enough, the crystals don't fall out as easily as they do with Cruisers, but the seams are still split open and threatening to leak the contents all over the floor. I often go to change my son and can feel the hard crystals in the seat of the diaper that are still there, so I don't think they absorb very well. Maybe I got a bad batch, but I'm never buying Baby Dry again and am going back to Cruisers after this. My son will still leak in the middle of the night, but at least the diapers are somewhat more durable. I've never wanted to finish a box of diapers so quickly than I have with this box of Baby Dry - and I even had to pay nearly $10 more for a box of lower quality diapers. Very disappointed. I just wish I could find something that he wouldn't leak through.<br /><br />EDIT: So upon using these for a bit longer, I've realized what the problem is: I keep looking for an all-purpose diaper from Pampers, and there just isn't one in existence. The Baby Drys do keep my son drier during the night, but if he wears them during the day, they break at about two hours in (sometimes less), and he gets very upset, saying &#34;Diaper leak! Diaper leak!&#34; The best I can see is that these need to be paired with Cruisers, but even those break, too - just not nearly as often as the Baby Drys do.",

These are shorter, but just as wide as other brands, which I think attributes to the ruffling. Third, why is the branding different? The box branding and the branding on the individual pads is different. Same brand name. Different fonts. Different colors. Different look. Why would a brand do that?

The brake operates both back wheels. When you are through walking your baby, you can then easily break the stroller down with one hand. The stroller is also lightweight. When using the car seat, it can accommodate a baby from 4 pounds to 35 pounds when in the rear facing position. When using the stroller only, it will accommodate a child from birth to 55 pounds.

My biggest complaint with the ktan was bunching and twisting. I am free from that here. I also love the back support. The ktan was supportive but this is WAY more efficient and effective at distributing the weight because the straps don’t bunch and twist and they lay as designed.

The toy is somewhat heavy (especially for a young baby to lift). It measures about 6\" wide, 6\" tall, and 1.5\" deep. When you turn on the power, the heart button lights up. It makes noises and songs when you twist the head from side to side, rotate the tail, shake the lion, and press the heart. Both the tail and the arch between the feet can act as a handle. The green leaf on the handle between the feet has different textures and is apparently soft enough for teething. The songs are simple and catchy. The toy will automatically shut off if not touched for approximately 35 seconds. It will turn on again when you press the heart button or turn the lion's mane. Twisting the lion's mane will trigger sounds and the light will flash. Pushing the heart button will play songs, melodies, and phrases. Twisting the tail produces a clicking sound. Shaking the lion causes it to play sounds and the light to flash. There are 3 short songs, 15 melodies, and several phrases.",

Daughter is 18 months old, and it's big enough that it should work for quite a while... I'd guess probably at least another year (if she still needs it by then).",

The sheet is 39x27 - so it SHOULD fit.I washed the sheet and dried it (according to the label you should be able to do this - and it's a play yard sheet so it's useless if you cannot) then tried to fit it on the mattress just to double check. I am glad I did. There was absolutely no way this was going to fit on the mattress. It was about 2/3 the size of the mattress. It was nowhere near fitting - not even close. Now since I didn't try to fit it before I washed I have no idea if this was due to shrinking in the wash or if I got one that was defective and the wrong size. Amazon was very helpful and had no complaints about taking it back. It's too bad, I expected better from Carters.<br /><br />I ended up ordering the [[ASIN:B001KZH692 American Baby Company Organic Interlock Pack N Play Sheet]] to try instead of this one.

It will fit mini-crib mattresses up to 3&#34; thick. So check-out the size prior to purchase. Since it's cotton, you can machine wash and tumble dry on low for easy maintenance. However, I always wash all new bedding prior to using as the manufacturer's put a coat of &#34;sizing&#34; on the fabric that babies and some adults are allergic to. This particular percale sheet is crisp and is more durable. It actually softens after each washing and is great for the hot summer months as cotton will wick away moisture from babies skin. We only purchase bed sheets for ourselves that are 300 count or higher. So we wanted our grandson to have the softness we enjoy too. The higher the thread count, the softer the fabric is.

            "question": "title: Not for the Weak\ntext: A few things to consider when buying this jogging stroller.  First, while it is definitely built to last, the stroller is HEAVY.  After my \"last child\" turned 5 and entered school full time, I gave away my 7 year old Baby Jogger.<br /><br />Well.  Fast forward a few years and along came one \"last\" child.  I thoroughly researched the new generation jogging strollers and settled on the Mountain Buggy Terrain for two reasons.  One--it accommodates newborns.  Two--it's ergonomic design and adjustable handle (I am 5 ft tall) were important.<br /><br />When it arrived, it was clear that this was a heavy duty stroller.  After some assembly (the manual needs to be improved) I put my then 3 1/2 month old in and went for a test run.<br /><br />While it had been a long time since I had run with a jogging stroller, I was in great cardiac shape from maintaining a healthy exercise regime during pregnancy and post partum.  It was much harder to push than my Baby Jogger.<br /><br />The Second thing you should know before buying is that there is a strong \"TRACKING\"  issue that is extremely irritating and may lead you to return the stroller.  On my first test run and every other run since, I have had to adjust the front wheel since it constantly pulls to the left.  I occasionally had to do this with my Baby Jogger.  Occasionally, not frequently!<br /><br />The heaviness of the stroller combined with the tracking issue has left me with a sore wrist.  This is not the stroller for jogging and pushing it one handed for most of your run.<br /><br />That being said,  I can compensate for the weight of the stroller.  The tracking issue is not easily remedied though.  I tried using the wheel in the swivel position to evaluate the tracking issue.  It pulled so badly to the left that  now I only use it in the locked position.<br /><br />I would have given this stroller five stars if the tracking issue was easily adjusted.  It isn't.  As for the weight of the stroller, it is built like a tank and thus it is  meant for rough roads and trails (where it performs beautifully).  That is the trade off that is made compared to my Baby Jogger ---that I loved using on well maintained and paved paths.<br /><br />Despite the weight and tracking issues,  this jogger is designed with safety and comfort in mind.  The buckle requires 2 hands to unlock.  Perfect.  The sun hood is awesome.  Regardless of the time of day, I can adjust the hood to protect my baby from the sun and wind.  The adjustable handle is a must.  Many of the joggers on the market have a fixed handle and are just too high for shorter people.  The water bottle holders are a great addition; the basket and zipper pouch are as well.<br /><br />As for performance, the ride is extremely smooth.  My Baby Jogger was definitely made for speed and smooth paths;  however that meant a lot of bounce on more bumpy rides!  The Mountain Buggy has very little extra bounce on he bumpy-dirt trails.  One more thing, this jogging stroller is not easy to tip over.  While it is less nimble than my Baby Jogger, the MB Terrain is not likely to tip when making a sharp turn (a turn requiring a lift of  the front wheel).<br /><br />I have not taken the Terrain on a run longer than 6 miles yet and cannot comment on long distance performance.<br /><br />My baby typically sleeps well during our runs and seems quite comfortable and content in this stroller.<br /><br />Overall.  Great design.  Needs a permanent fix for the tracking issue.",

            "question": "title: Initially Frustrating to Adjust, but Very Workable\ntext: We take long car trips on occasion and I selected this with the idea of being more comfortable in my vehicle. I made a mistake in my understanding of what this product is and how it’s shaped so it doesn’t meet the need I had in mind (which is on me, not the product or the manufacturer – I though it was an adjustable cushion), though it is still useful and it is a good product. Now that I understand it better, I see the real value in it. My main complaint is in the adjustments, which were not clear at first and led to some frustrations until I figured them out.<br /><br />This is a harness of sorts, which is suitable for preventing head side-tilt when resting. This idea here is to help one from developing neck pain from head tilt. It is more comfortable than it looks, and it is adjustable to handle different heights. It is sturdy enough to accommodate larger individuals without straining. It does a good job of keeping one’s head/neck straight while in use.<br /><br />It works by attaching around the headrest of a car, so that it is fastened securely to the seat. My issue with this unit is that it was initially very difficult to figure out how to make the adjustments so that it could be attached properly. Specifically, it was unclear how to make the arms wider to fit; I discovered the latches eventually, but even with the markings on the frame of the unit I needed some trial and error before I managed to get the thing adjusted. It’s easy now that I know how to do it, but it was very frustrating up to that point.<br /><br />While I did not get this harness with proper understanding of how it is designed, I have come to appreciate it for what it is. It does a good job of preventing neck pain in the car that results from slumping over when sleeping on a trip. My only real complaint is that it is initially frustrating to adjust; once past that hurdle, it is a very usable and helpful harness.",

BUT, didn't need to. It worked just fine. i also LOVE how it has TWO straps for attaching it to the chair! One to go around the back and one to go around the seat. It doesnt budge an inch!

But I will say upfront, in case this is something  you avoid- these are a \"product of China\". If you avoid that, then these won't cut it.. If it isn't a concern, then know that these are labeled as \"free from Gluten and GMO\". Also, no milk, nuts, eggs, no artificial ingredients or preservatives. Made with premium \"Japonic rice flour\". Also,<br /><br />100% BPA-free packaging, produced in a peanut free facility, and carries the trademark of the national foundation for celiac awareness.<br /><br />There are 4 boxes of 12 wrapped Rice teethers contained in a sealed bag. This is nice, as it makes it easier to take it on the go and to keep it fresh. Each packet contains 2 elongated rice snacks. A serving is 4 rusks (or biscuits), which is actually 2 full packages, making it 6 servings per box. The shape reminds me of a surf board. They are a light, flat yet puffed mild tasting rice biscuit with a hint of banana flavor. If you ate the whole serving (2 packages of 2), it is just 30 calories with 20 mg of sodium and not much of anything else.<br /><br />The ingredients are: rice flour, potato starch, sugar (&lt;1g per serving), banana powder, sea salt, natural banana flavor.<br /><br />Sometimes I have grabbed a similar product off the store shelves for my consumption, especially when I have been dieting and just want something to nosh on. I elected to try these for the same purpose. I thought maybe I would share with my two labs, but I aim to avoid any products made in China with them. Me, that is a different story.<br /><br />So while they won't last me long once I start eating one, I imagine it would take a while for a teething kiddo to work through the rice snack. They have some give, while also maintaining firmness.<br /><br />I included pics- I had already started eating one when I thought to take pictures.",

            "question": "title: Infants or pets can be safely contained provided they are not very active or destructive\ntext: The Summer Infant Pop 'n Play Portable Playard is not only for infants, but small pets can also be contained comfortably and safely if the child or animal is not overly active.  Designed for children from 6 to 24 months or a maximum of 35 inches tall, the 14 square foot area is much greater than the playpen I used for my daughter years ago.  This playard is incredibly lightweight and as simple to assemble as can be.  The one I received has the neon green base and all black parts with the exception of the top protective dark gray pads.  You just open the metal parts and the playard snaps right into place.  Be sure to secure the netting by drawing the straps underneath each of the six legs and securely snap shut.  When strapped, the netting remains in a taught state, adding containment and security while allowing your child/ren or animal/s a 360 degree visibility of the outside world.  Nuts and bolts on this are a shiny chrome and I have felt no rough or dangerous surfaces.  Sewn into the netting is a pocket for keeping the enclosed written materials, but this is really very simple and needs no detailed instructions.  I keep it in the pocket in the event that I need to contact the company or want to share the information with passersby who are interested in obtaining a playard themselves (already has happened)!  I do feel strongly that this needs to be supervised with older toddlers who are more ambulatory because it is very lightweight.  Its design is for transport and occasional use either inside or out, having a single sheet of water resistant fabric as a base.  Warnings are included on the product to not put pillows, pads, mattresses or other such items inside the playard.  I also would not use this if any of the items break or the net rips because it could viably cause harm.<br /><br />We've enjoyed this on the hardwood floor, on a carpet and on the lawn, but haven't taken it to the beach, so I can't yet describe how it functions when in sand.  My impression is that it would be great, but I'd obsess about cleaning it afterward to remove sand and salt.  It can be wiped down with mild detergent and warm water, then towel or air dried, so if baby messes up, it usually will not be permanent.  I personally assure it is dry before placing it inside the carrying case to keep it fresh and not create a medium for mold.<br /><br />I was unfamiliar with Summer Infant products when first offered this product, but have since then done a little research on the company.  Located in Rhode Island, they support local nonprofits as well as national groups.  They also sell a canopy which can be placed on top of one section of the playard and it seems like that is a desirable accessory, especially for younger infants who would not be moving away from the shaded area.  The price of this product is less than many other pack and play items I've seen, but the quality of its construction is top notch.  It is well worth the price and I can recommend this to those who need an easy to move and carry containment product for infants or small pets.  When used properly and abiding by the age and height restrictions, I think it would last for more than one child.  If used for pets, I would also pay attention to the personality of the animal -- if it's very active or destructive, the netting will not last, despite the secure metal sides/legs.  For newborn and young puppies or kittens, I think it would be outstanding.",

It looks like you might be able to wear it on your back or front while carrying your baby in the fold out seat  (though I'm not sure it was made to do that so I wouldn't carry my baby like that in it) that doubles as a pouch to hold stuff.  My only concern and the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that I think that after enough uses, the plastic lining the inside will crack and split like it does in diaper bags with the same kind of plastic.

So, it went to my grand boys' room to store their toys away nicely, instead. It's very thick and sturdy and the handles make it easy for me to hold while they are running around doing their \"clean up\" song. I love it!",

The glass is something to sit on the table and protect it from my 9 year old and daily wear and tear.  Removed sometimes when we have dinner parties.  The corners of the glass were not rounded as I expected (fabglassandmirror) and were quite sharp.  I was not prepared to attempt filing or using sanding emulsion on the corners of tempered glass - so this was the solution.  As you can see from the pics, these are quite well suited to the task.  They don't extend too far and have good thickness.  Product consists of a large number of corners and separate pieces of 3M clear double-sided tape.  Place tape on protective corner and place both on table.  If you get air bubbles you can try again (you can see a few air bubbles in one of the pics).  Highly recommended!",

Just moisturizing enough and not sticky.  The scent is very, very light and the texture isn't too runny or too thick.  It absorbs into the skin rather quickly so there's no worry about it feeling greasy and slick.  The color is well, oatmeal colored (a light tan shade).  The price for a three pack is great, especially given the size of the bottles and the fact that, as an adult female, one pump does my entire leg.  The bottles will last even longer on a baby.  I tested this on my skin and had no negative reactions whatsoever.  The only concern is the fact that this contains alcohol, which some sources say shouldn't be used in products applied to a baby/toddler's skin, especially those who are prone to rashes or deal with eczema.",

I live in Alaska and needed an all terrain stroller that could handle the roads here but that would work for running as well. I`m a runner, but usually run my long runs alone while the hubby watches the littles. So I figured this one would do the job and the price was right. I am VERY pleased with it!  The color is beautiful, the stroller is very sturdy and I love that it already comes with all the accessories (cup holder etc...). It really does have a great sun shade and I love how when you fold it to put it in the trunk, you can easily pop the two back wheels off to make it more compact. It is bulky, but that`s to be expected with a jogging stroller. It`s very roomy, my 6 year old loves it and the baby carrier snaps very easily in it. I really don`t have any complaints about it at all! Now, if I knew I was going to run a lot more long distances with it, I think I might have gone with the BOB. But this one was awesome enough that there was no justifying the price difference. I highly recommend this stroller for anyone looking for an all terrain jogging stroller.",

            "question": "title: Nice Gate\ntext: We're fostering a dog right now and we set up a few gates in the house to restrict him from parts of the house. We have this gate at the top of the stairs. We like that it has an option for no-screw attachment since the dog situation is just temporary. Installation was fairly straight forward. My husband did not run into any obstacles putting it up. There are straps/buckles to keep the gate in place rather than screws. It doesn't look as nice as a permanent attachment would be, but for our purposes, we're pleased. One of the first times my daughter opened it, she pulled the whole gate out of hinges by lifting it too high. We have other gates by the same brand and for those we have to pull up slightly to open them, so that's what she was doing with this one. This one does not require that at all and she hasn't had any problems since that one time now that she knows it's not necessary. The gate is pretty sturdy. Our staircase goes up straight and then it turns for four more steps. So even if the gate fell and someone fell down the stairs, it's only a short drop. I would be more wary of it if we had a straight staircase AND a little child. Since we have neither, it doesn't worry me. Overall, it's a nice gate and is allowing doggo a little more freedom in the house.",

However, this bag is versatile because it can be used as a regular backpack or as a diaper bag with a small waterproof changing pad enclosed.<br /><br />FEATURES<br />- The front of the bag has one small zippered compartment below the handles on top. I find it difficult to get my hands in that compartment but it is large enough to hold keys or a small phone.<br /><br />- The front bottle compartment is \"cooler style\" and can hold two bottles. There is also a mesh folder pocket inside that compartment and a central area for some small storage. The envelope closure is via one Velcro strip.<br /><br />- The central compartment has four more bottle pockets. There is one on each side and two in front and one of them is \"cooler style.\" a folder pocket in back, two shorter bottle-sized folder pockets on the other side, along with a zippered pocket behind that. Also, inside are another two small zippered pockets large enough for some cash or a small phone. One pocket is located on the top and the other is located on the bottom of the back \"door.\" There is also a strap with clip that can hold keys or a pacifier and it has a clip that can be detached for removal without having to unclip the keys or pacifier.<br /><br />- Inside the central compartment is the thin waterproof diaper changing pad and another separate bottle bag that can be carried by itself or hung on a stroller.<br /><br />- There is an exterior access door in the backpack shoulder strap area of the bag with access to the central compartment.<br /><br />- The shoulder straps are well-padded and are very comfortable to use.<br /><br />-There are two stroller straps on the top of the shoulder straps. They can be unclipped and hooked onto the stroller handle. I really love that they are attached and cannot be lost.<br /><br />- On the outside sides of the bag are bottle pockets, one of which can substitute for a wipes pocket with a flap through which to withdraw the wipes.<br /><br />- There is also a carry handle on the top of the bag if one does not want to use a shoulder strap and that has a pink fake leather closure to secure the handles together.<br /><br />In summary, this bag is durable as the material feels like a strong waterproof fabric but that makes it feel cheap. I love the beautiful floral design. It looks like a regular backpack and works like one too but doubles as a diaper changing backpack.  For the current price of $49.99 I would have expected a USB cable port to be included for use with a battery pack and one is not.",

When the tubing is not connected, the S1 (but not S2) is quite loud, so I thought the first one I got was defective. Once you put the tubing on, it is fine.<br /><br />The only downside for me has been that when I have needed to order additional pump parts, I could not just buy them in a store (or even the city breastfeeding center).

That being said, I like these honest diapers. A few areas where they don't quite add up to Pampers are<br />- there is no wetness indicator<br />- there is no way to easily distinguish the front from the back since it is the same pattern throughout<br />- the side tabs are less stretchy than Pampers<br /><br />Granted these areas are not that big of a deal for a night time diaper that you only have to put on and take off once a day, but still I find them not as ideal as a Swaddler.<br /><br />The sheep pattern is oh so adorable. The softness feels almost identical to Swaddlers, almost, but there is still nothing exactly like the blankie soft Swaddlers. I won't comment on price since that fluctuates all of the time on here.

I also like that it includes probiotics, although the potency level (200 million CFUs) is rather low even for a toddler-targeted snack. Still, the fact that it has any probiotics is a plus.<br /><br />Each pouch is a single portion, with a low (45) calorie count (which was more appealing to the adults than the kids).

            "question": "title: Excellent Configurability!\ntext: I am thrilled with how these remotes can be configured to work. I got the set with 3 outlet controllers and a remote that has 5 sets of on/off buttons. I later added a fourth outlet controller to the set. I originally bought it to control a lamp across the room at night. However, after getting it, I decided to use it for three other lamps I have as well. Now I have everything set up to any combination I could ever want!<br /><br />On/Off Buttons 1 - lamp 1<br />On/Off Buttons 2 - lamp 2<br />On/Off Buttons 3 - lamp 3<br />On/Off Buttons 4 - lamp 4<br />On/Off Buttons 5 - lamp 1, 2, 3, and 4 simultaneously<br /><br />So not only can I turn each lamp on and off individually, but I can turn all the lamps on and off as a set! It doesn't matter what button I used to turn them on. Even if I turn on the lamps individually, I can easily press the Off Button 5 to turn off all the lamps at once! I love this!<br /><br />The instructions were not very detailed as to how to configure the remote control. It's actually very easy. So let me include some basic instructions on how to program the outlet controllers with the remote control.<br /><br />To pair an outlet controller with a remote:<br />'(1) Plug the outlet controller into the wall socket.<br />'(2) Press and hold the learning button until a light begins to flash, then let go.<br />'(3) Press the button on the remote that you want to control the outlet controller.<br /><br />That's it! So simple! Repeat the steps above for any remote button you want. Each on and off button works independently so you can configure it any way you want.<br /><br />You can pair any button on the remote to any outlet controller, even if the button has already been paired with another outlet controller. For example, if you want the On Button 5 to control two outlets, simply repeat the steps above for each one. You don't have to do them together. Just do them like normal. Then when you press the On Button 5, both outlets will come on!<br /><br />Canceling a pairing requires that you reset the outlet controller. It's also very easy to do.<br /><br />To reset an outlet controller (cancel all pairings) so that no remote button will control it:<br />'(1) Remove the outlet controller from the wall socket.<br />'(2) Press and hold the learning button.<br />'(3) While still holding the learning button, plug the outlet controller back into the wall socket.<br />'(4) Continue to hold the button for 5 seconds or until the light begins to flash, then let go.<br />'(5) Once the light stops flashing, the outlet controller has been reset.<br /><br />The only drawback I can find is that you cannot plug two outlet controllers into a wall outlet due to their size. You can, however, plug the outlet controller into the top wall outlet and still use the bottom outlet as normal. I don't find this to be a big problem.<br /><br />I wish I had found these long ago. I am certain I will be buying more!<br /><br />UPDATE: I did buy more! I added another lamp to the room so I bought another outlet controller. I now have the remote control managing all four lamps. I could not be happier with this product!",

These pull-ups have a wide stretch waist for easy pull up and down. The sides do tear if there is an accident, making clean up a little easier.

Once three AA batteries are installed, the keys turn into a piano, producing different tones and lighting up. Two smaller buttons near the top, when pressed, cycle through melodies and tunes.<br />As far as a walker, I found it to be good, not great. The design means the handle is long without any support. If pressed on hard, it bends and gives a little. It doesn’t tip easily, but with a bigger, stronger child, it’s possible the handle could be pressed too far and either damage the toy or possibly cause it to tip. The wheels function well, though, and the design offers plenty of open space for baby to walk without having to straddle any parts of the toy.<br />As far as using as a play mat…also good. The pad is thin and the wording, “Happy Childhood” is a little odd, in my opinion. That said, there are lots of things for baby to grab and pull and rattle.<br />Overall, this is a good walker/toy, just maybe not the sturdiest you’ll find.",

            "question": "title: The 3rd BOB I’ve loved\ntext: I am a stroller fanatic and I love having the right stroller for the right occasion. A few years ago I bought a Single BOB Revolution for my first child, then bought the Duallie Pro when I had my second child, and now I received this Single Flex 3.0 for my third child. We have also owned a Baby Jogger, UppaBaby and Maclaren stroller, and BOB is my favorite to use and my preference for anything outdoors.<br /><br />Starting with unboxing and set up. This is very simple to assemble. I had it unboxed and together in about 10 min. Simply open it up, remove plastic, unfold stroller, pop back wheels on, slide axle through front wheel and fasten the nut to secure it in place.<br /><br />To fold: Squeeze the two levers on the underside of the handle to fold the top half down. Then pull up on the red semicircle to fully collapse the stroller. There is a red buckle to secure it in place if you want. To unfold, pull up in the handle bar until it clicks into position.<br /><br />The weight capacity on this is 75 pounds!! In most cases, it seems you will top out on height far before that though. I put my 40” tall 4 year old in there, and her head was up against the top of the stroller. Leaning the seat back slightly was better than when she was fully upright and looked more comfortable for her head. I think she would be ok using this stroller for a little longer, but I think the 44” height max listed on BOBs website is an exaggeration. (The duallie must sit lower on the frame because her head is not skimming the top of that stroller yet.) My 2.5 year old fit just fine in this.<br /><br />The quality is great. The material wipes down easily. I’ve never had any issues with the tires. They are my stroller of choice when traveling because they are so sturdy, and they’ve withstood being gate checked just fine. The underneath storage basket is not the largest or most accessible of the strollers I’ve used, but it is ok.<br /><br />This 3.0 Flex does not have a hand brake. (The Revolution Pro is the same stroller but does have a handbrake) —— I do run with my BOBs. I take my duallie out for 4-7 mile runs, and my kids are comfortable and content. I live in a moderately hilly location, and with a 2 and 4 year old in the duallie (which is about 100 pounds) I find the hand brake a must and is why I opted for the Pro Duallie. Even for walks around the neighborhood I find myself using the hand brake on the duallie. However, I never wished I had a hand brake when I was walking or running with my single BOB, even with the hills. I would consider how hilly your area is and the total weight you expect your stroller to get to when you decide between models.<br /><br />Differences between the 3.0 Flex and Flex - At first they seemed minute, and I wasn’t sure if they justified much of a price difference. After playing with the stroller more, I can appreciate the improvements made. First, the canopy now has a magnetic closure, which I have on a different stroller and it’s awesome and easy to use. It also has ventilation in the canopy now!! The ventilation also seems improved in the top portion of the seat back, and air will be flowing in even if the seat is in the fully upright position. On our older single BOB, the ventilation was in such a way that baby would only be getting some air flow if the seat was pretty far reclined. Now thanks to better back ventilation and added canopy ventilation, it is bound to be much cooler in there, regardless of seat incline. Second, there are 3 more pockets, 2 of which have zippers. There is a zippered pocket on the seat back and a zippered pocket on the flap hanging down where the canopy and handle bar meet. If you don’t have the console, this would be a great place to store a phone and keys. Also if you plan on folding the stroller a lot, these would be convenient from keeping things from falling out. For example, I now store dog clean up bags in the mesh pocket of my duallie, and a key in the hook and loop part of the console, but often when I fold the stroller these items have fallen out. The material is more reflective and more water resistant on this 3.0. The seat padding is supposedly improved too, but it’s not noticeable to me having not sat in either. Lastly the 3.0 has a bolted front wheel vs a quick release on the older model.<br /><br />As far as accessories go... the BOB Handlebar Console with Tire Pump is awesome. (Currently the bundle option comes with this for $20 more than the stroller alone, making it a good option) I pump my tires up every other month or so, and the roominess and quality of the rest of the console is great. The large cup holders can fit my liter sized Camelbak bottle, and the middle section is secure enough to hold my phone or keys while running. I also purchased the infant car seat adapter for my Chicco Keyfit and used it all of the time with my first child. It also made outings easier to click the car seat in to the stroller and not have to worry about moving a sleeping baby in or out of the main stroller. I also have the snack tray for my single BOB, but did not purchase it again for the duallie. It was a nice addition, but there is just so much room in the seat that I found it just as convenient to tuck a water bottle in one of the side pockets of the seat and a snack cup in the other. So simply because of the price of the tray, I probably wouldn’t recommend it. Lastly I’ve tried the weather shield for my duallie. I wanted to run at cooler temps, but was hesitant to run under 55 degrees or so. The weather shield kept my kids toasty for runs between 40 and 55 degrees. All of the BOB accessories I’ve used have been well made and very simple to use.<br /><br />Overall, I LOVE these strollers. They are so smooth, and it is effortless to push and maneuver. They handle uneven terrain well, gliding over sidewalk cracks, curbs, grass and dirt. For anything outside - walks, runs, trips to the zoo or park - they are my stroller of choice and fun to use. They have also held up very well despite travel and frequent use. I can’t recommend them enough!",

Hanging from the sloth are a leaf that makes a crinkle sound when touched, a sun with a mirror in the center, and one of the sloths' arms with a handle for the baby to grip and pull. As the arm is pulled down, the other arm extends...which, when the handle is released, vibrates the sloth as the top arm pulls him back close to the plastic branch that he's hanging from. There is a ring that attaches to this hard plastic branch so you can hang the sloth off a stroller, etc. We were somewhat concerned that the hard plastic might hit my baby niece in the head, but it hasn't happened so far. My 4-month-old niece loves exploring the different parts of this toy, but the leaf is her favorite. My 3-year-old niece also loves this toy, and we had to make it clear that it ultimately belonged to the baby.<br /><br />Care instructions: Surface washable.<br />Material content: 92% Polyester fibers, 6% polyester fiber batting, 2% plastic film.

It has two straps on the top that you an pick it up at but also two straps in the back that allow you to carry it like a backpack. Also on the back is a strap that allows you to attach it to your luggage when you are traveling. It also has a strap that lets you secure it across your chest to take some weight of your shoulders and evenly distribute it and make the weight less impactful. Last but not least there is also a hidden zippered pocket that you can keep some things in like travel documents or your cell phone or something.<br /><br />You also get additional straps that you can hang it onto your stroller something else if you choose to. On each side on the outside you have pockets for your beverage or your umbrella or whatever else you want to fit in there.<br /><br />In the front is a larger pocket. In that one are two insulate pockets for your baby bottles but obviously once your baby is larger you can fit other things in there as well. You also have another zipper pocket in there in which you can actually keep wet items if need be since it seems pretty water proof.<br /><br />The main compartment gets opened on the top and is fairly large. It has some inside pockets that help you keep it organized. The bag also came with another tiny bag sleeve in which you can roll up the entire bag if you want to.

This came in the box with everything included- parts, instructions, hardware.  It was very easy to put together by myself, it took me about 15 min if so.  Once put together I liked that it was not heavy, yet feels very sturdy.  My 18 month old climbed right in it without needing any help and absolutely loves it.  It is very stable, good quality materials, it looks great! My wife loves it too, and she is a hard one to satisfy when it comes to baby products.

This makes it easy to carry your child in his own seat, without lugging the base around.  I used this for my grandchild and we went into the doctor's office,  easily without disrupting his sleep.  Plus,  we can take this into any other car.....without lugging around the base.<br /><br />Another aspect of this Car Seat is that it has been tested......  if a company TALKS about the test,  then I believe they worked on it.<br /><br />The car seat is sturdy, not heavy, and the only downside is infants grow up too quick.

I personally always think that it is nice to give a new or expectant mother a token gift or something just for her. I sometimes make a “Mother Survival Kit” that includes a novel, wine, and other things to celebrate being a mother. But when I saw this bracelet, I thought it would be perfect for a friend of mine who just learned she is pregnant. Giving something like this would give a new mother confidence, especially considering this is a new experience, couple that with the stress of the unknown and body changes. This bracelet (by Diosky)  will send just the right sentiment of what a great Mom she is going to be!<br /><br />The bracelet itself is feminine, made of soft white/black marble, blue and pink beads (so it works for anyone who doesn’t or does know the sex of the baby) with silver accents and a silver (tiny baby feet) charm.  There is a sweet, encouraging note to the mom on the inside of the box. The packaging is great for gift-giving and there is even a card that you can address to the recipient.  In conclusion, this is a wonderful gift for yourself or someone else. Which makes it a bonus is that it is affordable.",

Probably because it doesnt contain \"masking\" ingredients. This has a fresh, clean, pleasant scent. I find that the wipes are plenty damp. More wet than a lot of body wipes, or wet wipes for toilet use. I think they are a good size and strength for doing a quick wipe down of the body as a means to freshen up anytime (especially post workout). I like using them as a \"bird bath\". I just take 1-2 and do a quick wipe down all over. The wipes hold up very well. No irritation.<br /><br />I had no trouble peeling off the protective seal. The lid is secure and snaps tight. The internal clip holds a wipe securely, and I find that it helps the wipe to break away from the next one with ease. I seriously just havent had any issues with this at all in any way. I imagine I will use these up way before there is any concern of them drying out.<br /><br />I dont rate on price (we all have different budgets, needs, values, we can see the price before purchase, prices fluctuate, and more recently prices of things across the board have gone up so I am not going to say what it worth it and what isnt...you decide that.). That being said.. 30 wipes for $10? A little much for me. Thankfully they are plenty wet, and I could get a good wipe down with these. Also, appears to be a healthy products, so if you use stuff like this a lot, it can be good to avoid or reduce some ingredients.",

It addresses almost every concern a parent might have regarding a food product meant for a child: it claims to use nothing but organic rice flour, organic sugar, organic blueberry abstract, purple carrot juice, sea salt, and organic carrot powder. It's gluten free, USDA Organic, produced in a peanut-free facility, packaged in BPA-free packaging and the packets are shipped in recycled cardboard boxes. In other words, it hits almost every keyword associated with high quality, good for the baby and the environment. The box design screams high quality and I can see this selling at Whole Foods. In addition, it tastes good (I sampled one): it is firm but also spongy, kind of like a wafer, shrimp chimp or puffed rice treat.<br /><br />The catch is that it's made in China. It is certified as organic, however, by a French organic agency, Ecocert SA, which apparently regulates organic facilities around the world. Ecocert SA seems reputable but I still question how a notoriously polluted country like China can manage to churn out any organic baby food when the soil, air and water is so very contaminated.  Do they import the organic ingredients from elsewhere and merely use a Chinese factory as the place to put all the parts together?  I would be more willing to trust a product like this if the company had taken the time to include a booklet or some sort of information card that would allay my fears.<br /><br />Until that time comes, however, I will be very cautious with offering this to a child. I tried one and immediately got a slight stomach upset. It's such a shame that so much effort clearly went into this product, but many will shun it because it doesn't clarify how a supposedly \"clean\" food comes from one of the most polluted countries on earth.",

The good news is, he likes it during the day(though still not his favorite), but the bad news(for us) is that it still doesn't compare to his bottle to get to sleep at night.<br /><br />The shape of this sippy cup is easy to grasp for my little one, so that's a plus.<br /><br />The only negative issue I've had is in connection with the valve. I put milk in this sippy cup(for a short trip to town), and the valve came loose. The WHOLE sippy cup poured out in the seat of our vehicle. Of course, the bag was soaked, too. Since then, I've really pushed the valve into the top to make sure it's good and tight. So far, I haven't had any more leaks. Lesson learned the hard way, though, with soured milk in a hot vehicle. :S<br /><br />Other than that, my little one likes it.<br /><br />*Note: This sippy cup with handles is exactly like the one without them. The handles just come right off, and it can be used with or without the handles. When the handles don't line up with the spout, you can easily pop them off, and replace them in the correct position.",

            "question": "title: Easy installation; not secure to wall\ntext: [[VIDEOID:94720c5f1799afb8e70f5a14a91309e6]] I personally like the gave for the purpose I had in mind: keeping two Shih-tzu out of the living room. It is 90% metal and 10% injection molded plastic/resin. I feel that if this gate is used by a single person, and with patience, not hurrying, or forcing the latch, it should work. Because it is a plastic, spring loaded mechanism for the latch, a family of 4 or five, and lots of thru-traffic, I can see that the mechanism would likely fail quickly. I will come back and make an update should the gate fail. There is a registration card for this Gate to register your product.<br />I would NOT put this at the top of stairs since the pieces that are on the walls are slick, not rubbery, and do not cling. Pressure over 15lbs or so will make this gate move. A toddler, medium dog, or someone trying to get through and losing balance would definitely risk displacing the gate from its placement, and falling down the stairs. If the gate can be placed at the bottom of the stairs, away from the staircase, but blocking access, that would be the best location. The other option is finding another attachments online that anchor the gate to the wall with permanence, like long wood screws or drywall mounts.<br />The latch need to be worked in two steps. 1. Push a spring loaded button 2. Press a spring loaded button. The springs are hard for arthritic thumbs to work. There are screws on one side of the latch where the mechanism can be accessed and replaced. I like this feature.<br />The gate can open in two directions, but small stoppers on the bottom of the gate can be flipped down to secure the gate to be only accessible from one side. This is a nice feature for stairs, if you anchor it properly. It is also nice when you have small dogs who want to dart through it. Opening it towards them gives them less of a chance to dart through.<br />As far as how \"sturdy\" this gate is, it is as sturdy as it will be treated. If a 100lb dog jumps on it day after day, it won't last. If 5 people are passing through it 25 time EACH every day, it will not last long. However, for pricepoint, and material(not wooden, not all metal, not professionally installed), it is more sturdy than I expected. The bars are bigger in diameter than I expected, and they are welded in place on a metal framed gate door. Many gate have the bars loose, and many have one side of the gate being plastic.<br />This gate has replaced a piece of unpainted, old, plywood. After a year of moving it back and forth, I decided this was better. The plywood protected the molding from the puppy through teething, and allowed her to scratch to no avail when she was left in the kitchen. This gate will hold her in, and will allow easier access to each room. It took me a total of 20 minutes to unbox, remove the plywood to the garage, place the 4 pressure pieces in place, get all four pressures to work to make the gate frame square, and then to clear away the box, two extra rods and plastic extensions for a larger doorframe. My doorframe is only 29 inches wide because this is an older home, ranch style. I did not need to read the directions to install this gate - it is simple.<br />Please view the video(not professional, but plain-speak), if you want a closer look.",

You stick them anywhere, but the best places are neat light sources. If you go to bed near sundown, that would be windows, and if not, the best places are near lights you turn off last before bed, as they need to “charge” to shine (unless you have a blacklight or UV light on). Anyone expecting them to be super bright without lighting them first doesn’t know how these work—it’s an unrealistic expectation. These work fine if you use them as intended, and of course, if you want them bright, you can alway just turn all the lights on for a few minutes or shine a flashlight close to them for better results.<br />Fun!",

We purchased this for my son's Legare Frog Twin Bed which due to the nature of the head and foot board, the bed cannot be pushed up against a wall (I didn't really think about that prior to purchasing the bed OR just one rail). Anyways, after getting the rail I was a little worried that it wouldn't work on a bed without a box spring. My 2 year olds bed has just the frame and a mattress but due to the long \"arms\" of the rail that go underneath the mattress I was still able to use it. The frame of the bed keeps the rail secure and tight against the mattress. There are no gaps and I can even lean my 103 pound body against it while napping on the bed with my son and feel completely safe. This product is well made. Instructions were a little confusing at first but just following the numbers in sequence and you'll be fine.

            "question": "title: It is triple French milled thus very good for sensitive skin and those with skin allergies.\ntext: This soap is perfect for sensitive and delicate skin. I used this for my 5 yrs old son who has eczema. His skin easily dries out and I moisturize it a lot and I am in search for a soap that would not aggravate his eczema. So far, this super mild soap is working for him. This also doubles as a shampoo. The lavander scent is very faint, almost unnoticeable.<br /><br />The best thing about this soap is that it isfrench triple milled. French Milled soap is known to be the finest quality. Not only is it plant based, but it is smooth on your skin and so gentle that it lathers very easily, even in hard water! The milling process is key to achieve the level of quality and homogeneity. Further, triple milled soap is a type of soap that has been passed through three rounds of steel rollers. This step removes any air bubbles and excess water from the soap, which helps it to last longer and lather better because there is more actual soap than water. Most importantly, French milling removes these traces of lye, and the soap, after rinsing, ensures that dirt and grease is gone. This is very beneficial to those with oily or sensitive skin, or those with skin allergies. Definitely recommending it!",

            "question": "title: I wanted to love this monitor... but I can't.\ntext: It has every feature I wanted: 2 cams, split screen, pan/zoom/tilt, talk, VOX, large (4.3in) screen on the parent unit, night vision, the list of great features goes on- you can even record those precious moments to an SD card.  It should have been perfect, especially at this great price.  Except for two things- two really important things.  'Thing the First:' the range!  The sleek, lovely parent unit would cut out once the nursery door was closed, which is simply ridiculous, as there was a mere 25-30ish feet and an inch thick piece of wood between the signal (cam) and the receptor (parent unit).  So there is a giant sized antennae that we popped upon the parent unit and that would be a better signal unless someone walked between the unit and camera.  Meaning if I or my spouse crossed the living room or walked down the hall.  Very puzzling and disappointing.<br /><br />Now for 'Thing the Second:'  the incessant beeping.  O save me from that horrible sound.  Every time the parent unit loses the signal from a camera that it feels like it should be detecting the beeping starts.  And you can't stop it.  You can't mute it.  If the parent unit is already on mute the beeping still happens at exactly the same level of sound, despite your desperation to shut it up.  You can click through the menu desperately trying to get something to change and the beeping will continue as you struggle to find the beep setting, or get the unit to pair with the camera or anything, anything to stop the sound.  I forgot to mention, the only thing in the box besides the units and cords is a quick start guide.  You have to go online to download the full manual.  So there's no help right off the bat as you fumble through unfamiliar menu choices with the beeping, the beeping, the beeping, ringing through your skull after a long day of devoted parenting.  And if you un-pair a camera, it will shut up, but I unpaired the wrong camera and had to sneak back into our daughter's room to press the pair button on the base of the camera in her room while trying to get the window of opportunity correct with the parent unit's scanning for a camera while muffling the horrible beep to keep from waking her.<br /><br />Well, thanks for letting me vent.  One last 'Thing', we use a Vornado Baby air purifier in the nursery as it's perfect for white noise so we can party down while the baby sleeps.  (Read 'party' as vacuum, wash bottles and groan loudly as we finally sit down in the evening.)  And when I chose this unit I felt the only risk was that the sound of a baby talking or crying wouldn't carry through the unit over the sound of this pretty powerful white noise.  I've tried a couple other monitors that failed this test and we have a Summer Infant monitor that is able to make out the baby voice and filter out the white noise nicely, but we are expecting Baby #2 and wanted to upgrade.  This Motorola unit couldn't really do that, sadly.  The sound would cut in and out more than the video signal and would have been impossible to sleep through as the signal stuttered and translated soothing white noise into a high pitched sputtering.  So there you go.  Again I thank you for letting me vent about that beeping.  I needed to get it out. Oh one more 'Thing:'  cam unit cords are a little short.<br /><br />1)  Poor range<br />2)  Shouldn't have to press a 'pair button,' just automatically scan for cams<br />3)  WHAT is up with that incessant beep<br />4)  Should filter white noise better<br />5)  Come on, I need the manual, in paper, I'm just from that generation<br />6)  Please make the power cords on the baby cams longer",

I was under the impression you did not need to use any bags which was weird for me at first, because I thought I was going to get stuck washing the pail every couple of days due to no bags but it says to use regular tall garbage bags. The \"lock\" seems cheaply done. There really isn't anything special about it. The top still comes off with or without the lock but that's maybe because again, it arrived all messed up. It looks like it could've been a nice piece of the nursery, but if shipping alone made it all messed up idk how it will hold up with an active house hold.

It is 100% cotton so it should be a lot softer than it really is, which really surprised me quite honestly.<br /><br />The blanket is however a good size so that is at least good. It is on the thinner side so you have to use it in layers to really give you some \"thermal\" warming effect with this.<br /><br />Sadly this was a let down.

            "question": "title: Great for wipes; not airtight for long wipe storage; top feels like it will break\ntext: I am a bit disappointed in this wipes container.<br /><br />This fits baby wipes or antiseptic wipes that come in packages similar in size to baby wipes. They will not fit tissues because the box is smaller than a tissue box. This box is attractive and is made of sturdy plastic. It has a silicone seal around the area where the rim of the box meets the top but there is no such seal around the dispensing hole, so it is not airtight. What really annoys me is that the act of lifting the lid cover causes it to creak. I feel like one day the door is just going to fall off.<br /><br />The lid only lays lightly on top without a silicone seal, so the wipes will dry out over time. This means that unless one is using the wipes they put in the box on a daily basis, they will have to be thrown out or rewet with water.<br /><br />I find it best to remove the wipes from the packaging and then enclose them in this box.<br /><br />In summary, the container fits baby or hand sanitizing wipes. It is attractive but is not airtight. The lid hinge is its weakest point both from keeping the wipes moist and because it appears like it will break easily. The current price of $11.39 ($11.99 minus 5%) is competitively priced for this.",

            "question": "title: Health-conscious parents won't want this toxic stew anywhere near their precious babies\ntext: I am shocked that Cetaphil has made such a chemical stew of a lotion, especially one marketed at babies. Let me just start with this fact: The fragrance stinks and the greasy, sticky texture feels awful on one's skin.<br /><br />Many people still use \"baby oil,\" which in long-time formulas like Johnson's Baby Oil has the primary ingredient of mineral oil scented with a strong, toxic fragrance. If you are planning to use a baby oil product on your baby, the best possible oil you could use is organic coconut oil (or any other organic, edible oil). I think coconut oil is ideal because it has a wonderful, real coconut smell, none of that awful, chemical fragrance that is so often put in baby products like this one.<br /><br />There is another benefit of using an edible, food-grade oil as a baby moisturizer: if your baby pops her fingers in her mouth which have coconut oil on them, or you want to moisturize her lips, which can get very chapped from baby drool, you don't have to worry about her ingesting awful chemicals into her body.<br /><br />Another benefit of coconut oil is that it is antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal, so it is healing and soothing on diaper rash and also helps prevent it.<br /><br />If you are worried about using a food oil as a moisturizer making your baby's skin greasy or sticky, you won't be avoiding that issue with a greasy, sticky product like this one. One way to get natural, food-grade oil to absorb more deeply into baby's skin is to give her a massage every day when you moisturize her. This is just one example of a book on that subject: [[ASIN:0756602467 Baby Massage: the Calming Power of Touch]]. It's even more wonderful for a baby to be massaged than an adult. It's soothing and healing, and helps bond parent with child and makes baby feel loved and secure.<br /><br />I usually like to include in reviews of products like this one a description of each of the chemical ingredients it contains but, frankly, there are so many chemicals in this product, my review would end up 2000 words long if I included descriptions of them all! However, if you are reading this review and you have a strong interest in learning more about any of the chemicals in this product, simply ask me about any of them you would like to know about in the comment section and I will post that information there.<br /><br />In all, there are over a dozen chemical ingredients in this product that I wouldn't recommend that an adult expose herself to, and would never want any of them near any precious baby in my care.<br /><br />Ingredients: Water, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbitol, Isopropyl Palmitate, Octyldodecanol, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Glycerin, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Hexyldecanol, Hexyldecyl Laurate, Panthenol, Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Fragrance, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Sodium Hydroxide, Dipropylene Glycol, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Squalane, Propylene Glycol, Glyceryl Caprylate, Heliotropine, Tocopherol.",

This has helped reduce messes because snacks dont spill out of it. It isnt the easiest to fill with snacks, but if you have a large wide mouth funnel, or something like a paper towel roll, it makes it easier to fill.

No matter how healthy they are, a parent will worry about this baby. This monitor saved my daughter’s life. One night, the alarm went off letting me know that my daughter wasn’t breathing. It was the scariest moment of my life. I rushed to her.. and it was right she wasn’t. I called her pediatrician (I was able to startle her away) and she sent us to the local women’s and children’s hospital where we would spend the next 5 days. Turns out she had reflux horribly and she aspirated on her spit up. While we were not a SIDS risk… had it not been for this monitor, we might not have our baby girl with us today.<br /><br />This model is great. It is easy to use. The screen is perfect and I can see her clearly. The mat is easy to use as well. You just put it under the mattress and you are good to go. I would recommend this product for everyone.

It comes with the non-skid kneeling pad and the elbow pad that lays over the tub and has pockets on either side for toys and suction cups to hold on to the tub. In addition, it also comes with six lovely squeak toys. <br />This set does not feel like it is made of neoprene like other sets are. Instead it feels like water resistant cloth which is not as easy to clean.<br /><br />The suction cups secure tightly to the tub. The mesh pockets on either side of the elbow pads allow for storage of toys and other incidentals. On one side the pockets are more of a netting material and on the other they are more solid mesh. The interior (toward the tub) can be used for toys and the exterior to hold washcloths, soap, shampoo, etc.<br /><br />This is not only for washing children during bath time but can be used by people, like me, who have to wash out litter pans or pets in the tub and prefer a soft surface on which to lean. Since the knee pads are separate from the elbow pads, they can be used when kneeling is desired when working close to the floor, etc.<br /><br />The current price of $29.99 ($31.99 minus $2) is competitively priced for this small set. I personally prefer a larger set that costs about $8 more. I have reviewed others and they are usually priced in the $ 26 to $ 30 range. This set works well but it is best for those with smaller spaces or who do not want to spend the extra money for a larger one.",

The assembly instructions in the manual are horrible and incomplete. I just looked at the box front and assembled it in less than 10 minutes. The pad has little cloth nubs on it that get hooked into the base per my video.  A remote is included and both the remote (requires 2 AA batteries) and the gym's speaker face (requires 4 AA batteries) require a total of 6 AA batteries NOT included. All items snap in place except for the batteries which require a tiny Phillips screwdriver.<br /><br />To get full functionality out of this unit, there is a learning curve. The manual has the image of what all the controls mean on Page 9. However, only Page 19 to 22 are the English instructions. There looks to be about 50 different combinations of controls to play piano sounds, various light sequences, to jazz music, and animal sounds. I just tried the simple stuff.<br /><br />Bluetooth pairing is available. I paired it with my iPad and then went to YouTube to play a Rick Astley song through the gym's speaker as shown in my video.<br /><br />I recommend using this under supervision only because the halo that goes around the unit is loose and I would be afraid the rattles will fall on the baby.<br /><br />In summary, this gym is super simple to assemble as long as one does not even bother to figure out the incomplete assembly instructions in the manual. The user needs to supply 6 AA batteries and a tiny Phillips screwdriver to complete assembly. There are a lot of musical and light features on this unit but there is a learning curve to understand all the features. The unit can be operated via the remote or the faceplate speaker. The faceplate speaker can be attached to a crib without the gym. There is Bluetooth ability that provides one with the ability to play music from their own personal music library or the Internet. In fact, you can even play the news from the Internet for the baby if so desired--although \"baby\" will probably get cranky with that. Do not leave the baby unattended on this mat for safety reasons. Overall, this is a nice baby gym with many features. The current price of $49.99 is also competitive. This gets 3.5 stars from me.",

Also, needing gate just x2 week- I was looking for something easily retractable when not in use. This particular safety gate was the longest length and least obnoxious that I found in my search! So, if you have a wider girth to protect from small children- this is a solid option. TBH, I’m surprised how difficult it was to find a gate fit for a wider opening!<br /><br />Installation is not the easiest in the fact, you must be precise! Having said that… They do provide all the necessary tools, instructions to let you be successful on the first try!! MOST IMPORTANT HELP I FOUND was the “how too” video smack on the product page itself. It wasn’t until I watched quick video that everything written made sense. Don’t overlook this as a valuable tool if you're struggling to interpret instructions. You’ll receive needed hardware (screws and extra wall mount bracket- a nice touch!) and your template paper.. YOU must provide tape measure and screwdriver (or drill) to complete the install- total time 30 minutes.. post reading instructions and viewing quick video!<br /><br />I appreciate the gate is minimalistic in design using straight, sleek lines with minimal bulk- and a thin panel hides gears and mechanics. Made in white this blends best placed on a wall of like color- for us, we have painted walls so, this is pretty blatantly just there.. Truth be told- I missed this needs permanent Application as I mistook template for adhesive.. just know you will be drilling into baseboards and sheet rock! Oh how I wish someone would invent the baby gate that didn’t leave a mark!<br /><br />Keep in mind if you have an aggressive toddler this isn’t full proof, it’s a fabricated screen and therefore- when in place children will be deterred but, they still need a watchful eye! As of now, I have confidence this will hold the little 18mo old in safely.. Something to keep in mind for your need and age of child needing protection. Love how this has retractable screen with lock mechanism and can be done x1 handed.. mechanics seem to work perfectly and as one would hope.<br /><br />Definitely an option that can step up just as it says it will- A few things to consider prior to purchase and if it will fit your criteria!

I tried the Pampers Cruisers as well but found they weren't much better than the Baby Dry and cost more so I stuck with the Baby Dry.

We immediately stopped using those and I figured all Huggies were like that so I stuck with Pampers.<br /><br />I got a sample of these, the Huggies Supreme Gentle Care, and found they had better stretch around the legs (didn't dig into my son's legs and leave indents), had good stretch around the back and went up pretty high to help prevent anything from leaking out, and held a lot!  We used to use seperate Night Time diapers but after using these, this is the only one we need.  These have never leaked!  We had the Pampers Baby Dry leak a couple of times during long car drives when we couldn't change often and a few times during the night time.

These types of toys are so beloved because they stimulate the senses and a relevant example is this sheep from Wow! Stuff CoComelon Toys.<br /><br />Lots of toys light up and make sounds, but this one is unique. You place the sheep on a specific color, and it lights up to the same color. Then, it starts to sing a song and it says the name of the color within the song. This is above and beyond other lighting and sound- producing toys and it is a cool concept for certain.<br /><br />As much as the qualities of this toy sound impressive, it does have a flaw or two. The greatest issue I have is that the included color strip is nothing more than a piece of paper with different colors! The problem is obvious: it’s only a matter of time until the paper rips, gets lost, gets crumpled, etc. It would have made more sense to have laminated this, but I guess the manufacturer wanted to save a little money.<br /><br />The success rate for the sheep is generally good. Sometimes, it is slow to register when it’s placed on a different color and it may or may not change color as a result. You may need to lift it up, then place it back down again, to get it to register the exact color you want.<br /><br />It's cool that this CoComelon toy lights up with different colored lights and states the name of the color because it can help young children learn. But the cheap inclusion of a paper strip and the spotty reliability of the color- changing mechanism convince me to rate this toy average overall. It’s a great idea, but needs some updates to improve its rating.",

            "question": "title: Very uncomfortable and bruised my shoulder, but decent if you find a better shoulder strap solution.\ntext: 3.5 stars<br /><br />I use another Skip Hop bag for regular outings, and I LOVE it, but this one looked like it might be a better option for some of our slightly longer outings, like trips to the park or field trips(Adventurous, aren't we?!). ;) Having an insulated spot to keep water cold was appealing, along with being able to wear it messenger style.<br /><br />After using it, I have to say that I'm a bit disappointed.<br /><br />First of all, the strap is horribly uncomfortable. I'm amazed that a shoulder pad wasn't included. Depending on how much you put into the bag, it can bruise your shoulder! It did mine. We tried this bag out at the park, during a nature walk. I put a few *mini* bottles of water in there, a few sandwiches, a couple of notebooks, some art supplies, and the other necessities(allergy meds in case a wasp stings my son, phone, keys, lip balm, etc...small stuff). It really hurt to wear! If you use the hand straps, it might not be so bad, but I wanted it for the messenger style feature.<br /><br />The insulated part is small. I was only able to *stuff* a few mini bottles of water in there. It will only hold one regular sized bottle. You don't have to use it as an insulated spot. It comes with 3 little containers that screw on top of each other. One of them includes a formula cap, which doesn't have to be used and can easily come off. These are great for snacks, and unless you put cheese or something cold in there, it wouldn't have to be insulated. The insulated pocket is rounded for these to fit perfectly in there, though. The top canister has a little handle attached, so it is easy to grab the whole canister set, and move about.<br /><br />Another feature of this bag is the fact that you can unzip the front to see everything in the bag, and it's not so dark digging around in there. This is a great feature, but make sure when you take advantage of it, you prop something up in front of the bag, so it doesn't tip over. It does so easily, and all your stuff will come falling or rolling out(that isn't zipped in a compartment).<br /><br />As a regular, everyday bag, this one is on the huge side. My children are now 3 and up, so I don't have a baby, but I wouldn't have wanted to carry a bag this big when I had little ones. For outings, it's decent IF you find an extra shoulder strap solution and pack light. There are lots of little pockets and spaces to put things, and until you get used to it, it'll take you longer to find what you're looking for in all those little hidden away spaces. If you develop a system, though, and remember where things are, it's actually pretty nice to have a specific spot for everything.<br /><br />Overall, this bag has some nice features, but I'm amazed it was left without shoulder padding. This is really a huge problem for it.",

With an insulated interior, we can put in a little freezer pack and keep even a bottle of water chilled for us.  Shaped like other saddlebags, it lacks right angled corners in which little items often get lost, and the exterior mesh is very good for keeping dirty or damp things without messing up what's carried inside the bag.

Definitely better for toy storage than clothing storage, though it would be helpful for things like shoes, swimsuits, etc. where actually seeing which different items are inside is helpful.<br /><br />It also doubles as a great robot helmet in a pinch.

These are the type of brainchild products we love to see.. something that gives one a solution to a problem- by utilizing items we have in the home.. The common denominator needed is the microwave and an easy order of these sterilization bags!<br /><br />These baga allow in reality for five bottles, nipples, neck and spill caps to truly fit into one specialized pouch at a time. The good news is, most infants won’t usually use more than 5 bottles give/take in a day… Allowing sterilization to take place each evening and be ready to fill bottles again for the following day! At least this is what we have found to be true…<br />I Purchased these for my baby sister who is a first time mom, living in an apartment as a newlywed- and all without a dishwasher! Something she’s has never missed except, when it came to washing and deep cleaning their infant bottles… for someone who lives on a very tight budget, these bags sold for approximately $8- Will give her 180 sterilizations, before needing a new box- that is a deal, a solution.. and peace of mind to her and those who are helping to guide her!!<br /><br />Do not be intimidated by instructions or the “how to” with this product! The information is broken down into very simple steps and what I appreciate most, each step is accompanied by a simple explanatory picture.. so, one doesn’t even need to know how to read! You can simply follow the instruction photos and do this no problem!!<br /><br />As for outcome- in reality it’s difficult to say that it’s doing it’s job without a litmus test. However, I can tell you the temperature and physical process alone gives me great confidence. This is a great solution for any who need a way to sterilize baby feeding products.  **Hack: when certain baby toys are put in mouth on every occasion- A really good way to sterilize is placing on the top rack of your dishwasher. Any toy without metal, could also be sterilized in these bags… Giving the same results for germ free baby product! I hope this info can help your decision… Feel free to let me know!",

            "question": "title: Contains corn syrup solids\ntext: It’s funny, doctors and nutritionists would freak out if we suggested feeding 7-Up to our nine month old, yet this toddler formula has corn syrup solids as the third ingredient. Why in the world is this necessary? I have had issues with milk supply, and have had to supplement with 1 to 2 bottles per day to make sure my baby got enough food. So many of these brands contain corn syrup, especially the ones for babies who have a sensitive stomach, but I have been using the Enfamil brand of premium formula, which doesn’t contain any corn syrup products at all. So I was disappointed to find that when transitioning my baby to a toddler formula, this same brand expects me to feed him such junky food.<br /><br />Since I personally avoid corn syrup and a lot of the types of oils that are contained in this formula in my own diet, I fail to see why I’d want to feed my toddler this stuff. I hope this company will take note, and develop some toddler formulas for people like me who would like to avoid feeding her baby unnecessary junky sugars. Lactose is the type of sugar that is in milk. Why not just include lactose?<br /><br />That said, this stuff does mix up easily, smells better than the premium infant formula I have been using, and doesn’t leave any weird greasy residues. Plus, I’ve yet to find any toddler formulas that don’t contain corn syrup products, so given that, I’m glad this brand does have a product to transition from infant to toddler formula if I find that necessary.",

On the plus side, it's unscented. There's a bit of a \"soapy\" scent to it, but it is so faint that it's accurate to call this unscented. It is gentle and has not caused any irritation whatsoever.<br /><br />On the downside, it's quite watery -- it's almost as thin as water, which makes it harder to use than thicker washes. You also end up having to (or inadvertently) use more than you would with a thicker consistency wash.<br /><br />The packaging is odd. It's a plastic bottle, but it comes wrapped in a thick cardboard-like shell. Packed inside the shell (if you peel it off) is a package of seeds (Sweet Basil). To my eye this looks like a manufacturer that is trying to focus on packaging waste, but going about it in a \"trendy\" manner that causes more waste.<br /><br />I could see the benefit of the cardboard wrapper if the soap was contained in a flexible pouch that uses less plastic than a bottle, but this has the waste of both a conventional (but somewhat thinner) plastic bottle and plastic spout plus the waste of the cardboard. Since the seed package was not mentioned on the label, I'm sure that a lot of the packets get tossed because the customer didn't even know they were there. More waste!<br /><br />The cost is quite high for such a small amount of watery cleaner. While it's a five star product for the lack of scent, overall formulation, and gentle nature, the watery consistency, poor value, and misguided packaging puts my score at 2.5 stars.

            "question": "title: Not only a play mat, but a flexible educational toy\ntext: These types of soft play mat are almost a required accessory for those with babies or toddlers, because they spend so much time crawling, rolling, and sitting on the floor playing that it is nice for them to have a softer surface, especially for those of us with hardwood or linoleum floors. I also love it because I have a Summer Infant Pop 'n Play Portable Playard which is a large playpen where the bottom sits directly on the floor, so if you put it down on carpet it is fine, but not so much on linoleum, where if baby trips he can really bonk himself. I appreciate that I can set up this mat in a corner of the kitchen and put his play yard on it to have a softer play surface.<br /><br />I really like that the colors are simple solid colors that are easy to use for teaching. We can talk about the yellow square, the orange square, and the blue square, and it is helpful for him in learning his colors. The colors are more muted than shown in the photo, which I think is of benefit. It is an attractive set and does not make my home look like a preschool exploded on it.<br /><br />But what really surprised me about this mat is just how much fun we have had forming 3-D foam cubes and playing with it that way. My son loves picking up the foam cubes we make and carrying them around the room. We also have some lightweight foam building blocks, and my partner has actually started piling those foam building blocks inside of some of the foam cubes we are building with the set, and our toddler is just ecstatic when he figures out how to open up the cube to get his foam building blocks out. He also likes shaking the foam cubes and hearing the blocks rattle around inside. We even built him a little wall for him to hide behind out of foam cubes, and my partner made himself a helmet to wear out of the foam squares, which delighted our baby.<br /><br />While I thought this would be an item that we would use for a very specific period of time when our son was still a baby or toddler, the fact that you can actually build 3-D foam shapes with this makes me feel that this has the potential to be a flexible educational toy for years to come. I received this item as a sample for review, but I'm so pleased with it that I will certainly be checking out more from this brand.",

            "question": "title: BPA-Free airtight plastic storage for milk powder or other foodstuffs; dishwasher safe\ntext: This is an airtight plastic storage container for milk powder / baby formula. The enclosed scoop holds about two teaspoons--it does have a tiny hole on the bottom of the scoop. The scoop can be seated on the inside cover as shown in my photo. I personally love the handle on this because it makes it good for traveling.<br /><br />The little tiny \"shelf\"  or scraper can be removed if desired. This is normally used to level the scoop. Note that this is BPA-free and dishwasher safe. I do not use the dishwasher, so I cannot vouch for that.<br /><br />This works as designed and can be used to store more than baby formula, such as loose leaf teas, coffee (of course hole in scoop may be a problem), snacks of nuts or dried fruit, etc. Since there is a hole in the scoop, some formula will fall through and that is to be expected. The current price of $11.68 ($12.98 minus 10%) seems on the high side of competitively priced for this.",

There are QR codes that link you to a video guide for assembly, as well as an instruction booklet inside the package. There are packing instructions on the box, which means they make sure you get all the required parts. The loops attach to the mat via Velcro and slide through an attached loop on one of the hoop arms (I missed this and thought I didn't get it, it just slid to the bottom of the arm). It comes with four visual and noise making teethers that have plastic hooks to attach to the arms. The piano needs AA batteries to run and connects to the mat via the fabric hooks. The piano mounting mechanism is one flaw that is easily broken. There is a small plastic piece that is supposed to lock into the multiple angle positions. If you force it at all it snaps and then will glide freely between the positions without locking. I did this on one side, luckily not the other. So it still mostly works in each of the angle positions. Otherwise this has good built quality and is cute. Excited for my newborn to start playing with it.",

First, the legs are too short so that the stair is practically under the bowl.  Then there is the issue that the step is too narrow as well and makes it impossible to turn and sit down.  So pretty much the only usable part we had was the handles, but then that becomes useless as it keeps my son sitting upright or slightly leaned back so he pees right over the teeny tiny lip onto the bathroom floor.

Besides, 99% of the time, if I want to use the monitor I'm in the house.<br /><br />The DXR-8 does not require wi-fi or an Internet connection, and provides a secure digital link between the camera and the monitor.  Great.<br /><br />We've been using this monitor since our son was born, now over 2 years, and it's been in constant use without issue - The picture/sound is everything we need at night or day, the pan/tilt feature of the camera works well and is silent.  The battery life on the monitor is also good; certainly enough for an evening.<br /><br />After 2+ years of 365 day/year use the USB charging socket on the monitor developed a fault, but Infant Optics kindly offered to replace it free of charge, even though it's outside warranty - Their customer service is outstanding and the turnaround was swift.<br /><br />In short, if you're looking for a non-Internet baby monitor, this is it.  I've bought 3 or 4 as gifts over the last couple of years so prevent friends having to make the same decision ;-)",

The plush animals are so well made and detailed;  it's difficult to choose the one you like best.  The leaves glow as they rotate, and, along with the stars on the ceiling, and the moon, that's almost enough right there to lull baby to sleep.  The tunes are clear and soft - my personal favorite is Brahm's Lullaby.  Again, these things alone would make you want to buy this.  But, add the remote control, which enables you to turn the mobile on and off without entering the room and disturbing the baby.  I like the fact that the control panel can be either inside or outside the crib.  Have I forgotten anything?  The nature sounds...again, it's difficult to choose which is more soothing, but the baby will make that choice.  I can imagine this mobile keeping a baby occupied for a good long time, or encouraging sleep when baby is ready.

I use the liners to pump to store for other feedings and to freeze. To freeze a stash I used someones advice on here to freeze the liner with the rings on.Once frozen I put that liner (and any others from that day that are froze) intoa  freezer bag without the rings. This way I can store a stash without using a ton of rings.<br /><br />A tip with this method: If your milk freezes and you cannot get the collar down,pinch the top of the liner and come from the top. I froze a couple and though I had to just defrost and use right away since I couldnt get the collar off. Once I became rested enough, I realized that I should just take it off the other direction :)<br /><br />One other tip. Use the walmart brand liners. I tried Playtex, Target and Walmart. Not only are the walmart brand ones the cheapest, but they are the most sturdy! I am able to put the liner with no bottle attached upright with any amount of milk in it. I had problems with the other ones if there was only a little milk in them.  The bottom of the walmart liners appears harder which might be the reason why they can support themselves better.",

It's nice that it has versatility, but I'd consider this mainly as a baby scale and not an adult bathroom scale.<br /><br />Operation is straightforward and doesn't require referring back to a user guide to figure out how to work it.

My kids are now 4yo and 6yo and we just got back from Florida and my fair skinned children were the only ones that didn't burn.  I will note that I don't use this on myself anymore except on my legs as the formula will break out a teenage or an adult but works great on my small kids.  We also use Babyganics stick for the kids faces.  If you don't want your kids getting burned and something more natural, this is the stuff for you!<br /><br />UPDATE 11/4/2016--<br /><br />We used this sunscreen all summer again on my two fair headed children as did I.  We went Florida and as long as we were wearing this, we didn't burn at all.  Does leave white marks if not rubbed in good enough.  Note, you won't get much tan as this stuff really does the job.  Also, they make a spray version of this that I actually love better for those touch ups.  This version is thicker than that but both work nicely if you don't want a burn.<br /><br />Favorite Sunscreen for the kids!  My kids have super sensitive skin and I also like to use more natural and eco-friendly products so this fit the bill.

I even use this on myself when we go to the pool now.  It really does block the sun.  My friend and I went to the pool and we lotioned are kids up around the same time and hers managed to get sun where mine didn't get burned at all (might I add both my kids are extemely fair skinned with one of them being a red head).

It’s simply a lightly filled blanket with an attached pillow case that rolls up and is portable with the attached clips to keep it all in place. It’s perfect for my preschooler to snuggle up on the floor and watch a movie, but it’s not exactly cushioned in the way a mat would be. It’s definitely overpriced for a blanket with a pillow attached. I really love the look of it though and it's cozy. I also washed it before use (I removed the pillow inside first), and it came out great.

The seat is adjustable so it can grow with them. Of course they don't spend years and years with a toy like this but for how much they use it while they can, I think it is well worth the money.

Where the embossing is done, the thickness is very thin, but this is because the light fleece in applied with a seal.  Think of how a vacuum sealer flattens the two layers of plastic bags when sealed and you can get an idea of the dots that make the embossing on this pad.  I have no problem with this, but do find that if your baby is like the Princess who is disturbed by the pea, this may be bothersome as she tries to sleep.  For playing, I don't think she would be bothered.  Since most babies are not like that storybook princess, I think that this pad is a nice addition to help maintain the mattress.  This can be machine washed in cold water and dried on low temperature but I do not dry mine since in my experience, that reduces the effectiveness of the waterproof ability.

I got this cot through Vine, and the one I received is blue, assembled, no castors (wheels), and standard size 23&#34; x 52&#34; which is about 2 ft x 4 ft 4 in. This should be long enough for most children even up to age 7 or 8. It holds up to 75 pounds.<br /><br />The cot has steel poles, making it very strong. The bed portion is made of stretch-resistant fabric which is a kind of meash. It is very easy to clean. The bed is only a few inches off the ground, so there is no worry about a child falling out of bed and getting injured.<br /><br />If you get a cot without castors, which is the type I got, the holes on the bottom of the cot which are made to insert castors will go unfilled. To be safe, in order to prevent my 18-month-old granddaughter from putting her finger in any of the holes and getting hurt, I put duct tape over the holes to seal them off. For someone buying the cot, I recommend choosing the option of the cot with castors, and the problem won't arrise.<br /><br />This product is stated as being &#34;certified for reducing chemical pollutants.&#34; Be that as it may, this product does outgas, and I suggest leaving it outside (hopefully out of the rain, though that probably wouldn't hurt it) to air out for a few days.<br /><br />All in all, this is a product that is both practical and a lot of fun.

He LOVED it immediately. There are lots of things to spin, shake, sort and listen to on the front panel. The wheels lock so it doesn't fly out from under early walkers, and can be released to roll freely for those more confident tikes. It really did help him with his balance, and eventually he was able to weave in and out of obstacles with this. I think it helped him walk a little better early on, and now that he is running everywhere I have retired it to the attic because he has other toys that are stationary that do the same types of things this one does. He took the little barn door off and loved to chew on that thing, it may have been his favorite part. And the phone rattle. So cute! All in all this was a good purchase and very durable.

It comes in six pieces. I found the rods difficult to snap together as it takes a bit of elbow grease to secure them in their tracks. In fact, it depends on the desired height as to whether the center arm needs to be installed or not. Although there is no manual that says this, it appears it can be left off.<br /><br />I decided to install everything. I also had to put in two AA batteries (NOT included) into the music box. A Phillips screwdriver is needed to install the batteries. The plush toys hang from the hook on the music box. The box plays 35 lullabies. There are only four controls on the unit -- ON/OFF, M for the rotation of the motor and play list, and the increase and decrease volume (which is also used to move to the next song). A long press of the M button starts and stops the rotation; a short press plays a single cycle and two presses sets the list cycle play mode.<br /><br />At the current price of $18.99 ($19.99 minus 5%), this is a nice mobile. The instructions are lacking, so I do not consider this giftable unless one attaches a copy of the operation instruction card on the Amazon site.

Until he was 9 months old he didn't fit in it properly, we had to put a large, firm, pillow under it just for his feet to touch something (he's average weight & height). He liked the toys and music fine but he couldn't really bounce yet.

My first child was in an exersaucer at 4 or 5 months and loved it until 13 months (plus, he used a door jumper that he adored). This jumper with my second kid was unsuccessful. They need to like the toy enough before they start crawling to continue wanting to be in it later, which wasn't the case for our son.

These fit perfectly with the middle car seat rear-facing or forward facing. The issue then became the lower seat belt.

We bought two seatbelt extenders and problem solved.<br /><br />I'm not impressed with the quality of these seats. The covers are okay. The cup holders are genius- they are small and out of the way, but easily usable when needed. These seats require assembly, which is not something that made me feel very comfortable. Seems like there is too high of a risk of user error for something so important. The plastic of the back seems very flimsy. Maybe it is because I am not used to these lower end seats, but I was not impressed. However, they do fit in my vehicle and they do properly position the seat belts on both of my boostered children.

I havn`t had any problems with it. It looks great and is big enough to hold all your baby needs without being super bulky. Also, it does not smell like most neoprene does. The changing pad really is very small. I actually just gave it to my daughter to use for her dolls and bought a large changing pad instead. Not a big deal and still worth getting the bag!!!! Love it!!<br /><br />Update:<br />Loved the bag until the seams started splitting and it ripped within a week of using it :( Loved it otherwise but a diaper bag is going to have to last longer then that!",

I purchased a medium by going to the Burt’s Bees website as there’s no sizing chart offered in the description. There’s plenty of leg room & I expect the blanket will be used long-term. The design was spot on. The material is soft. It’s not heavy, it’s thinner than I thought it would be though. Not as thin as a bed sheet. I expected it to have more thickness to it since it’s described as a “blanket” & “sleeping bag.” She lives in FL so I’m not too concerned about the baby not being warm. It’s unfortunate the zipper design is from the top to the bottom. If changing a diaper in the middle of the night it takes the warmth off the baby by having to zip it down rather than just zipping it up a bit to get to the diaper. The zipper is of good quality though. The material also bothered me as it’s advertised as 100% cotton but the fill is 100% polyester. Yes this is Burt’s Bees a brand loved & trusted. Why not make it fully 100% cotton. I recommend being aware of why I gave a 4 star rating.",

            "question": "title: Have a hand rail? Have baseboards? Read this.\ntext: Do you have a hand rail? Read this. This product is okay. There are specific parameters that need to be met in order for this to make sense in your situation. This isn't evident or obvious from the description nor the unrelatable imagery used by the seller. Essentially, you will want to have aprox 3 inches of flat and clear wall space, extending from the floor to ~3 feet high, at the top of your steps. Three significant considerations: 1. If you have a baseboard, especially one that might trail your steps and meet at the top of the steps at an angle, you might have a difficult install. 2. If your banister encroaches on the 3 inch area, you will have a difficult install. 3. If you do not have a stud at the install site, you will find the product to be of questionable sturdiness.  4. If you transition from wood to carpet between the stairs and the floor/landing, the support-foot (visible in only one picture, but necessary for the install), will prevent/impede the gate's swing action. I encountered all four of these issues in my installation, and would not buy or install this product again. What appeared to be a simple and straight forward install rapidly became an involved project to trim a banaster, extend the baseboard, reinforce the installation site, and make adjustments due to wood-to-carpet transition between steps and top landing. In the proper install site, I can easily see a better appreciation for this product. However, as advertised, this is not a simple solution for just any household.",

I found dog diapers on amazon and they looked just like reg baby diapers but worn like a skirt instead of how you put it on a baby . I figured for the price I’d be better off buying these in sz 4 and they worked so well !! They keep my lil dude dry and he can walk around without any issues. It’s so much better than using puppy pads for him to lay on . These work great on my 12 lb dog . I think a sz 5 would work too . He’s built like a little tank . These have the line on them that let me know when he is wet . They smell really good too ! I used these for my kids when they were babies . Still great quality for a great price . I’m super happy with how well they absorb pee . My little old man dog was stinky and needed a bath daily when I was using puppy pads under him to keep him dry but it was not working very well . These keep him dry and he’s not stinky like he’s making Jenkum . Now I can use just the diaper and a fabric Welping pad to keep him comfortable, clean and dry . It’s his golden years right now and quality of life is the most important factor right now . I think it’s cute that my dog is wearing his little diaper wrap that has a bunch of dogs printed on it (paw patrol )  . In my experience these work great on both fur babies and real babies !",

Each only is individually packaged in this set.<br /><br />The baby lotion is a bit thin, though not “runny”. It is smooth, lightly scented, and definitely moisturizes. I loved it SO much, I bought another tube. And, at the time it was about $6. That’s a pretty decent value for a name brand such as this.<br /><br />The rash cream is something that we use sparingly in the home. And, yes … even adults need a cream like this due to high PH in the urine as well as during that time of month if they use pads. According to E! Online, it even helps with razor burn on legs or other areas.<br /><br />This cream is a medium consistency. It isn’t oily, greasy, runny, or thick. And, a little does the job.<br /><br />The vitamin cream works on mildly dry hands, but is suitable for the whole family.<br /><br />In short – this really works for the ENTIRE household.<br /><br />As far as the price? This set is currently listed at $18.50. The products here on Amazon run about $5.94-$5.99 each, so if you’re looking to shave a few cents off – no pun intended – I’d get them individually.",

The edges are serged, so they do show wash and wear a little more than a nicely finished edge, but about the same as my other prefolds. They do not fluff up like a typical prefold. They stay pretty trim, like a flat. I imagine I’ll switch to using them as doublers when my baby gets a bit bigger, but at 8 weeks old, these are plenty absorbant enough for now.

After two years, using it on average twice a day for nap time and bedtime, I'd say we got our money's worth. Some people may think the sound is too loud even on the low setting but I disagree. We use it on the loudest setting and it works just fine for our kid. It seems loud to us but works great to cover up TV sounds and voices from other rooms.",

            "question": "title: Made in China. Overpriced. Nice but a couple of issues. Not completely spill proof.\ntext: It’s a cute little 6 oz cup with handles as well as a lid and straw, all made of silicone. The lid does not screw on. You just press the lid down or pull it off. As  your toddler grows, you can stop using the lid and it becomes a comfortable drinking cup.<br />Two minor cons:<br />1.  There is one confusing thing I haven’t figured out how to solve it. When I put the lid along with the straw on, it always force a little liquid out through the straw. The reason is because there is air inside the cup, and as you press down, you are forcing the air down, therefore it is forcing the liquid somewhere, causing it to go up the straw.<br />2.  My toddler is used to straws but wasn’t drinking from it. I decided to try it and discovered that if I try to drink with the straw touching the bottom, it is like a vacuum seal, like trying to suck a thick milkshake through a straw. You have to lift the straw up slightly to be able to drink it.<br /><br />Another thing to consider, it is not exactly leak proof. My toddler would tip it over. Sometimes there is a small drip leak near the straw, sometimes not.<br /><br />Other than that, it is a great toddler cup!<br /><br />Made in China. At the current price of sixteen bucks it's crazy overpriced.",

It also is amazing to use with each diaper change to ward off moisture and prevent rash. It smells amazing also. He has no known allergies so we have had no issues with this cream.<br />It is in a metal tube just so you know, I didn't realize it and it can be hard to get all the paste out as it doesn't bend and squeeze easy. So make sure to squeeze from the bottom always and roll it up as you go.<br />We have used every brand of conventional creams that are available at walgreens and places. I usually just toss the tube somewhere and say &#34;well let's try another one&#34; because he only gets a rash maybe once a month if even it is bad when he does, when I wandered onto this cream here on amazon I figured there was nothing to lose so....now I will order multiples each month.<br />Amazing cream, rash gone in hours and excellent moisture barrier with regular diaper changes.",

Opens up a diversity of flavors, and may be more appealing (and yes, inclusive) to parents that work with these foods as part of their own cuisine. I love this. Thank you.<br /><br />Probably better to work it in a little at time, or mask the stronger flavors with something that they already like. Or it could be they love it at the start.<br /><br />So it comes down to preference because the quality seems great. I tried a couple of varieties, and I am impressed with how robust the flavors are, and how I can pick out each flavor; ie I can taste the curry, I can pick up on the mango, celery, etc. If your kiddo (6+ months) doesnt like it, then eat it yourself. Add to a smoothie, or squeeze into some broth or over rice, or in a burrito, etc. Or eat direct from package, use it as a quick snack on drive home. Stuff like that. None going to waste here!

The dinosaur base comes off, the head comes off, and the toothbrush tip on the other side of the head comes off. In total there are six pieces. Although this is a toothbrush for ages 3, 9, and 18 months with a dinosaur storage base, I do not like that the brush can be pulled from the brush handle with the possibility of swallowing it.  A parent must use extreme supervision if using this especially since this unit is so engaging.  This is just my opinion anyway.<br /><br />This is made in China. The current price of $17.09 ($18.99 minus 10%) is also on the high side of competitively priced for this.",

            "question": "title: Ergo at 1/4 the price\ntext: I tried several types of carriers when I had my second baby, including the Moby, Sleepytime, and K'tan. I didn't like any of them, so I thought we'd never be able to find one that worked. I took a chance on this one once my little one could hold up his head, and it was the best $30 I've ever spent. It's pretty comfortable for both of us, even when he's now 21 pounds. We started using it around 12 pounds (though the product says 16+) and didn't have any problems with the front carry. One thing I really like about this design is it is ergonomically supportive for baby's groin, unlike some of the other carriers, that separate the joints too much for comfort. That could potentially impact proper development if you wear your baby a lot. I wore mine most of the time until he started walking. It's comfortable for plus-size. I think the belt goes up to 50&#34; or 52&#34;. You can wear it around your hips or waist. This is like a generic Ergo. Not quite as fancy, but works pretty well. I tried out a friend's and found them comparable, with this being $100 less. The downsides: I gave this four stars because-- You can't put this on by yourself unless you're a 90-pound gymnast. It works fine for larger frames, but you're going to always need someone to buckle the strap on the back if you wear him/her on the front, or help settle the baby in the back-carry position. Baby can only face against you, so he can't turn to look out as well as he can in some carriers. I never could get the side-carry position to work. The carrier just didn't seem stable enough that way.",

This means I don't feed him anymore, but he wants to sit like anyone else, not in a high chair. This means I am usually cleaning up a mess from him either not paying attention, spilling the bowl etc. I have tried regular place mats but the food usually misses it as he likes to hold the bowl.<br /><br />This however is different. It's a silicone bowl/plate that is attached to the place mat. It's heavier than you would expect, but that holds it in place on the table. The place mat catches most of the food and the bowl can't be picked up from it, so he actually leaves it there while he eats. However, be sure you serve once it's already in place instead of carrying it to the table. It's awkward to try and hold when it's full of food.<br /><br />It goes through the dishwasher fine, I usually put it on the bottom rack along with everything else and it comes out clean and ready to go.<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT (IN ORDER TO TRY IT AND REVIEW) THIS DOES NOT GUARANTEE A GOOD REVIEW OR CHANGE MY OPINION ON THE PRODUCT, I AM HONEST AND UNBIASED, ALL OPINIONS ON IT ARE MY OWN AND BASED ON THE PRODUCT ITSELF.

Yes, the Baby Jogger 2016 City Mini Double and Baby Jogger 2016 City Mini Double strollers are both up to date with safety compliance, something very important to me.  I currently have both models and can describe the basics of both and what enhancements I've experienced with the GT model over the basic model.  Both are the simple black, but they are available in a number of options, each model has one color that is specific to the 2016 models and was not available in previous models. Both strollers are fabulous for a pair of kids under the weight of 50 pounds each and five years of age.  The fabric is UV protected, each seat is adjustable on its own and recline so one child can sleep while the other enjoys the environment.  Bars and trays are available as additional purchases, as are an assortment of other accessories.  Both offer a quick open and close, we find that they do require two hands.  Each has a fantastic five point harness that is comfy for the kids, as are the seats.  Both offer a pretty smooth ride and look good.  Where they differ is that this GT model weighs a few pounds more and is a little larger.  The tires are all terrain, not the EVA as in the basic model.  This model has an adjustable handlebar, a definite asset for us since none of us adults is tall and we can now be more comfortable when pushing the stroller.  The brake is on the bar, not on the bottom area as it is with the basic model.  My critique of the basic model had two things I wished were different, the tires and the handlebar.  With this model, both of my wishes have been granted and more.  The strollers look very much alike and until I pushed the stroller, the difference was not really obvious.  As soon as the tires rolled, I felt that this one was well worth the additional cost.  If finances are a concern, you can spend more for either model in a color other than black or you can get this deluxe model in black and enjoy the additional features.  I say to go for the black and get this GT model.  The suspension is enhanced by the all terrain swivel tires which can be locked for longer rides, just like with the other model.  This is not a lightweight stroller, but then neither are two kids, so we work through the weight carefully lifting both.  Assembling this stroller and familiarizing ourselves with its operation took less than a half hour.  This double stroller is not intended for jogging.  We have had no problem doing some fast moving across the sidewalk and lawns, up and down hills with ease.",

            "question": "title: nice combo for newborns\ntext: I purchased this for my new and first grandbaby!  :-D  My daughter was thrilled with this choice in carseat and stroller combo.  We chose this because Evenflo is a known and trusted brand.  Purchasing a carseat is not something to play around with.  You want something that is sturdy and works.  I guess your mileage may vary and opinions differ but we really, really liked this setup. For a newborn to one year, this combo is perfect.<br /><br />This carseat has all the bells and whistles.  Easy car installation on the base.  Carseat clicks in and out easily.  Of course there is a learning curve on how it all works, but the instructions are seemingly well written and we found what we needed to find.  My daughter likes the SensorSafe feature that lets you know about unexpected unbuckling, unsafe temperatures, the child is left unattended, and the child is seated too long.  Personally, it would be too much technology for me, but again, my daughter loves it for her baby.  She is impressed by this technology.  The little adapter is attached to the carseat with a ziptie if you are looking for it when unpacking.<br /><br />The carseat with baby is a little heavy but I don't know how you get around that.  You want sturdy in an accident and babies are chunk-a-munks.  Add the two together and you will be carrying some weight.<br /><br />The stroller holds the carseat perfectly, snap in, snap out and sturdy.  The stroller folds down pretty easy and fairly compact.  The stroller will grow with baby to a certain point.  Perfect for newborn to one.  One to two will probably work.  Toddlers will probably need something a little bigger to accommodate them.  My girls had a sit and stand stroller which are still around and I highly recommend.<br /><br />As for longevity.  Sorry, we cannot speak for that just yet.  So far so good.<br /><br />I guess that is it.  Any regrets?  None.  I wish they had this beauty when my daughter was a baby.  Recommend?  Absolutely.",

            "question": "title: Perfect for our needs and does double duty!!\ntext: This is a smaller size toddler pillow… one made smaller for the convenience and use while traveling  yet, it can be used on a day-to-day basis and for a few diff. purposes.<br /><br />In our house, I am providing nanny care x2 days a week for my nephew and needed pillow small enough to fit inside a bassinet now and transition into the play/pack later. This toddler travel pillow is perfect for my needs.<br /><br />I am loving the fact this is a firm but, comfortable pillow purposely made without a lot of excess “squish” or, material that could be a hazard to an airway... yes! infants don’t usually need a pillow at all- As, I’m using in place of a wedge to help prop baby at a slight angle (like a rolled blanket or, foam under bedding can do!).. With a bassinet the pillow had to be of smaller size to fit and this is a perfect fit! The pillow can also allow one to help prop a bottle as they grow a bit over time. After a quick few months- I will easily transition pillow into a baby head rest when he sleeps. *Why the reason behind one item performing multiple things.. ?? bc, I don’t need an entire baby arsenal of gear for baby duty only x2 days a week. The least amount of items is best- so, if one item performs “double duty” and can change with baby, it’s a plus.. and those babies we all know, grow really fast! This pillow can now be a staple for us over the next 1yr plus for sure..<br /><br />Size: don’t expect toddler bedding- Think adult travel pillow.. boom, that is it! With the exception it has been constructed for toddler use and boasts a whimsical print. We ordered blue- and love the fun elephants.. it’s perfect for a baby who’s from Ghana!!<br /><br />Material: has solid stitching, no loose thread and no hard edges. It has an envelope style closure… Fabric is soft however, has the newness/crisp feeling sheets can have when they arrive. I used fabric softener x3 machine washes prior to use and found.. it just gets softer every time- just like I wanted. I’ve now, washed x6-7 and have had no issue with color fading.. just keeps softening! No exposed or, outside stitched tags either to scratch babies skin..<br /><br />Purpose: obviously pillow can travel with ease and fit inside most diapers, suitcase or, duffel bags. It’s perfect size to take to grandma‘s house or, hotel! Nursery pillows also add a fun aesthetic to decor in any room.. and this, placed in rocking chair looks fansastic.. not to mention, provides support at small of the back- which, is a big relief in our wooden rocker! I hope this info can help your decision.. feel free to let me know.<br />*included photo helps show the difference of using pillow to create angle vs. standard flat. As you can see- photo on left has a curve.. travel pillow used created the needed positioning.",

I'm not able to test the baby bath tub myself, as I have carpal tunnel in both hands which causes me to drop things a lot. It would be a disaster if I dropped my grandson.

            "question": "title: Great for assisted feeding for your cat or small dog\ntext: I am very happy with this product.<br /><br />I bought the 10cc size. It came with two syringes, both the same size but with different tips that have different sized openings.<br />The reason I bought these was to hand feed one of our cats who has kidney disease and had stopped eating from his dish.<br />We weren't going to let him starve to death because of kidney problems! (Special note... if your cat has kidney disease, s/he also likely has a very sour stomach that keeps them from wanting to eat (sort of like a tummy flu). Ask your vet about something to help with that. There are holistic helps as well as a people medicine that can help, both OTC.)<br /><br />I was a little worried about being able to squeeze the syringe without overloading food into my cat's mouth.<br />However, the plunger works very smoothly. Even my hand with two &#34;bum&#34; fingers (repetitive-use cysts on the knuckles) can push the plunger without excessive force.<br /><br />For pet feeding, the food does need to be liquefied to thinner than oatmeal quality to work. I use the one with the wider tip for feeding our adult cat. It is much easier than the squeeze-bulb style syringe I was using before. The flexible tip is gentler on his mouth and tongue, and I have much better control over how much is given at one squeeze.  The measurement markings on the outside allow me to better know how much he is actually getting into him as well. I just put the tip with the plunger all the way down into his liquified/pureed food and pull the plunger back to fill it to the desired level. If you get too much air in the tube, just hold upright, tap, and push a little to force the air out.<br /><br />The plunger and tube are super easy to clean:  just pop them apart, run hot/warm water thru the tube, rinse the plunger, and push a couple tubes of water through it. I then leave the pieces separate to dry out, and by the next meal time, they are dry and ready to use again. I don't advise using soaps if you are using these for pets - many are super-sensitive to soap residue tastes.<br /><br />The smaller tip has a graduated sizing that gets pretty small at the end. While I don't need this one, I could see it being very useful for dispensing milk to tiny kittens or liquids to even smaller pets, such as a hamster. It is too narrow for foods, so that tip would be good for liquids only. You could always trim it if you needed the opening a little wider, but you'll be losing length, which could affect being able to get it into your pet's mouth.<br /><br />Both tips are a soft, flexible silicone and are much nicer for my pet than the hard tip of the bulb syringe I was using before.<br /><br />While I wish I didn't need these at all, I am glad someone makes them!  I am very pleased with both the quality of the syringes and the user-friendly function of them. (Anyone who has tried to use those syringes with the black inner tips will know what I mean... they are hard to push and unpredictable as to how far it will glide at any given time.)<br /><br />Well done, Innovet, and thank you for helping me to help my cat.",

They are trendy and different then the common bright/colorful baby designs.<br /><br />She used them for almost a solid 3 months. We washed them regularly and sterilized them in boiling water (recommended for long term use) Because the pacifier is 2 pieces, water would still get in, which was a bacteria concern.<br /><br />Just recently one them (that she used the most) has physical signs of wear and has a very sticky feel to it. I thought it might of been from the milk, but I washed it in soapy water and it still felt sticky.

It also comes with a cupholder, but it is the side kind that hold on by one little knub. Water bottles always fall out of those. My only real complaint is the difficulty in folding it. It has a little switch, but you have to maneuver and try multiple times to get it to \"catch\" fold down. Unfolding it, there is a lock you have to unclip and then it unfolds easily.

They like things around them - it's why they will sleep for hours in their car seat but wake up as soon as you put them in the crib (at least mine does). Swaddling with a regular blanket can be tricky. It can be difficult to do and then easily come loose. It can also be an issue because you are not supposed to put a blanket in with the baby in the crib.<br /><br />I liked these. It made it so much easier to swaddle her. You just put her in it and Velcro and you are done. I still don't put her in it alone in the crib at night, but just to use while I am holding her. It also can make it easier to breastfeed because sometimes she inadvertently loses the latch because she is moving around so much. This seemed to calm her down. It's nice that it comes in a set of two. They were soft and had nice designs. These are a little more boy colors, but I use them for my girl. The whale print is cute. I also think this would make a nice shower gift. I would recommend them.<br /><br />This is the next step version of the original swaddle for when the child is older. It is nice because you can choose whether to have the child's arms in or out. It is also nice because it has a zipper at the bottom, which makes it easier to change a diaper. Many of these swaddling things are only for the youngest of babies so it is nice to have something for an older baby.",

They like things around them - it's why they will sleep for hours in their car seat but wake up as soon as you put them in the crib (at least mine does). Swaddling with a regular blanket can be tricky. It can be difficult to do and then easily come loose. It can also be an issue because you are not supposed to put a blanket in with the baby in the crib.<br /><br />I liked these. It made it so much easier to swaddle her. You just put her in it and Velcro and you are done. I still don't put her in it alone in the crib at night, but just to use while I am holding her. It also can make it easier to breastfeed because sometimes she inadvertently loses the latch because she is moving around so much. This seemed to calm her down. It's nice that it is a neutral color and will work for a boy or a girl. I also think this would make a nice shower gift. I would recommend them.",

Plus, it doesn't really seem like the pockets are insulated-they would be slightly protected from heat because they are completely inside the main compartment of the bag-but I never tested it.  I currently use an older Skip Hop Grand Central which I love but it's wearing and I wanted something a bit more summery.

I bought 2 Avent bottles for our son to use while my mom watched him for our anniversary.  He was exclusively breastfed & only used 1 bottle, that 1 time.  When his doctor suggested starting him on sippy cups with a little bit of water (6months), I really didn't want to run out & buy something else that would take up more space in our cabinets.  I bought these guys & the handles.  Our son loves the handles, but has really struggled with the spout.  I would go so far as to say he cannot drink from it.  I eventually caved & bought 2 Nuby 2 Handle Cups with Soft Spouts.  He can drink out of the super soft spout much easier.  I do wish this product would have worked for him because when I screw on the Nuby lid, the spout does not align with the handles.  The Avents *always* align.  To sum it up, I am giving it 4 stars even though it didn't work for our family, because (1) I love that Avent offers a modification for consumers, (2) the handles rock & the spout & handles align super easily, & (3) my baby is exclusively breastfed & has very little experience with bottles (1 bottle, 1 time) - I believe a baby who knows how to drink from a bottle would have a much easier time with this product.",

We purchased because the seat cover removes easy and our daughter gets sick in the car easy but I will invest in a steam cleaner just for her Britax. It does not have a removable cover at all, only the headrest from what I read so that is a downside. The cost with the accessories is $500. This seat is budget friendly definitely and much safer than many car seats you can find at Walmart or other places. Nice seat just not safe enough for us.",

This has got to be one of the most useful new gadget around!! Nannying a newborn for a week while parents travel.. I’ve absolutely fell in love with this little gadget it’s a total game changer!<br /><br />1. For babies kept on a set schedule- either waking themselves or mama waking to eat.. This has clock timer that allows you to be “bottle ready” at your chosen specific time is. WHAAA..!!!<br /><br />2. For those who prefer a few minutes to change a diaper, situate in rocking chair, go potty.. you start warming process once baby cries out and as you complete tasks- you’ll have “bottle ready” for feeding.  WHAAAA…!!!<br /><br />3. Or those little one who tucker out at the start of a feeding they will need- quick cat nap to gain energy to finish bc we know their hungry.. Choose  temp. you’d like to keep milk acclimated too and it stays “bottle ready” thru their cat nap.  WHAAA…!!!<br /><br />Whatever night routine 1,2,3.. this gadget is such a perk!! Instructions are easy + straightforward, control button are back-lit with LED display so easy to navigate in the dark.. i find it white noise quiet and won’t disturb sleep of anyone in the room. The small footprint lets this sit nicely on nightstand or place of choice.. I prefer bedside to truly keep me from going to kitchen to fuss with any of it!! I say let all the perks work FOR you! **Place a protective layer (placemat) under device to keep wood extra safe.. If kept/cared/stored properly- this could be an item to last thru all child rearing years!!<br /><br />At $40- it’s worth it.. sleep is priceless you get very little of it!

The screen is clear and easy to read, it comes with a nice storage stand to keep it protected when not being used, and the manual is very detailed and specific as to how to use it. It comes set up to use as an ear thermometer but can also be used to take surface temps.<br /><br />It is powered by two AAA batteries, which are included. It automatically powers down to conserve battery life.<br /><br />The bad news is that actual usage is not all that convenient. It is a rather fussy thermometer to get it to provide accurate temps. It has to be positioned very carefully in the ear, and the disposable caps must be intact. The latter is a problem since several of the caps that were included (it comes with 2 packs, each containing 15 caps) were not properly formed and had gaps at the tip.<br /><br />While some measure of care with regard to placement is necessary with any ear IR thermometer, this model is far more fussy than others I’ve used. Unless I placed it exactly so, and pulled (gently) on the ear of my (somewhat) willing test subject to position the probe, I would get readings a little above or below what I should have measured. It was difficult to use even with a (somewhat) willing test subject – it would have been even more difficult with an actual sick person, especially a child.<br /><br />Given the price point, the fussy nature of this thermometer plus the fact that it can only be used with the HealthSmart brand caps (which can be defective right out of the box) makes this, at best, an average value. The screen, overall ergonomics and storage stand are all pluses, but even with those I can’t see this worth more than a 3-star (average) rating.

We have food, water, and most importantly a litter box in that room for her.  Therein lies the problem.  My dog loves the tootsie rolls she finds in the litter box and eats all the cat food she can get her mouth on.  What to do?  I searched the internet for ideas.  Put a book behind the door that I can reach in and move out of the way.  Put a washcloth under the door (didn’t work on carpet). There are some expensive gadgets out there but then I found this one.  It works perfectly.  My only regret is that I haven’t had one of these through the years of raising kittens and puppies.  We can leave the door open just enough for the kitten to go through to eat or use her litter box.  And, as she grows, it’s adjustable to make it longer so a bigger cat can go through and it will still keep the dogs out.  Because it’s just a lightweight strap, you can move it easily with one finger for quick access to the room.  When I work in that room on the computer I can easily reach through the door and hook it so only the kitten can come in.  This is a great invention.  The adhesive is holding tight and we open and close that door many times a day.  I would highly recommend that product to anyone wanting to allow limited access to a room.",

I do not like the fact that they raised their price in just a month. But that will not take any stars away from it. Think about it this way. if you use any other wipes your baby will most probably get diaper rash and you will have to buy the cream and all to fix that. To me the cost of doing that and using these wipes alone equals out. Thanks for making a great product. Just please dont get too greedy and raise prices on these. If the price stays resonable I will keep buying. I bought mine for $48. in october 2013 in november tehy went up to $55 already.

I've used prefolds w/ covers, AIOs and pockets.  Personally, I really like pocket diapers and bought a used stash of high-end diapers for my first child.  As she was the 3rd child in that set, I knew I would have to buy some new diapers for the stash and replace some very worn ones.<br /><br />After looking for used high-end brands, I ended up taking a chance on these cause I really needed more in rotation and I have to say - I am blown away!  Granted my original stash is used, but these seem to be just as high quality for literally A THIRD OF THE PRICE!  After pre-washing 3 times, they have been extremely absorbent already, zero leaks and a lot of flexibility with fit.  I thought the inserts may be cheap or shoddy, I have my own I was thinking of using, but honestly they are great too.  I use one insert and it even withstood nighttime use.  Obviously may need to use 2 as he gets bigger, but I was surprised it worked as well as it did with only 1.<br /><br />Within days, I have ordered another set.  With this price point, I can replace most if not all of my stash.  I cannot speak to durability, but even if I had to replace some of these in a year - I am still paying less than high-end new and likely to still come under high-end used.<br /><br />Also to anyone new to cloth, I love to suggest Grovia cloth wipes.  Having all cloth is simpler and they work fantastic as well - some are 3+ years strong.",

Most other hair bow packs contain only the basic colors, usually eight or so, but you get thirty with this package.<br /><br />These bows hold in place by use of the attached alligator clip. The clips are larger than expected and they hold the bows in place with ease. They hold in place well thanks to their teeth. Some bows don’t have the teeth and can easily slip. You won’t have that problem here.<br /><br />As for the bows themselves, they are tied into an attractive shape and the soft material is nice enough to touch, although this shouldn’t be a concern since they will be in your kid’s hair, and not touching the skin.

            "question": "title: Some of these items hit the mark, and some not so much\ntext: This is a really fun gift set, but the combination of items is a little strange given the age range covered. For example, there is a sippy cup and a traveling snack canister, neither of which will really be used until a child is about a year old, yet there is also a traveling bottle cleaning kit that has a brush and a drying rack. It seems a little incongruous, because most kids aren’t drinking so much formula or breast milk at that age that you’d need to carry around your own personal drying rack and cleaning brush. Surely that can wait until you arrive home?<br /><br />I absolutely adore the traveling baby wipe dispenser, so much so that I purchased a second one so I can keep one in my car, and one in the stroller. I love that I don’t have to keep buying little disposable travel packs of wipes, or keep some huge thing of wipes that is constantly drying up in my vehicle. That’s a product that is useful from day one.<br /><br />I also really appreciated the little oxo spoon. It doesn’t hold much food at all, so is perfect for baby’s first meals from about age 6 months to nine months or a year.<br /><br />The sippy cup and snack dispenser are very well designed. The snack dispenser has little flaps to keep the fruit or whatever you put in there from rolling all over the floor if the baby bangs it against something or drops it. It won’t keep all of them from rolling out, but it does a pretty good job. That said, I kind of wish the sippy cup were made of glass or stainless steel so that I would feel comfortable letting baby drink things from it over a more extended period of time. I’m not that big on drinking from plastic containers.<br /><br />I also liked the stroller hook, which allowed me to run out to the co-op and pick up a few groceries while on the walk with baby, and bring them home easily. While some groceries fit underneath the baby seat, it’s nice to have the option to buy more than just milk and eggs.<br /><br />I think the baby drying rack and bottle brush is the one thing that I wasn’t too keen on. I guess I just didn’t really see the point. If I’m traveling, I bring enough bottles for the duration of the trip, and when I get home I clean them. Maybe if you go on a lot of overnight trips, this would be more useful. I did appreciate that the brush handle comes off so that you can fit the brush and handle inside the drying rack. But I guess I stick close enough to home that to me this seemed a little silly.<br /><br />Overall, oxo makes really innovative products and these baby products are no exception. That said, I would check the price carefully and make sure that you’re actually getting a deal by buying all of these things at once, because you may not want or need all of them, and perhaps you’ll save money just buying the few things you will need.",

Also, if your kid should sling it to the ground like ours does, it will splatter out a huge ring haha. But other than that, it's great. Better than all the rest we've tried.<br /><br />As for cleaning, cleans great. We toss it in the dishwasher. There is a tiny silicone ring in between the top lid portion and the bottom cup. It does accumulate mold over time, so take it off and scrub it. But make sure it gets back on. It creates a seal so that water won't leak out.<br /><br />Update: Now that they've released lids, we got those and you don't have to worry about anything pressing up against the lip and causes leaks.

So make sure you know exactly where you want to place this design before you get started.<br /><br />Because the different elements and animals are an artistic creation, and not photographs, they are all very crisp. The pieces are made of vinyl.<br /><br />This collection of decals are made in China and being sold by a Chinese company on Amazon. The same company offers a wide array of different sort of decals like this. All with different themes.

My son is still a little too young to understand the rewards concept in full. He likes putting the stickers on the chart. We have tried potty training him since he is 18 months and were almost successful until one week after they tried assisting in his toddler class at daycare. Not sure what happened but he stopped telling mom when he had to go. I was hoping this chart will do the trick. He uses the potty at home and when on the road on weekends but not at daycare (EPS1). I will retry this chart when he is a little older and still not potty trained. For now I will continue my efforts without repurchasing since we used up the 4 weeks without success :(.",

My thought was that this Bubula diaper pail would foil them with regard to the trash can in the master bath. It's rather pricey for my purposes on the surface, but considering the vet bill for a dog who has foolishly ingested cotton balls, it's worth it.<br /><br />This can isn't heavy enough or large enough to really work as a family sized kitchen trash can and it requires too many steps to use efficiently while you're cooking. In the bathroom though, it's pretty darn good. It holds a standard 13 gallon size trash bag and it definitely keeps any odors contained. We tested that function with a small bag of empty tuna cans overnight - no tuna smell at all. The dogs haven't been able to open it or figure out how to get into it yet either. I've included a photo of the opening where you put your trash. That peanut butter jar is about as large an item you can dispose of. Anything bigger requires opening the main lid and that in turn, releases the odors that the can is containing. However, for diapers or smallish stuff, this is a pretty good product.",

First, you can freeze basically anything in them and I've had good luck freezing homemade juices including lemonade and juices I make in my juicer. The caps on this brand have permanent plastic sticks in them so you don't have to buy wooden sticks all the time. They also sort of catch some of the drips although don't count on it.<br /><br />The disadvantage is that you can't just pull one ice pop out of a tray you have to put the entire tray in a bowl of warm water to release the pops. I found them nearly impossible to pull out without doing this and setting them in warm water for thirty seconds usually does the trick. Then you can just put all the ice pops in a plastic ziplock freezer bag for storage.<br /><br />Here are the two \"juicing\" recipes I've used lately. There is a enough juice for the ice pops and a few cups of juice leftover to enjoy:<br /><br />Recipe 1:<br /><br />1 pound strawberries<br />1 pineapple, peeled<br />2 Pink Lady apples, unpeeled<br />2 oranges, peeled<br /><br />Recipe 2:<br /><br />1 pineapple, peeled<br />2 oranges, peeled<br />2 apples, unpeeled<br />1 (6-ounce) container blackberries<br />1 cup grapes<br /><br />For both recipes cut the fruit to fit your juicer and juice. Pour the juice into your frozen treat trays. There are really unlimited ways you can make juice so you can have fun experimenting all summer long.<br /><br />You would think this would come with a nice recipe book but only three recipes are included. You can mix yogurt with fruit in your blender or freeze applesauce, chocolate milk, egg nog or puddings.<br /><br />While these are fun for kids adults will love them too. I went out walking in the heat and it was so good to have some ice pops ready on my return.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",

            "question": "title: Probably easier to install on lever handles that are nearly straight\ntext: Another product that didn't bother to include instructions. I guess it's a fairly obvious what to do: you peel the backing from the base of lock and position the lock so that the handle cannot be pushed down when the lock's arms are out. Test where to place the lock before removing the backing and sticking it on. The distance between the arms is 1.5&#34;. The base is 4.75&#34; tall by 2&#34; wide. When the arms of the lock are extended outward, it measures 3&#34; from the base to the tip of the arms. When the arms are down against the door, the lock measures 3.25&#34; from one edge of the base to the opposite side. Each arm can be unlocked and moved separately. They can even be locked in a partly closed position, though I don't know why you'd want to. You press down on a button (which is easy for an adult to work), move the arm to the desired position, and then release the button to lock the arm into position.<br /><br />Our house is full of lever doorknobs, and we wanted to use these to prevent my toddler niece from getting into certain rooms. They appear to work alright but were a little difficult to position. We have lever doorknobs that curve upward and then downward into a curl. I think these would be easiest to install on lever handles that are straight or nearly straight.<br /><br />Installation instructions from the product page: &#34;The surface should be SMOOTH....Please clean the door before you apply the lock, then peel off the 3M adhesive film and stick it to the right spot on the door, press it to make it fit evenly and leave it for 10 minutes before you start using the adhesive child proof locks.&#34; (I think you're supposed to use heat on the glue part of the locks when removing them?

So you are able to just take the snack cup inside to clean. It has a fairly tight grip when in place, but if your baby is determined they may be able to get the entire snack cup out of the holder. The top of the snack holder also comes off. It comes off pretty easy so if your child likes to open and close things then this top might not stay on for long. The drink holder is about 3.25 inches in diameter and has a few pieces of rubber to help keep the cup in place. The only thing you should note is that the clamp is in place. So, you will only be able to attach this to something that is oriented to fit the clamp. The clamp is tightened (or loosened) by turning the knob on the other side. Not bad.  Made in China",

Once I finally did order it I put off washing it for fear that the colors would bleed. Then one day my dog marked the rug, foam mat and baby gym all in one quick shot and I had to wash it. The color didn't bleed, I used cold water and a bit of oxy clean to get out the urine. The black did fade in the drier from a less BLACK black, to a more average black but the mat still looks great.<br />Also I loved the little hanging toys that came with the gym.

It pushes very easily and feels like a very smooth ride. It has a pretty decent compact fold. You just press 2 buttons on the handle to fold and unfold it. The basket is easily accessible, but is small, which is fine! It has a nice recline to it and the canopy has decent coverage. The leg part can either come up for a smaller baby or fold down. I love that the shoulder pads stay in place on the shoulder!! The adjustment piece is also under the pad and you can roll the excess up in the shoulder pad. Brilliant if you ask me! I definitely recommend this stroller to anyone, whether you travel or want to use this for every day. It comes with a rain cover and infant car seat adapter for a cybex car seat.",

After raising 4 kids of my own and bathing newborns in the sink… I stepped up as nanny daycare for my nephew- not to cause horror of bathing my sisters baby where I do my cooking, I decided to get this- if people are looking for ease and convenience, this isn’t it! For those that don’t know any better… They’ll appreciate it just fine, I’m sure.<br /><br />I didn’t like the idea of bathing a baby in a “glorified bucket“ personally, I had a hard time filling the tub itself and that may be just my own issue with the faucet too close to the wall!? But, it’s how my bathroom was made! I see the logic behind it it just takes so much work to make this happen… By the time I have it set up I could’ve had the child bathed and dressed- so, it’s not time worthy.<br /><br />The sling idea is a novel concept and that I do understand… You also need the outer ledge of the tub basin to clip this on. Well, If we can send a man to the moon why can’t we make a sling for the regular standard tub?? That would be amazing.. A defect with the sling, is the head rest! This creates a bump that naturally tends to push baby down and that gets their ears under the water- as a daughter of an MD that’s a no go in newborn world!!<br /><br />I’m sure the next phase with the upright seat will prove to work better… But, if they can semi-sit on their own then, I just assume hold them upright in the tub itself. This getup could be beneficial for those who have a hard time getting up/down at the edge of the tub and maybe Best suited at grandparents house or, the likes. **I can also see this being mandatory IF.. one has a house without a bathtub -then, it is not the worst option around..<br /><br />I do appreciate the accessories included… The watering can helps rinse babies hair and nothing in the toys is soft sided squeaky to retain water inside it. For those who don’t know- these suck up water and begin to grow mold immediately! Then, when played with the next time… Yuck and the gunk joins baby in the tub it’s horrible! No soft sided rubber duckies- no!! As for the toys in this set- here is a hack for you.. you can thank me later. Every few uses, run them through your dishwasher and they’ll be clean and disinfected- you’re welcome!<br /><br />I gave this three stars for the fact: some people may not have options for bathing baby.. and therefore, this could solve those issues. It has its perks and in the end can get its job done.. just not in the fashion I want- Quick, effective, efficient!!<br />I hope this info can help your decision… Feel free to let me know!",

It feels a lot softer than the SG brand and is much sturdier than EB (though I use EB diapers and didn't like the Naty diapers). Naty are sturdy and durable, and the aloe seems to soothe redness before it can become a rash--though I buy the regular kind too, depending on what is in stock. As a bonus, they usually come out of the package pretty easily. On the downside, the soft-packs tear easily, and I've noticed if you put them in a plastic container, they dry out more quickly. I just check the packaging every day, and if one rips, I pop the pack in a resealable gallon storage bag. I do wish Naty had distribution in a local store, but I've never seen them, even at Babies &#34;R&#34; Us. The Subscribe & Save option makes them affordable through Amazon, and it's convenient to have them delivered every other month without having to go to the store, so I guess it's not a deal-breaker for me that they aren't locally available.",

Even spent lots of pretty pennies on the more kid friendly salon quality stuff.<br />So with that said, I can definitely say this detangling spray is one of the best we have ever used. It really has been great so far. Plus the scent is very nice. A two-pack of spray is going to last us a while; but I am certain that I'll be back for more.

Trust me- That’s something I would do🤫..)<br /><br />Washing: it’s been posted to hand wash item only?Tbh, I did not see that anywhere in my instructions  or, on any tag..? So, I chose to try it in the machine. I’ve only washed x1.. and did so, on my “hand wash only cycle..” I did place this inside a lingerie bag- (my HWO cycle runs 13min. total w/ minimal h2o and LOW agitation/spinning..) results were as you’d expect a wet stuffed toy to look- However, one dryer cycle on delicate.. he came out fluffy, new + clean! *I’m sharing this in case, anyone is stuck in the y/n of machine washing.. it worked for me! (X1 knot was pulling loose but, easily fixed by a quick re-tie!)<br /><br />$$ is compatible to similar items.. I chose this snuggle because I needed the particular animal- the sloth! Hopefully, this info can help you as you make your decision on your purchase.<br />If this helped out in any way.. feel free to let me know..!!",

This alleviates the worries about her getting into mischief with the cabinets.<br /><br />They stick on via 3M strips and line up so they are incredibly easy to install!

            "question": "title: Large & exceptionally well-made child's playpen; 45-pc assembly easy but requires strength\ntext: For the current price of $99 ($129 minus $30), this playpen is an exceptional buy. It took me 1hr 15 min to assemble and then disassemble the playpen. I really wanted to see if it was portable and, although it can be easily carried around, I do not consider this portable.<br /><br />There are a total of 46 pieces (not counting the manual) and 45 of the pieces have to be assembled. The 46th piece is the supplied carry bag.  There are 8 each of the small, medium, and large rods. There are 8 T couplers, 4 top corners, and 4 bottom corners with suction cups. There are 4 colorful pull-up straps and the playpen itself.<br /><br />I watched the video on Amazon to get hints about the assembly but the manual provides a good idea as well. All I needed to know was which bars went where and I had no need to read the instructions. The 8 medium bars get installed in their channels on the short end of the playpen (meaning the width). The 8 large bars get installed on the long end of the playpen (meaning the length). The 8 short bars get installed vertically (meaning these are the bars that hold up the walls of the playpen). The suction cup corners are for the 4 corners that meet the floor. The 4 plain corners are for the top and the 8 T couplers are for the center connections.<br /><br />Installation was simple but it did take strength and sometimes turning the couplers to get them to seat into the hole. The last bar should be installed where the zippered channel is and once it is installed, the channel can be zippered up.<br /><br />There are 4 colorful pull-up straps and they just snapped over the top bar around any area of the playpen I desired.  There is a mesh toy pocket on the outside of the pen for storage. There are also two zippered doors. The zippers glide open and closed easily as I tested them several times.<br /><br />I broke down the playpen in reverse (zippered channel first). Uninstalling the pen was easier than installing it. However, the entire process of assembly and disassembly took me 1 hr 15 min. All items easily fit into the carry bag.<br /><br />In summary, this pen is large as can be seen in my photos. It took up most of my boyfriend's parlor. The pen is well made and very sturdy once assembled. There are two entryways. The zoo motif is also very attractive. Overall, I love everything about this playpen. It is exceptionally safe and the edges are covered for protection. Both parents will be able to fit in the pen. I consider this pen an excellent buy and the baby I got this for will enjoy it for several years.",

            "question": "title: Strong, does not fold, has chemical smell and add furniture pads on bottom\ntext: I received the Kinbor Baby Kids Step Stool for my 2 year old daughter that loves to help me in the kitchen. It came packaged securely with instructions to build it yourself. It was very easy and took about 15 minutes to put together. The instructions don’t get a step-by-step breakdown but you honestly don’t need one. It comes with the screws plus an Alan wrench. When fully built, it is 3ft tall and 16 inches wide.  It is fairly heavy and I was worried it was going to scratch my floors so I put felt furniture pads on the bottom which helps protect the floor plus making it easier for my daughter to push on her own. It is sturdy and safe. The platform can be adjusted to 3 separate heights. I have it on the bottom level which puts the backing about mid torso so no threat of her falling out. It can’t fold up so you do need a good amount of space to store this out of the way.<br /><br />The other issue I had is the smell. It was omitting a strange, almost chemical like smell, the moment I opened the box. I do have a sensitive nose and it is so strong that I have to store it in the garage. It is getting better and not nearly as strong but I can still smell it after a week of receiving.",

We have twins and take it to the in-law's home because they are not child proofed and have a wood stove to keep babies away from.  also we use it out on our deck, in the yard, and when we were replacing our carpets with wood flooring.  we have the octagonal gate because we bought the extensions.  the gate broke twice, once when I tripped and fell on it over a large toy and snapped it between me and the toy, and once we left it outside in a windstorm and it blew  off our deck into the neighbors yard which is a downhill drop.  we got the gate when they were under a year old and now they are almost 2 and we still use it.  it's big enough with the extension that we can all get in there to play, and in the yard they have fun in there but stay out of the road (we are a corner lot with no fence.)  We have also used it as a room divider. if you have a slippery floor (wood, linoleum) just put it on top of a big blanket or some of those foam puzzle mats.  it works great and won't scoot.  It took us several months to finish our floors and this was so helpful because they could watch us work on the floor on one side of the room while they played right there in sight.  One reviewer stated he wanted to set it up into a square, which is a bad idea: it is not structurally as stable as a square (if you buy the two panel extension, which I highly recommend) because the middle joints of the square shape don't have leverage when flat like they do when bent out. even a slight bend in the joint makes a huge difference. this is really a big play space, my husband and I are both tall and we can both get in there with the kids and play with them one on one with toys and when we have them in there alone it's really  enough space they don't care unless of course, they would rather be out doing what we are doing.  But when you need a safe space to put little ones in while you are doing something else, this has really been a great solution for us, I'm so glad I bought it.",

It's very well constructed and super easy to set up and take down. Though the Wayfarer is big and roomy it folds down surprisingly compact for it's size which makes for easier storage. The wheels are very nice and push smoothly over just about any terrain. There is plenty of room to spare, even with both the 2 year old and newborn riders. Now it is a bit heavier than most strollers at almost 35 lbs, and that can be a much to lug around for a quick trip to the grocery store. However, the Wayfarer is absolutely perfect for the beach or Saturday Market and even just a little Picnic at the local park. The handle is nice and cushioned and with how effortlessly this pushes or pulls, even fully loaded makes it actually enjoyable to use for long periods. Overall this is a quality product that has great value for those in need of a reliable well designed stroller wagon!",

My eleven month old wants to get into everything and be near all the activity. This is great because with almost zero effort, literally, three seconds. I can unfold or refills and pick up to take this into another room.<br /><br />It has a series of straps at the base that you clip to the edges so the floor is taut, but I don't bother with those because it makes the yard less portable. You can't fold it with the straps snapped to the edges. So the floor for us just wiggles a bit as Talvi walks or scoots, which is no big deal.<br /><br />It's also huge in comparison to other play pens. Twice the square footage. We leave it in the kitchen with a couple small lightweight toys and can easily fold up to bring into the backyard on the lawn or into another room.<br /><br />Someone commented on the screws on the sides but those are not particularly rough nor do they stick out far, so I don't think it's a safety hazard.<br /><br />You should know that this doesn't have a firm bottom, which is why it is so easy to transport. The bottom is just a flap of fabric do maybe can't lift the thing and leave, but there is no cushion or mattress and baby sets right on the ground, which is fine on lawn or carpet. In the kitchen you will want to only use it with older babies or a folded blanket down.<br /><br />I love this and wish we'd known about it sooner.",

Most of the parts have quite a bit of flex. That being said, it feels a little on the flimsy side compared the baby einstein walker we had.<br /><br />The height adjusts tabs are easy to use. The front wheels on this on are tiny. The rear wheels are little stiff. This walker has far better mobility on our hardwood floors than on our our rugs.<br /><br />I read the other reviews about babies getting their fingers pinched in some of the toys and decided against installing them for now. It doesn't take much imagination to see how easily that could happen. You can see the design difference comparing this to the other safety 1st walker where the similar toy has more room.<br /><br />One thing that I do like is that the corners have a lot of surface area for adding a foam bumper. That should help us with a little of the base board repair we had to do after the last one.<br /><br />One last note, there a few hard edges and excess material shavings that have to be removed where the parts where cut.<br /><br />Update: There are a few tabs that are used to hold attach the seat to the walker. These tabs are a bit long and they have sharp edges. There are two in the front right where the thighs are and can scratch the baby's legs.<br /><br />Update: My nine month old has been using this for a while now. We're on the second notch. Works good on our stone tile floors. I just have to pick up the rugs otherwise it gets caught immediately. We're using all the toys minus the battery. No issues in that regard.",

In the past I’ve propped the seat of the child up on a fence or rail, sometimes on the back of a chair to add some relief. With the pole I tote around my own relief.

The unit is about the size of a smart phone and both the Parent and Child units are shiny Star-Wars-looking shiny white plastic. The picture is quite good, and there's a two-way microphone should you want to speak with someone near the camera unit. The camera requires a 120V outlet to plug into. The Parent unit has a battery pack but also plugs into a wall socket -- the manual tells me that the Parent unit will operate on battery power, but for a short time only. Perhaps  so you can slip it in your pocket as you walk around your house? I'll have to sift through the manual to figure out the intricacies of this VTech camera and monitor, but judging from the quick start guide it's fairly robust and simple to understand. You can add additional Child units (up to four total) and then use &#34;Patrol&#34; mode which will go from camera to camera. The Child units also report on the temperature where they are. Very impressive overall.
