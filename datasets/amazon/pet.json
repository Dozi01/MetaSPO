            "question": "title: Great 3 filter system but you have to replace each filer often - costly to maintain.\ntext: Not quite sure how to change a filter yet - I guess I'll figure it out in a week when I need to change the charcoal filter (once per month)  the sponge filter (every two months) and the biofilter (every three months).  I just know you never want to change more than 1 filter at a time so you don't lose all that good bacteria you built up during your tank cycling.  I'm a little hesitant to change my biofilter but I assume they know what there doing when they tell you all will be OK.  This is a very quiet filter with adjustable speeds - so depending on the fish you can slow that current down.  A betta would be happy.  My fish don't seem to care - I place it in about the middle because right now my fish are very young and probably don't enjoy being tossed around by a current.  This come with two filter tubes - so you don't need to buy any extra unless you have a super tall tank.  I have real plants in my tank and they are determined to clog up my tubes - I have to remove them from the filter tubes every day and wash them out to get rid of plant debris.  Not the filters fault.  I love it actually other than being hesitant to change filters and knowing that it's going to get pretty costly in the long run because the filters are not cheap.  Remember to turn off your filter during a big water change.  You'll also need to re-prime the filter when you re-start it by pouring some aquarium water in the filter. No big deal, no exact amount - you'll know you've got it right when the filter starts working smoothly again.  Overall a great design, just costly to replace the filters.  Too bad you can't just clean some of the filters and reuse - this seems expensive and wasteful.  As far as keeping the water clean - no.  Again, I think this is due to using real plants and some of my fish food (dried worms) come in a cube that disintegrates all over the place.  I don't know if it's a cube of all worms or some kind of binding material but the fish won't eat it so a few days ago I gave them 2 cubes and I'm still fighting the mess of all those strings in the water - and the filter doesn't seem to be helping.  BUT I know as soon as I do a 50% water change - probably in a few days - the water will go back to being crystal clear - so I think this food and plant debris has just overloaded my filter. - it all floats on the top and is a mess to try to suction out or strain out.  I guess I would have expected the filters to pick  up a lot of this gunk - I guess I'll find out when I do a filter change.  I'm hoping I don't see all three filters clogged up since I can't replace all of them at once.  Also they tell you to temporarily remove the charcoal filter if you have to add any medication - or the charcoal will just absorb it all.  I was intimidated by this filter when I first got it (I'm a newbie) but I figured it out in a flash.  UPDATE:6 weeks later:  I really hate this filter.  I refuse to toss out a biofilter and sponge filter that has been growing all my bacteria - when they could be rinsed off and reused.  Also small piece under the filter is supposed to keep this thing level and it falls out CONSTANTLY making the filter unable to get water. I changed the charcoal filter after dumping water on the floor from the filter 3 times so GET YOUR ELECTRICAL out of the way.  This thing is dangerous, hard to use and expensive to maintain. Changing my stars.  A YEAR LATER Amazon tells me I've purched 5 units like that should make me happy (I have 3 aquariums).  The flow rate is awesome - when you have a flow.  My biggest problem is getting the tubing to fit together - on some units it does, on other units it does notl  I've even used a small hammer to pound in the tubing without any luck.  Right now the impeller is not pulling strong enough to suction any water through it;  Took me over an hour to get the tubing to together and it still doesn't work because the impeller is fading away,  I've sent one back for it's lifetime warranty but have since lost the address.  Any sugestions?  EVEN LATER: this is a disaster of engineering I only love it for the three levels of filtration.  But I think what happens is the sponge clogs, water pressure pushes the sponge upwards, which in turn push the carbon and biofilter upward, then it pushes of the lid makes a horrible noise until you take everything out and rinse the sponge out (which is washing good bacteria away) and getting the sponge clean,  After a month or so I put in a new sponge and the same thing happens day 1.  So about 4 out of 7 days a week I fuss with this thing ALL DAY (and I have 4 aqauariums and they all have different sizes and all but the smallest size does this.  Now I set something REALLY HEAVY on the lid to prevent this only to find that since the filter is clogged that no water goes through it.  One day I woke up and the water kept going, overflowed the filer and poured water all over the floor covering about 1/4 of a 9x12 room.  I have no idea how it accomplished that.  The intake tubes are impossible to get in place until you really get the hang of it.  That said, it's lovely to look at, and has 3 levels of filtration.  The cost to replace all our filters isn't in the budget and I haven't seen any I like except external canister filters which are super expensive.",

It's not the fluffiest fur but it is pretty long and can be thick. Every swipe of the brush is full of fur and my dog is never uncomfortable with it (he loves to be brushed now!). The only time he doesn't like it is when there are knots in his fur, but it's not hard to get the knots out with this brush.<br /><br />The best use for it that I've found is getting weed seeds out of my dog's fur. We take him behind our housing development and let him run free, and every time he comes back with burs and houndstongue seeds all over his fur--on/in his ears, his belly, armpits, rear-end. This brush makes it so efficient to get the seeds out! If you know how to brush hair and hold it or press it at the skin so that it doesn't pull or yank (women with long hair know how this goes), it won't hurt your pet to get the seeds out. I've come to the suspicion that my dog now seeks out the weed patches just so that he'll get a good brushing all over after we get home!",

He also has a collapsing trachea.  I tried 3 different harnesses before this one.

I got him a large and it fits great.  He doesn't choke and he holds steady in it.  As with other posters here, I would not leave this on when you are not walking your pet, as the hooks where the leash attach are situated oddly and rattle and hit Tiggie in the back of the head, but this is an amazing solution to all my issues.",

            "question": "title: Three paws down from my four cats\ntext: I wanted my cats to try this grain free salmon cat food.  However, even after mixing it with their own food and a 12-hour standoff, only two of them sampled it and two others were not interested.  One of my cats actually tried to bury the food.  What is really interesting is that I have begun to feed my cats [[ASIN:B000634CO6 Purina One Cat Adult Urinary Tract Formula Cat Food, 16-Pound]] that has a low ash content.  In general, most cats avoid such low ash foods and my cats would not eat any other low ash food but this.  However, when putting down both foods side-by-side, they picked the Purina One.<br /><br />This kibble has a mediocre fishy smell which I do not care for.  However, the aroma slowly dissipates. The package claims it's made of highly digestible protein from fresh salmon; nourishes a radiant and lustrous skin and coat; supports healthy kidney's, immune system and good vision; and has 100% complete nutrition. The first four ingredients are salmon, potatoes, pea protein concentrate, and yellow peas. The guaranteed analysis is:<br /><br />Crude Protein Minimum 29.0%<br />Crude Fat Minimum 18.0%<br />Crude Fiber Maximum 2.0%<br />Moisture Maximum 9.0%<br />Vitamin E Minimum 500 IU/kg<br />Taurine Minimum 0.2%<br />Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) Minimum 85 mg/kg<br />Omega-3 Fatty Acids Minimum 0.5%<br />Omega-6 Fatty Acids Minimum 3.0%<br /><br />Calorie Content (calculated) is 4102 kcal ME/kg; 12 kcal ME/cup<br /><br />This food is obviously very expensive at the current price of $18.56 for a 2 pound bag; however, it appears to be high quality nutrition. Nevertheless, it is no good to me if my cats won't eat it.  I will continue to try to sneak it to them with their regular food.  It appears like my cats do not like Science Diet (see the link to my other Science Diet review in the comments section), as they didn't like [[ASIN:B00DURIQ0G Hills Science Diet Adult Grain Free Cat Food, 11-Pound Bag]] (not salmon flavored) either.<br /><br />March 8, 2014 UPDATE - It's been almost a week that I have been mixing this food in with their regular food.  My one cat still wants to bury it.  The food is being eaten slowly and only as a last resort when not much else is left. This morning I put out the last of the 2 pound bag for the four of them; this time with less of their food and they are avoiding it completely.  However, I know they will eventually eat it when they get hungry enough and after I add in some of their food.  On another note, the package Hill's Science comes in is 5 stars.  I really like the Velcro-like closure which provides for easy access to the food and allows me to seal the bag easily.",

I have an old and sometimes sick cat that keeps throwing up on everything (my bed, his bed, etc.). I used to put down blankets but liquids seeped through. However, with this liner, I can get better protection.<br /><br />I took a picture of this on my king-size bed. There are two liners and they measure 35.5\" x 41\" and not 36\" x 41\" as specified on the Amazon site. So it is 1/2\" shorter. The reverse side is waterproof. I have not washed it yet, so time will tell how well this holds up in the washer. I will update my review if I discover issues.<br /><br />The current price of $31.47 ($33.13 minus 5%) is high but to be expected for this type quality and comes to $15.74 each pad. Not only is this for a dog kennel but it can be used for pets and even as an underlayer for humans underneath a sheet to protect a mattress.

But, unfortunately.. we could not make that happen! I‚Äôm not certain if it‚Äôs to blame on the size/shape/breed of the pug puppy we have? Or.. product itself?<br /><br />Getting this on was NoT the easiest task‚Ä¶ And then, getting the puppy not to try and eat/attack this once we had it in place was even harder!<br /><br />Situation: we have X1 gap ea. week with a 2‚Äô spot in this one day- where the overlap to take puppy out to potty is 2hrs. too long‚Ä¶ Out of a desperate idea- hope that this product would cover gap till our pup could start puppy school (waiting for shots to take effect!!) a a product to keep puppy from an accident and a need to be locked in tiny kennel. The results have been much less then, stellar.. as mentioned, unsure if dog/product is the problem?!!<br /><br />Let‚Äôs be honest- this concept is just not a natural solution and so, not very conducive to success.. it‚Äôs not meant to be in leui of potty training.. I know that..!!! if it all was that easy of a fix, puppies/dogs everywhere would be adorning diapers! I do realize now, this is best used for emergent scenarios ie. plane ride/dr visit/hotel moments- any place with zero access to let them go potty...<br /><br />We did test a total of four times- 3 out 4 tries of putting wrap on and leaving house with him that way- only x1 had the wrap still been in place When coming back!! And- the x1 time this stayed in place on the pup -it did not end well! Upon return.. Not a dry outcome! In fact, it had the bedding puppy was laying on- damp, not soaked but, quite damp. So, the ability to absorb wasn‚Äôt as much as expected? Since, It appeared the puppy kept wrap on and left it alone (it was still ‚Äúin position‚Äú when removing.) we had damp bedding- So, either it filled up or, had leakage..?? I was surprised it leaked- especially with the size of the little puppy- I thought wrap could contain more or guard better?  But, this didn‚Äôt hold up and have dry results- So, is it odd shape of the pug?? Hard to say?! I just know this won‚Äôt meet the particular need with any peace of mind.<br />**note- Yes!! we ceased all food/h20 for puppy and took him out to potty- 30min. after he ate and he went to the bathroom. We curved all drinking h2o to all but eliminated While gone- (we have ability of a drip line) Just for dire thirst/anxiety issues.<br /><br />Overall, it may not help our situation and maybe it is due to an unrealistic expectation.. ?? I do see this having the best benefit on a flight or, a place where NO other option may exist... But, I suggest staying with your dog at all time while using it and also, have backup wraps and bedding in case it doesn‚Äôt hold and you‚Äôre left Up a creek without a paddle‚Ä¶ Or on a plane with a puddle ha ha!<br />Size reference- pug is 16‚Äù girth and 8.7lb.. it is male and he is naughty!!",

            "question": "title: Great box but very fragile\ntext: I ordered 4 of these online at Petco and they are wonderful except for one major issue.<br /><br />First, the litter pans come with a litter scoop, some bags, and a filter. The scoop is really useless so I use metal scoops I purchased separately instead and I don't bother with the litter pan liners at all. The negative of using my own scoop is that since the litter pan bottom has rounded corners, it is a bit difficult to scoop around those corners should some litter be clumped there.<br /><br />Second, what I really like is the swinging door that cats can easily enter and exit and its large design. One of my four cats is fat, a little over 16 pounds, and he fits easily into the box because it is huge.  He also has a problem that he'll pee outside the litter pan if there's no door in the way which is why the door is very important to me.<br /><br />Finally, I have a love / hate relationship with the fact that it is made of hard plastic. The hard plastic makes the box sturdy and also easy to wipe clean with Clorox wipes or a wet paper towel if a cat pees on the sides. The big negative is that the plastic cracks so easily. I knew that before I purchased it but I figured I would handle them with kid gloves and not have too much of a problem with breakage. Well I was wrong.<br /><br />Before I even purchased them online, I looked at them in two Petco's. Each of the Petco's I visited had one of these litter pans (at a much higher price than you can purchase from Petco online) and all those litter pans were broken in one spot or another.  I thought it was just bad customers so I took the risk and purchased online. Of the 4 litter pans shipped, I had to return one because one arrived cracked. They really didn't pack the 4th litter pan right, so this was expected. Petco has an easy return to store policy if you order from their online site, so that wasn't too much of a hassle.  Nevetheless, I continued to love these litter pans for one month until today.<br /><br />Today, I had to clean one fully.  I do this every time I change the litter completely.  Well the litter pan broke in two places. First as I was gentley removing the swinging door the tiny plastic insert that holds it in place in the top broke on one side. Then, I was trying to remove the filter before washing and didn't realize I needed to put the handle down all the way. As a result, when lifting the top off the filter section, that cracked almost in two. That crack was my fault obviously but if it was not such a brittle pan, I would have noticed my error before it cracked. I finally washed the entire litter pan but from now on I will only wipe down the top and wash the bottom part only. This hard plastic is just too fragile.<br /><br />I absolutley loved everything about these litter pans until this point and my cats love them too.  However, I definitely would not purchase them again unless they use a more pliable plastic.<br /><br />My recommendation is to look at it in the Petco store before you order it online. The online price is usually cheaper by $10 to $20 anyway. Also, the online dimensions are listed in centimeters instead of inches so don't think it's small because it really is MEGA.  Decide if you are willing to take the risk of breakage. If you don't clean or move around the litter pan, except take the top off to scoop (which I do twice per day), then perhaps you won't have breakage immediately.<br /><br />The design is 5 stars but the durability is two stars - hence the 3-star ratiing. Had I not had the breakage today I might have still rated this 5 stars.",

            "question": "title: How to Spoil a Cat\ntext: We have two cats that generally sleep apart though occasionally they curl up with one another (unsual as they tend to compete instead of cooperate). They spend the night in the finished part of the basement, and typically one ends up on the couch while the other sleeps on the floor in the hallway. I laid out a blanket for the one who sleeps in the hallway but this is not ideal ‚Äì the blanket gets rumpled and wadded up and she ends up on the floor anyway. I looked to this bed as a solution and it has worked out exceptionally well.<br /><br />This is a plush bed, with four padded inserts for the sides and a soft and extra padded bottom. There is some assembly involved but it's easy ‚Äì the pads insert into the outer shell of the bed and zip in securely. The shell is a suede-like material that should hold up for a good while. When completely assembled the bed is of good size and it takes up a substantial part of the hallway.<br /><br />I laid out the bed and put in a fleece blanket. The blanket is probably unnecessary but I wanted to make sure the cat was doing as little damage to the bed as possible as she loves to sharpen her claws. It took her less than an hour to find the bed and she immediately set up camp. I was a bit surprised to find her and her sister in the bed, and since the first night I have seen them together several times, though usually the one is on the couch anyway.<br /><br />There are two sizes of pet bed here, and I have the Large, not the XL. This pet bed is larger than I would normally suggest for a cat, but it is in a low-traffic area of the house so it is not a problem where it is. It is large enough and substantial enough to comfortably sleep a golden retriever or similarly sized dog.<br /><br />In one fell swoop we have totally spoiled the cat by putting this bed down where she normally sleeps. The bed is comfortable and large enough that both of our cats often sleep next to one another on this bed, which says a lot as they are usually competitors. This is a large, plush pet bed and both of our spoiled rotten cats approve.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

No change in coat conditions\ntext: This is one of those products that probably takes a couple of months to fully evaluate and know for sure if it will truly cut down on the quantity of hair being consistently shed by your dog. Many things contribute to shedding - general health, the diet, the weather, the breed of dog and the type of coat the dog has. For my six dogs it's not terribly difficult to notice a change as a rule. My guys are slick coated and short haired with one exception and 5 of 6 are healthy (1 has an auto immune condition).<br /><br />Ten days with this Shed No More and I have observed the following : Dog #1 will not eat these tablets. He refuses them even when wrapped in actual bacon. He pulls the bacon off and leaves the Shed No More on the floor. Dog #2 can't take these tablets at all because they are loaded with soy lecithin and he is allergic to soy.<br /><br />Dogs #3 & #4 like these tablets and are happy to chew them as treats. Both are short hair Rhodesian Ridgebacks who shed a bit, but not profusely. I haven't noticed any real difference in their coats in the ten days - same amount of loose hair and their coats are no softer than before. Dogs #5 & #6 will eat these tablets only when I mix them up with their food - when offered free hand, they just sniff and walk away. Again, no difference whatsoever in the condition of their coats or quantity of loose hair laying around the house or dog beds.<br /><br />I think the ingredients are probably a good idea in general for helping keep a healthier coat or encouraging a rescue dog's regrowth of healthy hair and skin overall. But to slow excessive shedding in an otherwise healthy dog, go back to the basics of grooming and a super healthy diet, exercise and weight.",

            "question": "title: Tetra Filter\ntext: Setup was easy enough, and the filter's only moving parts are the energy well and the magnetic thing that goes inside. And the hood that pops up, if you count that as a significant moving part. At first, I didn't know how far down to push the carbon filter since the manual didn't specify, so I pushed it all the way down until it couldn't move anymore. Seems to be the right way. It's easy to remove and easy to replace. There's no water flowing over the carbon filter and the black mesh for bacteria cultivation is big enough to not restrict the flow.<br /><br />There's a plastic lip where the filtered water comes out that helps dampen the impact of the water when it flows out, and it works to not stir up the water in my aquarium too much. My water level is pretty high, just touching the lip, so that helps as well. I have a lot of big spiral shells, a hollow castle, and some irregularly-shaped decorations, so the problem others had regarding the suction of the filter doesn't seem to apply to me. My fish are short-finned, active and nervous enough to fight the suction and they can hide easily if they want to. If it ever becomes a problem, I'll just put a piece of black mesh from my old filter into the intake part or wrap it around the openings in the intake piece.<br /><br />Overall, seems like a good deal for 15 bucks or whatever. You can even open up the white filter pouches to replace the carbon without throwing the filter mesh away. And you can reverse the filter mesh if you know what you're doing and make it last that much longer. A decent buy for my 5 gallon aquarium. It makes an audible humming noise if I let the plastic tab on the main filter body make direct contact with the glass, but this is due to the vibrations going through the glass. I placed a small piece of fabric between the glass and the plastic support tab and it makes almost no noise now aside from the faint trickling sound of filtered water coming out and hitting the lip.<br /><br />There are a few flaws, as can be seen above, but nothing serious or deal-breaking, especially for a filter that works as well as something you're likely to get for 30% more (maybe even more than that). I'm satisfied with the performance. If it holds up after a year, I'll definitely buy another one if I need a replacement.",

Small bowls, but work well for smaller heads. Stand seems to stay in place (I have it on a vinyl tablecloth).<br /><br />I had a very specific need for this style of bowl, and it surprisingly met that need. I have two young adult cats that I recently adopted. We already have 2 dogs and a cat and we knew that the transition would be slow. I set the new cats up in my office with all their needs. Door closed so the resident fur balls can sniff through door with new furballs. Then, at some point every day I close off the resident animals in part of the house and let the new kitties roam the other part of the house. This includes a sunroom with a screen door. After roaming around awhile, I close them off in the sunroom (had lots of windows, and totally outfitted with floor to ceiling climbers. Cat dream house!). When I do this, I make sure they have some food and water out there with them. I need the food and water containers to be easy to handle, and preferably something I can grab all at once to empty/clean/refill. That is where this set of elevated bowls come in.<br /><br />The bowls are ceramic but light weight. I needed this. I did not want heavy for my very specific use. The bowls are small but effective-- again, exactly what I needed for my specific use. The framework holds the bowls securely and is easy to grab the whole thing-- perfect for my needs. So.. so far it has met and exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />I use much larger, heavier bowls as the main food bowls any other time-- especially in a multi cat household (prior to adopting these cats, we had recently lost our 2 geriatric babies at 18+ years old.). This would not be something I would use as sole feeding station unless I had one small cat. Basically, know what you need, the size that you need, and the degree of weight you prefer for your bowls.<br /><br />I am pleased with this.",

We needed him to be controlled, but still have the freedom to explore and play.<br /><br />This is really well made and the snap is strong enough to keep our bouncy 60lb Plott Hound connected on a chase in the desert or swimming in a creek out in the wilderness of deep West Texas. The padded handle was definitely a welcome change from the usual Flexi leads. This leash took some serious abuse - it was wet, dragged through the mud, cactus, mesquite tree thorns, boulders, used to tie up a kayak in a pinch, used to tie up a horse when a bridle strap broke, and our big old hound dog tangled it up in all sorts of stuff.

Its made from porcelain ceramic and has no BPA, phalates or harsh chemicals of any kind. Its a great size for our dog Mac-(he's a 15lb bichon frise) it holds up to 1 cup of dog (or cat!) food or water.  Its nice and heavy, so Mac isn't able to easily push it around and cannot flip it over.  Its very easy to clean and doesn't leave any stains from the dog food.  Mac has no issues of any kind eating from his bowl.<br /><br />The detailing is just so great on this!  The 3D Snoopy really makes this an incredibly special item.  Makes a wonderful gift for any pet owner. Truth be told, you don't have to use this as a pet food bowl. Its nice enough that it would make a nice decoration as well, especially for Snoopy fans out there! (I saw another reviewer mentioned they're using their dish to hold keys and that's an excellent idea! Also good to hold some jewelry, or perhaps paperclips on an office desk)<br /><br />Beautiful item, I love it. Mac does too! It comes in a nice box as well!",

Most treats fall short, but one that easily exceeds expectations is Adirondack Grain Free Dog Treats Pure Chicken Breast.<br /><br />Let me start by stating what makes these treats stand out among others: The ingredients. Take a look at the ingredient list and you will see exactly one! Yes, chicken is the only ingredient. There are no preservatives of any kind, no artificial colors, nothing bad at all. Folks, you can‚Äôt get any purer than this. Adirondack dog treats are worth buying and serving to your dog for this reason alone.<br /><br />But, as a reviewer and critic, I must point out one issue I have with this dog treat, and that is the small size. My dogs inhale these small, cube- shaped treats in about 2 seconds. They are far too small for any dog, really. Even small breeds will chomp these down seconds after they are fed. Larger size would be better. And they are so light and lacking substance. The package only weighs 1.8 ounces so you can imagine how light each treat is. They are not chewy and thus take no time to eat.<br /><br />Dog parents like me want what is best for their dog. We know that all dogs love food and love treats, but we know that many treats are not the best quality. Adirondack Grain Free Dog Treats Pure Chicken Breast are the ultimate in quality based on ingredients and other than the inadequate size, there is no good reason not to feed these to your dog.",

            "question": "title: Works As Well As Name Brand Topical Treatments But Costs FAR Less!\ntext: We live in a valley, surrounded by woods and mountains.  Until a few years ago, I didn't think ticks were active during the cold winter months.  I was proven to be very wrong one winter when our dog Mac had a tick engorged on his back in mid December! Lesson learned!  He now receives flea/tick medicine monthly, year round. We've always used a rather expensive name brand flea/tick topical medication on Mac and its always worked VERY well, thankfully! When I received Solimo Flea and Tick Topical Treatment For Dogs, I compared the ingredients to his name brand topical we've been using.  The ingredients are the same but Solimo is FAR cheaper.  Talk about a win-win situation!  I know he's getting medicine that WILL keep the fleas and ticks away and now its costing us less money for the same great protection!<br /><br />Solimo is simple to administer. Simply open the tube and apply it to your dog's dry skin on the back, between shoulder blades.  This needs to be done every 30 days so I make sure to make a note on the calendar immediately following an application so I don't forget the following month. The topical is waterproof.  It has never caused our dog to have ANY kind of negative reaction after we've applied it. (I'm referring to the name brand we used to use as well as Solimo brand) This topical  kills fleas, ticks, larvae for up to 30 days and that includes deer ticks, carrier of Lyme Disease. ( My sister's dog had Lyme Disease and it wasn't pleasant for him.  I certainly don't want my furbaby to go through that so I'm super fussy about making sure Mac gets his meds every 30 days!)<br /><br />I was impressed to see that Solimo (an Amazon brand) stands by this medicine and will refund your money for ANY reason within one year of purchase!  After seeing the ingredients in this topical as well as seeing firsthand how it protects our dog, I doubt I'll never need to inquire about a refund with Solimo Flea and Tick Topical Treatment but its good to know that money back guarantee is in place just in case!<br /><br />Solimo Flea and Tick Topical Treatment will take wonderful care of your furbaby and kill those nasty fleas, ticks and larvae! (Solimo does have a treatment for cats as well!)  I absolutely recommend it!",

However, it does fit two cups of my cats' kibble if I fill it to the tippy top.<br /><br />The stainless steel bowl is so thin and light that I almost feel like I can bend it with my hands. The plastic base is super cheap as well with only rubberized feet in the four corners that prevents some slippage.<br /><br />The bowl can be seated in two positions; either flush with the base or titled at a 15 degree angle. Just insert the base end into the track at the appropriate angle and twist clockwise to lock in place and counter clockwise to remove.<br /><br />The base will move around on the floor with an energetic pet as those rubberized feet do almost nothing to keep this in place.<br /><br />I like the design (bowl tilted in a track), but the execution is SUPER CHEAP. I doubt it costs more than $2 to make this. The current price of $15.99 is outrageous. Yes it is functional, but for that price I expect a larger bowl with more heft and not so thin.

            "question": "title: 3,5 stars, use enough to cover the source of the odor\ntext: \"Try POOPH for 30 days and if you aren‚Äôt happy, simply return it for a 100% no-hassle refund.\"<br /><br />OK, now That's reassuring! I saw one review that said this stuff is a scam. I wish they would have elaborated. I personally think this is worth the try, and I think they may not have used it correctly? who knows. All I can do is share my thoughts. I will explain my situation, and then maybe that will help you decide. But first, I am/was really excited to try this. I had planned on it before the opportunity to try it out came up. I see the commercials on tv (they include it as a video here), and have been curious about the brand. I also like the name, Pooph! My MAIN draw to it is that it is safe for use around animals. Does me no good if the product isnt 100% safe around my sweet babies.<br /><br />My household has 2 large dogs, and 3 cats. We have a 2 story house, and I abide by the \"1 litter box per cat\" guideline of cat ownership (er, being owned by cats--get it right! lol). I go a step further, and have 2 boxes out in my sunroom, 1 box in my office, 1 box in a mid way point of the house, then 2 boxes side by side upstairs in a room with a dog gate with cat door. The combo of different cat personalities and ages, makes me want to make sure that they are all comfortable with where they do their business. This keeps me busy!<br /><br />I use clumping, scoopable cat litter. I find this works best in controlling odor by far over regular clay. I can just grab a dog poop bag and go around sifting litter every day. Not too stinky, but hey-- indoor bathroom creates a little odor, right? No biggie.<br /><br />UNTIL is is 100000 degrees out with full humidity, NO air conditioning, and any left over bits of urine or poops get a strong baked aroma emanating through the house (really just the boxes in the sunroom, omg). I can only clean it out so much, right? But a lot of sprays just mask. Baking soda isnt going to cut it. I really didnt even think this POOPH would help..<br /><br />BUT IT DOES.<br /> BOOM!<br />NOT A SCAM. yeesh<br /><br />This is meant for litter box use, and so I have relegated it just for litter box use. I spray the box, and all around, and I lightly spray the litter too. I was reticent to try that on clumping litter because that kind clumps wetness, right? But, \"POOPH Kitty Litter Deodorizer instantly dismantles odors on contact and can be used on any type of litter\" ie, it is designed not to clump. YAY! No problems using a light sweeping spray.  I noticed IMPROVEMENT. I dont work too hard at it. THOUGH, my first time with it, I initially noticed a burst of worst (worse, but gotta rhyme). It was like it all got more concentrated smelling. But then it went away. Maybe this stuff exorcises the demons from the odor source before disappearing? haha.<br /><br />I feel like I am still in the learning curve of what this product can do. \"As long as Pooph can reach the source of the odor and there‚Äôs as much Pooph as there is stink, Pooph will get it and dismantle the odor\". THAT is what I need to focus on-- spraying the source of the ORGANIC odor, and being sure to use enough.<br /><br />early impression rating of 3.5-4 stars. AS I use is more, and put it through its paces, I will likely come back to update. I am hoping to give their Pet Odor and Stain remover a whirl, and their laundry additive. With a furry household, can use all all the help I can get--safely, of course.<br /><br />I recommend giving it a try--follow directions, read through all the info on the this page.<br /><br />And if you want a sure fire way to see if it works or not, rub a cloth on your stinky dog or cat, and then give it a really good spray down. Something akin to what is shown in the video where he puts a stink on a card and has everyone smell it, then uses Pooph on it, and has them smell it again. OOH, I am going to do that with the litter box, and I will report back my findings. Sometimes a true before and after helps",

But there are some dog treats that outlast others, and I have found a long-lasting option with this, Best Bully Sticks Peanut Butter Stuffed Cow Hooves.<br /><br />Stuffed with dried peanut butter, my dogs took an immediate liking to these chews. They adore peanut butter- what dog doesn‚Äôt?- and they loved eating out the filling. But they didn‚Äôt walk away once the peanut butter was gone. They continued to chew, and chew, and chew. More than an hour later, they were still preoccupied! It‚Äôs rare to find any dog treat with staying power like that.<br /><br />Once the filling is consumed, you can fill the hooves with something else and give it back to your dog for additional enjoyment. I didn‚Äôt really need to, as my dogs took such an immediate liking to these hooves. I‚Äôm not sure if they loved the peanut butter more or the chewing more. Whatever the reason, it kept them busy and happy for a long time.<br /><br />Because these treats are so chewy, they are good for cleaning a dog‚Äôs teeth, since they help scrape away tartar. They are safer than rawhide, too. My only slight issue is that there are only four per pack, but you know what? They are so long lasting, I don‚Äôt mind the limited quantity.

            "question": "title: easy level snuffle mat, just add treats or kibble and present to dog, cat.\ntext: If you have a dog (or cat), then snuffle mats are fun, interesting way to allow a dog to do some nose work. It can be enriching to allow them to sniff through a bunch of material to find some treats or kibble. I make my own snuffle mats using cut up fleece (of various lengths) tied to dish mats or other similarly styled mats. Last one I made was 4 years ago. It was fun to make them, but they take time, effort, money, super sharp scissors, & patience. I didnt exactly need another snuffle mat, but I figured this size and style may be of interest to my cats, so I figured I would try it out. They seem amused by it.<br /><br />The style reminds me of a bath mat. It is the same sort of material, but a little longer material. The material isnt as long and interesting as the snuffle mats I make (or see for sale), but this is a nice option for dogs that havent tried something like this before, or may not want to work too hard, or maybe for tiny dog with tiny kibble. Totally cool for cats too. They can snuffle around for some treats, maybe even use it to sprinkle some cat nip. They'll likely take a nap on it too.<br /><br />For doggos who havent use this before, be sure to use an interesting food item. Tuck it down into the  the material. Also sprinkle some on top so they know what to do. Keep eye on them so they dont start biting, tearing, destroying the material to get to the buried kibble.<br /><br />It's a good size, so really any sized dog can use it. It just needs enough space to sprinkle, hide some treats or kibble. This works fine.<br /><br />There are suction cups; I havent felt compelled to use them.. but I like that they are included.<br /><br />For whatever reason, the material can be taken off as there is a zipper. There is a thin frame of foam tube which I assume would need to come out. Personally, I will be keeping it all together and tossing in wash as is, as needed. As with my other mats, I just wash on cool or cold, and use minimal laundry soap. Could be lightly hand washed, wiped too.<br /><br />As with any toy, puzzle, or other item.. keep eye on your pet, especially if they are the type to want to destroy something. They should be guided into how to use this.<br /><br />4 stars. So far so good..

He LOVES being next to the heating vent. We put a blanket up there for him to lay on.  We turned the heat on in the house a few weeks ago when the weather got cold. Squeaky no longer makes the jump to the top of that cabinet.  He's found a new favorite spot-laying on the bottom shelf of a night table in the bedroom which is right aside of a heating vent.  I was going to place a blanket for him there but instead, I ordered him the Katoggy plush donut bed.  It fits perfectly on the table shelf. For the first week or so, he had no interest in it. (Neither did our dog Mac or our other cat, Miss Piggy) I actually went as far as to ask a neighbor if she wanted the bed for her dog, but she didn't. I was thinking about taking it to the local Animal Rescue League when Squeaky suddenly decided he WAS interested in the bed! lol.  Now, he loves it.  Its a great bed. SO soft , plush and fluffy.  I know he's nice and warm curled up inside of it.  The bottom of the bed has a non-slip surface so the bed doesn't move around on the shelf when he gets in and out of it, it stays in place. The bed is made well. I've not had any issues with tearing , holes or material falling off.  It is machine washable. I've not yet washed it in the machine but I did wash it by hand and allowed it to air dry (it can go in the dryer as well-low heat)  per the instructions so it stays soft and fluffy.  I love this bed and more importantly, so does Squeaky! Makes an excellent gift for pets and pet owners!",

A dog coat is rarely needed at home, but we do travel with a few dogs and run into ugly winter habitats now and then. Our fat Beagle mis gets a pretty thick coat, but she's still a short hair dog and at the ranch in the Chinati Mountains of deep West Texas she gets cold.<br /><br />This coat is really well made and will definitely keep Pudge comfortable in high winds on the trails at the top of the mesas. It covers her chest, the underbelly and has an adjustable collar. The coat attaches with one leg hole and a zipper on both sides of the rib cage. In an emergency, you should be able to remove this without a huge problem.<br /><br />The interior is lined with soft, warm fabric and the top is a thick, water resistant material. Sort of like a puffy jacket that can be removed if it's not cold enough for both layers. The tail piece covers the back hips and base of the tail. There are two zippered pockets that hold poo bags and dog treats or your car keys if you're so inclined. Pudge took offense to being used as a pack mule, so her coat pockets will remain reserved for cookies only.

I buy 1-2 containers per year, then resupply as needed. We were fine during the beginning of the pandemic in 2020, but the issues with products and transport has made an impact in the pet food availability, especially cat food. We've been making due, but it is just a reminder that things can go south real quick, and I want to make sure my babies have provisions. They have plenty of food, but if there comes a time when I have to put together people food scraps for them, I want to make sure they are getting their vitamins and minerals. This does NOT contain taurine, so if you are at all using this in the manner I am, then if you have cats you will want to make sure they have a taurine source. Very important.<br /><br />While I normally wouldn't bother opening this given the reason why I buy it, I have been considering replacing their current vitamin (very very pricy) with something more reasonable. So I opened this up, and sprinkled it on their food. So far so good.<br /><br />BTW, if you are reading reviews, I recommend sorting them by \"most recent\" as it appears that earlier reviews are down rating based on the inclusion of garlic.

We are particular about what goes into his dish and insist the food is made from quality ingredients. Blue Earth‚Äôs Essentials Dry Dog Food passes the quality test, with chicken, lamb, or salmon as the main ingredient, for a good dose of protein.<br /><br />With this dog food, your adult dog can be assured of meeting nutritional needs. The food is comprised of small kibbles also, which is good for smaller breeds. My dog is medium in size and devours the kibbles with no problem. He seems to like the taste, but to encourage him, I will often top this dry dog food with an equally high quality wet food. He doesn‚Äôt seem thrilled with the taste, but he will eventually eat and that is what matters.<br /><br />About the only small issue dog owners may have with this dog food is that the lamb version does include barley. Grain- free dog food is ultimately best, as grains have no useful place in a dog‚Äôs diet. But a little bit of barley should be fine. The added vegetables like sweet potatoes, carrots, and potatoes should also suit your pet‚Äôs body well.<br /><br />Blue Earth‚Äôs Essentials Dry Dog Food is not cheap, and this fact may discourage some people from buying.

We have one cat, a very large feral rescue who wants to be a Maine Coon cat, and my one fear was that she would not adapt to the box and would have accidents all over the house.  (She is definitely a creature of habit.) Well, I needn't have worried: she adapted immediately with no problem at all.  So my main concern was satisfied.<br /><br />Now, as to the box itself.  The plastic is very thin, and the box seems inexpensively made.  You attach the lid on both sides with a latch, which is difficult to attach (but easy to detach).  I simply place the lid on the box in a corner and hope it doesn't fall off.  The swinging door \"catches\" occasionally, but this does not seem to bother the cat, so it doesn't bother me.  The cat simply muscles her way through the door.  I use liners for the box itself, so clean up is easy.  And my major previous problem, litter all over the floor surrounding the box, is greatly diminished (but not completely eliminated).<br /><br />I have no idea how much this cat box costs, but if it is reasonably priced, I can recommend it, if you keep the points above in mind and can live with them.",

These are a nice small size to give as crate treats, but big enough to offer some chewing action.

That means only five of our dogs can eat these. There are only 9 pieces in each bag, so with multiple dogs, these can be a budget breaker.",

They hold enough. I was able to scoop two litter pans for three cats worth of debris and some food debris as well and the bag held both the waste, food, and litter without leaks or holes. These are strong for being biodegradable. However, since they are biodegradable, there's usually a 2-year shelf life for bags like these but there is nothing saying so on the package.<br /><br />These are supposed to be lemon flavored but they smell like oily potato chips when I hold them close to my nose.  The scent is utterly useless.<br /><br />I also dislike the Amazon photo which leads the user to believe they are getting more than one box.

Unfortunately, I find it IMPOSSIBLE to adjust. I was not able to adjust¬†the neck area at all. It took me about 15 minutes to loosen the straps in the waist area. As a result of being unable to adjust the neck, I had to force this on my cat (pictured) but I could tell it was not comfortable because the neck area needed to be looser to match with the waist. In fact, I originally put this on him wrong the first time. I then changed the position so that the D ring faced front, but the fit was no different (see photo).<br /><br />If the adjustments were easy, I would have rated this 5 stars. It has a sturdy D ring in the middle of the chest and a clasp for either side of the waist area. It just slides over the neck and gets fastened around the waist.¬† The handle is supposed to be on top and the D ring is supposed to be in the chest area. A leash can be attached to both the front D ring and the smaller one on the back.<br /><br />As a result of the difficulty with this harness, I cannot use it.

Dog was happy going into the crate as it was covered and also they could not pull it through and chew.

Well the cover did stop it when the dog sprayed in the crate but what me and my friend were most astonished by was that he never tried it again after the pee splashed back off the cover the one time he tried it. Subsequently he has never tried it again! Again a win, win situation.",

Typically it is vomit and that leaves behind a yellow stain on my sand-colored carpet.<br /><br />What I noticed is that if I clean up the vomit immediately and then spray this on the stain, the stain disappears after about two applications. This worked exceptionally well and fast on that stain. However, when I did not realize my cat threw up until about one hour later making the stain about one hour old, then this did not work as well as on the fresh stain. I attached three photos of the results for the one-hour stain. The first one shows the stain without any application. The second photo shows it with one application and the third is with the second application. It lightened the stain but did not eliminate it entirely. Nevertheless, this is as good as other stain removers I tried before, so I cannot expect to eliminate the stain completely if the stain sits.<br /><br />My only complaints are that it is hard to see the lettering on the spout for spray or stream and there is some leakage when dispensing this product. I personally do not like the solution getting all over my hands. Other than this, this is a five-star cleaner, stain remover, and odor eliminator for fresh stains and four-stars for older stains.",

But what if apples and other flavors are added to the ingredient list? It‚Äôs a combination I was willing to test so I went ahead and got my dogs Ollie Chicken and Apple Recipe Jerky Dog Treats.<br /><br />Flat and semi- chewy, these jerky treats are made with chicken and apples, as expected, but they also have other added ingredients, among them oats, celery powder, sea salt, and coconut. These are not necessarily things I wanted to see, but there are no artificial ingredients, and the list is still far shorter than the ingredient list on other dog treats. So far, so good.<br /><br />My dogs love chicken like any dog and they also eat apples on occasion. But would they like them in the same treat? After going through the first package quickly, I can enthusiastically say yes, they do! They love the meaty flavor and other tastes in these treats. They drool and inhale them in a short time, so they easily pass their taste test.<br /><br />Another thing I like about these treats is that they are sold in three packs. This means they are made to last quite a while. There are about eight sticks per bag. I have two dogs and use these sparingly, giving each dog just one jerky treat every few days. That ensures the trio of treat bags will still be around for several weeks.<br /><br />Chicken and apples are not something I thought I would find in a dog treat. But they have turned out to be two things that go together quite well. My dogs love Ollie Chicken and Apple Recipe Jerky Dog Treats and both dogs give them four paws up!.",

That means they eat a lot of hair...theirs, yours, other cats, etc.  All that hair has a hard time passing through without some assistance.  That's where this product comes in.<br /><br />This \"greases\" the digestive tract, giving hair buildup the help it needs to pass on out through the feces.  If hair is not passing through, you'll know it in the form of hairballs or hair tubes left in inconvenient places, because hair does not digest on its own.<br /><br />If your cat throws up a lot, or seems to always want to eat, first check for worms. If s/he is worm-free, suspect hair build-up in their tummies. It takes up the room where food belongs, so when they eat, they can't hold much before it comes back up. They need your help.<br /><br />One of our cats will eat this right from the tube, and would eat it all if we didn't cut him off. The other is unimpressed, so we rub an amount a little bigger than a pencil eraser into his front paws for him to lick off.<br /><br />Catlax truly helps keep hair on the move. We all love it!",

They get treats for good behavior, and they get treats for, well, just because they are our dogs and we like seeing them happy. I try to keep an assortment of treats available at all times and I was more than ready to try these dog treats, from PAWUP.<br /><br />Packaged in a clear canister, these treats are easy to grab from the container, which is easy to reseal thanks to the screw on cap. There are different flavor options and the one I got is the one for puppies. These treats are tied into knots, which I like because it provides dogs with something to grip.<br /><br />With the ingredients, the treats are grain- free which is good. The other ingredients are a little different from that of other dog treats. The puppy chews contain cranberries, chia seeds, and other non- traditional ingredients. Some of the flavor options have chicken, so if your dog is a meat lover, you might want to stick with those. The puppy chews also have added taurine, which is good for a dog‚Äôs brain development.<br /><br />The treats I got don‚Äôt have meat, but my two dogs love them regardless. Their mouths water and their tails wag when they get these treats. They have a good deal of quality and I like the easy- to- seal canister. Overall, these are good dog treats, and they are recommended to anyone who likes to pamper their pet while maintaining good health.",

            "question": "title: Better than Drinkwell...cheaper too!\ntext: Definitely seems like a superior design to the Drinkwell fountain I used to have.  I've only had it running for a couple weeks, so I can't speak to the longevity.  However, I think having a fountain where the dogs drink at the TOP of where the water is pumped is FAR superior to one where they drink at the BOTTOM after the water has flowed down, as in the Drinkwell design.<br /><br />The main advantages of this design are that the dogs aren't drinking water from where there is likely debris in it, and that this design is much easier to clean.  Dogs are messy animals.  No matter how much you try to keep the area around the water bowl clean, it seems like they would get nasty bits of who knows what in the drinkwell fountain, and they'd be drinking from the same area!  Yes, I know that dogs don't have the same 'ick' factor we humans do, and that most of the particles that ended up in the 'pool' at the bottom were likely benign.  But you'd have to be ultra vigilant, deep cleaning that fountain probably every other day to have it looking like truly clean water that your dogs are drinking.  With this design, which I didn't even know existed until recently, any particles, backwash, whatever you want to call it that was ending up in the fountain, will at least flow to the bottom where the dogs aren't drinking directly from it.<br /><br />They seem just as happy to drink from this fountain as they did the drinkwell.  There are much fewer crevices which makes it a snap to clean.  As an added benefit, it seems like they end up splashing less water on the floor with this one, too!<br /><br />I have read some reviews claiming that the pump tends to die a premature death on this one...I can't speak to that yet.  If that's the case, I still will stand by my opinion at least the design is far superior even if the quality of the materials may not be....I would probably just see if I can locate a higher quality, third party pump if this one burns out before it should.

UPDATE: these are out of stock everywhere so it's only individuals that happened to have kept a box or two that are selling them at such ridiculous prices.  I contacted Hartz and they blamed it on the inability to move product ingredients due to COVID, but assured me they would be back in production as soon as possible so there is no plan to discontinue this product.  It's sad for those of us with cats that love this A LOT or, for medical reasons enjoy this as a good treat.  It's also a great way to bond with your cats so when they come back in buy the chicken kind (most popular) and spend just a few minutes each day bonding with your cat.  Mine only gets one per day.

The noise is not constant. It it more likely to make noise when it hits certain spots. I like this, is not as obnoxious as it could be. No matter, the sound is super silly, I have heard it before in other toys. I may post a video, but their product video does a good job demonstrating the sound.<br /><br />My two labs are mildly interested in this. It depends on if Mommy plays too. Then it is suddenly a favorite of my boy. We have had a lot of fun playing with it inside. I toss it, he chases. My girl then chases him, chasing the ball. He brings it back to me. I toss it again. Sometimes I add in some \"hide and seek\". So while he fetches the ball, I \"hide\". Makes my girl crazy playing this game. So she semi chases him, then turns around and quickly finds me, then he comes back with ball, finds both of us. Huge party reunion, then repeat. All the while the ball is occasionally making its super silly sound. Silly toy, silly labs. All of it makes me laugh. Great times :)<br /><br />But for them to play with it on their own? Likely not. But who knows.. they have 1000 toys, and there are but a few favorites, then all the rest make an occasional appearance. Not sure where this will fit in yet. Definitely is a more interactive toy for all of us, rather than just one or the two. But it works, it is durable, it is fun for us.<br /><br />Be sure to check the sizing and compare it to what your dog can handle, or prefer. It is a tad larger than what my labs are used to playing with. This is 5.5\" wide, 17\" in circumference. Hard plastic. We use it inside. I roll it rather than throw it because it is hard. My boy with his huge block head can pick this up, my smaller girl hasn't tried.  Likely best for doggos who like to kick or nose balls around. While my boy can play fetch style game with this, I wouldn't think it would be the best choice for that style of play since there is no give to the material and overall it is large for a mouth. You know your dog best, and so it could work for you. It kinda does for us.  Since my two babes like to \"fight\" over a toy, and this one is hard to engage that game.<br /><br />I give it 5 stars because the ball is solid and seems quite durable. Nothing wrong with it, really comes down to play style and toy preference of your dog. We have had some fun times with it, so I am glad it works for us.<br /><br />I don't have kids, but it made me think that this would be a perfectly fun toys for kids to play with. It is rather entertaining :)",

While I use poop bags out on walks with my dogs, I  also use poop bags for cleaning out the multiple cat litter boxes. We use scoopable litter, so I go around and clean out the boxes every day. I was using the plastic bags we got from grocery stores, but now that the stores dont use those any longer, I buy small bags to use. I  find that the biodegradable poop bags are perfect for my needs. I can fill up the bag with heavy litter encrusted poop & pee balls, and these hold up.<br /><br />These are just a wide tube bag, no handles. Good size for putting hand in to grab poop off the ground, and still be able to tie a knot. Larger than some I have had.  I think it comes down to your preference.<br /><br />I have not had any break as of yet, save for the initial bag off the roll. I tend to find the first bag--because of the sticker-- creates a weak spot. So, true to my experience with all brands, the first bag easily ripped where the sticker was. Next bag on roll, when pulled in all directions, did not rip. I could see the material stretch, but it did not rip (and I was trying).  And for that, I think these are pretty good. If I experience anything else-- like more tearing, I will be back to update & revise.<br /><br />The poop bag roll holder is pretty durable feeling. It comes with a small D-ring clip attached to it.

            "question": "title: Long Lasting Treats\ntext: My dogs are spoiled when it comes to treats. They consume treats of one type or another every day and I like to mix up the quick serve treats with the longer lasting treats. A good example of the latter is these pig ear dog chews from Bullysticks and More.<br /><br />These pig ears are single ingredient, so they earn high marks for purity. They don‚Äôt smell as bad as other dog treats, either. They are certainly not something you will want to smell but compared to some of the dog treats on the market, these are inoffensive.<br /><br />The best feature of these pig ears is that they take time to chew. They are large in size- large enough to keep medium and smaller size dogs busy for a while. A larger, more aggressive chewer will be able to eliminate one of these chews in a matter of minutes. But that is still longer than other dog treats last. And if your dog isn‚Äôt as aggressive and likes to take his/her time with chews, then you can expect these to last a while.<br /><br />My dogs love their treats and they adore pig ears. These pig ear treats might gross some people out, but remember that it is your dog that is eating them, not you. They are natural, long- lasting, and you get a large number per package. They make a good choice for anyone who wants a dog treat that cannot be consumed in a few seconds.",

I see many other cat collars, especially &#34;hand-crafted&#34; ones, that use the same<br />black clips that are used for small dog collars.  These are great for small dogs, which are much stronger than cats.<br />They are NOT safe for cats, because it would take amazing strength and pull to break one loose if a cat was caught.<br />They could easily fall victim to predators if they were ever caught outside on a bush or hedge. (Yes, people will<br />disagree with me on that, but I stand firm. I've tested them with my own hand strength, and know for a fact most cats<br />could not break the black rectangle/square clips.)<br /><br />Safe Cat collars always use the round safety clips, which are made specifically for cats.<br />If you must let your cat go outdoors (not safe in the city), these are the ones you want.<br />We have two indoor cats, and still use these, in case they would ever slip out the door.<br />They have already &#34;popped&#34; the collars off inside the home, and we still have not found where they are getting hung up...<br />we think it might be somewhere behind the dryer. But imagine the horror if we pulled out the dryer and found our cat<br />had hung himself and couldn't break the collar!!  *shudder*<br /><br />We are happy with our purchase, and have ordered a couple extra collars.

You don't want to use too much or too little glue.  Too much will stick to the fur or the skin that hold the retracted claw.  Too little will be ripped off when climbing.  Both scenarios may cause discomfort.  If you've ever had fake nails, you know that ripping one off leaves a sensitive nail surface behind.  Regardless this is far better than mutilating a cat by declawing.  Trick is to get them on and knowing the right size and right amount of glue.  Have a vet tech help if you have doubts.

I tried these over the last few nights and I have been surprised at how well they work.<br /><br />There hasn't been any leakage through to her bed and these are certainly easier to clean up. Just toss the used pad in the trash and no doing laundry first thing in the morning. I won't use these permanently simply because they create extra waste and aren't terribly inexpensive, but now and then these are a good back up option.",

            "question": "title: Thought It Was Silly At First...But Its Perfect For Our Dog!\ntext: I admit to doing a double take when I first saw this...a power bar for dogs? Then I thought about it for a bit and the more I thought about it, the more I liked the idea.  Our bichon Mac enjoys treats, goes for walks, loves to visit /stay with his grandparents (my parents) when we go away. All are perfect occasions for Mac to enjoy a PLATO energy bar.<br /><br />Mac's favorite food is salmon. He LOVES it, so I was thrilled when I saw the salmon + carrot bar and that is what I ordered him.  Salmon is the #1 ingredient and that is important to me.  I want Mac to eat healthy.  The remaining ingredients are limited and healthy as well.  The bars are packaged well (and individually wrapped), nice and fresh.  They're a good size and soft-ish....soft enough to easily break pieces off and Mac has no trouble chewing the pieces.  I didn't think he liked it at first. I broke a piece off and gave it to him and he spit it out.  Then he spent a minute or two nudging it around the floor with his nose. lolol.  He gave it another try, picked it up, chewed it and LOVED it.  Immediately stared me down for another piece!<br /><br />This is not a complaint but I thought I'd mention it. The scent of the energy bar isn't pleasant.  Wash your hands well after touching it.<br /><br />Since I don't give him an entire bar at one time, I wrap  some foil around the end (while keeping it in its original wrapper) and store it in a zipper sealed sandwich bag.  Its been days since I first opened the bar and its still nice and fresh.  These are perfect for 'on the go', traveling, a snack/reward, for an extra burst of energy. Seeing as salmon is the #1 ingredient, the bar contains minimal but healthy ingredients, they're convenient and Mac loves them, I find the price to be reasonable. I love to spoil my furbaby and I'm SO glad I can give him a healthy treat that he LOVES!",

The &#34;meat&#34; part is just too homogenous and artificial looking for my taste.  More importantly, my dog did not seem very thrilled at all with the gelatinous gravy. The price is VERY reasonable.  If you or your dog are not very picky about food and economy is your main concern, this might be a good food to mix with your dog's dry food. For me and my dog, it just wasn't right. Since then I've decided to make my own mix-in...when I go to the grocery store once a week I look and see what protein sources are on sale - chicken, turkey, liver, ground beef, canned salmon and then buy a pound or two of it. I keep a big bag of frozen peas in the freezer and I always have a couple of carrots in the veggie bin. On the weekend, I saute or boil the protein source, add in a few handfuls of peas and grate in one or two carrots and then I may even break an egg or two and let them cook into the mixture.  Any leftover rice or pasta that we have in the fridge gets thrown in.  When I feed my dog, I scoop out a cup of this mixture, pour some chicken or beef stock (maybe 1/4 cup) over it and microwave it for 30 seconds.  Then mix it in with his dry food.

I had already been a few weeks or so in with adding in extra  vegetables, fruits, turkey tail mushroom supplement and another similar sort to her food.  Then I wanted to incorporate something for times when she was not up for her regular bowl of kibble and whole foods. Sometimes all she wanted was pate. However, by time this arrived, I noticed that we were getting close to the end (we scheduled Lap of Love for a few days later). So I never opened this. I would have given this to her as I didnt see anything it it that concerned me, I just wanted to make sure she was getting a well supported diet. I was cleaning out her food and supplement area, and stumbled upon this having totally forgotten about it. I wont be using it on our other dog or cats. I know the cats wont eat it, and I doubt my ultra picky lab will, and the price for upkeep is astronomical for a 100 lb dog.<br /><br />This is the part that they could do better with in terms of info transparency. Either include it on the bag or include it on the product page. I don't know how many servings are in a bag! \"Can last up to 1 month for dogs or 4 months for cats---depending on daily dosage\". Ok cool.. but which amount is this referring to? Also, they give nutrient info as \"per 3 grams\", and the bag in in grams (100 grams) but the serving is only in teaspoon. Now all dry ingredients weigh the same when packed into a \"rounded teaspoon\". So a teasppon can be anywhere from 3 grams to 8 grams depending on what it being scooped up.<br /><br />So lets do some assumptions then.  I assume they are referring to the small end of the size spectrum for how long this will last (Thirty, 1/4 tsp servings). SO if that is for \"up to\" 30 days at that amount, then the 2 tsp for large dogs (over 51 lbs) will last a week, and that is just based on if 1/4 tsp = 30 days, then 2 tsp (4 half tsp) will be 7.5 days. Nevermind the actual weight, etc, which could be closer to 10 days, but why do I need to buy this and use it up to figure it out? Just tell us!  That's around 152.00 (plus tax) for a month supply for a dog over 50 lbs. Save a little w/ subscribe and save. For short term use.. I'll pay anything, but this is a bit much for a regular use. I dont rate on price, by the way. I figure we all can see the price and decide before purchase. We all have different needs, budgets, and situations. I was open to this for short term use, but as I stand now I have a totally unopened bag that I wont be using. Might call around to see if I can donate it.<br /><br />Iodine information is on back of packet as well as can be seen in their product picture (sixth photo over, or second to last, lower right corner). The iodine is naturally occurring from Dulse, algae and kelp. As someone who has had hypothyroidism/hashimotos since childhood, I am well aware that iodine containing food is not good for the thyroid at all. I can eat foods containing it, but not on a regular basis, and certainly not as a supplement. Same holds true for animals. So be aware if you have pet with this condition. Even though it is listed as a caution on the package, I would like to see it listed more clearly on the product page.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Spirulina and Chlorella Blue-Green Algae; Free-Range, Grass-fed Beef Liver; Barley Grass, Wheat Grass, Organic Wheat Grass Juice Powder; Lecithin; Alfalfa Juice Concentrate; Fructooligosaccharides (FOS); Brown Rice Protein; Dulse and Bladderwrack; Air-dried Parsley; Blueberry; Flaxseed; Beet Root; Natural Bacon Flavor; Carrot; Air-dried Broccoli; Air-dried Spinach; Turmeric; Beta-1-3-D Glucan; Amino Acids (L-Arginine, L-Histidine, L-Isoleucine, L-Leucine, L-Lysine, L-Methionine, L-Tryptophan and L-Valine); Probiotics (Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, B. bifidum, L. rhamnosus); Vitamin D3; Digestive Enzymes (Lipase, Invertase, Protease, Amylase, Cellulase); Cayenne fruit.",

But I know she is not really clean and hours later I can still smell the beachy dog and end up giving her a bath. With these grooming wipes in hand, I run it over her after she has been rinsed and towel dried and I noticed an immediate improvement. The scent is lovely and it seems to stay with her. Although I will probably regularly have to wash her anyway, these wipes, in a pinch do the job to keep her fresh smelling. I keep them in my glove compartment.

Sophie really liked this food as can be seen from the photo. However, Sadie would not eat it.<br /><br />Note that unless a dog has a grain allergy, it is not a good idea to feed them grain-free foods exclusively. The reason is that vets are finding an association between heart disease (such as canine dilated cardiomyopathy) and grain-free dog foods. However, it is mostly associated with the foods that have peas, lentils, other legumes or potatoes as their main ingredients. Note that I did not see any of the \"bad\" ingredients in this food; however, I personally would only supplement a dog's diet with grain-free since the science is new even though I really like the ingredients in this food.<br /><br />This food's first ingredients are deboned turkey, egg, sweet potato, tapioca, turkey fat, natural turkey flavor, flaxseed, minerals, calcium carbonate, etc.<br /><br />The current price of $19.99 for 4 pounds is competitive for this type of food.<br /><br />PS Amazon is rotating all pictures for the last several months.

I live in a 1 bedroom apartment and the only places to put our multi-cat jumbo litterbox is in the living room or the bedroom. Essentially, while we're enjoying a quiet cuddle night and TV dining, our cats are pooping six feet away from us in our line of sight. It's not a very good arrangement.<br /><br />I finally talked about the benefits of having a litter cabinet with my partner and we agreed to just do it.  I will never regret having bought this item. First, we decided to use it as our TV console and it supports our 40 pound flat screen TV with ease (we put it towards the back because we did not install the center divider when assembling, so there was a bit of middle support missing which we were concerned about). The assembly wasn't the easiest, but it came together just fine. I would suggest it as a two person job, if possible, so one person can hold the heavy compressed boards for the other.<br /><br />As I said above, we veto'd the central divider due to the size of our litterbox and have about 5\" clearance between the entry and the edge of the box. I had also bought some corrugated cardboard kitty scratchy pad inserts off Amazon and broke off a portion to stick between the box edge and the entry/exit so help with further getting residual granules off their paws in exit, or if they try to cover their misdeeds by scratching on interior walls or floor, there's a scratchable surface for them, too.<br /><br />We were concerned about the darkness in there at night and bought some battery charged stick-on motion detector lights off Amazon when we ordered this litter cabinet, and they work perfectly if centered on the entryway. Our cats have gotten used to the light coming on and they actually seem to appreciate the privacy while they powder their noses now. It is working out for us fantastically and we're just grateful to have found this affordable model. It really does just look like a TV console if you didn't know any better, so it fits in our room perfectly.",

BUT for a more thorough clean, and to reach some areas, a brush may be better.<br /><br />I want to try this on my cat, but there is no way any of them will let me stick my finger in. Although big, I think this would be easier to use for a quick brushing.",

(And i definitely snapped all the pieces in all the way, and assembled it correctly.)  Neither large dog would climb the stairs that I ordered with it, so that leaves trying to lift an 80-lb dog into this bath.  I gave up.  Next I tried it with my 30-lb older dog.  He didn't like it, but I did manage to bathe him and finish up.  Last, I tried it with the husky-mix puppy, also about 25-30 lbs and about 4 months old.  She hated it and started bucking like a bronco once I clipped her collar to the restraint.  The restraint doesn't really hold her in place - for that, you'd need another for the hind end!  She actually managed to twist around and jump over the side, and would have strangled herself if I hadn't grabbed her immediately.  Obviously, never leave your dog unattended if clipped to that collar attachment.  Bottom line:  my dogs do not like to be washed, and this doesn't make it any better or easier to do so.  If you have dogs that enjoy being washed or are very well behaved, then it might be ok.  Also, I do not think it is really sturdy enough for 75+ pound dogs, I would only recommend for smaller to medium dogs.  And I personally found it hard to assemble and the directions were TERRIBLE.",

It‚Äôs easy to go for the least expensive option when shopping for dog food, but these cheaper foods are not good for dogs. A better option is a dog food like Nature‚Äôs Variety Instinct Raw Boost.<br /><br />As you can see from the ingredients and other facts, this is a high quality dog food and just to make sure it wasn‚Äôt a bunch of hype, I went to the internet and looked through the web sites that rate dog food. I quickly got the confirmation I wanted: Nature‚Äôs Variety Instinct Raw Boost is, indeed, better than the average dog food. It is high in protein, free of unhealthy fillers, and loaded with omega 3 and omega 6 for a dog‚Äôs good health.<br /><br />One other important quality of any dog food is, of course, the taste factor. My young dog did find this dog food good overall and he took to it in a short time. No, he didn‚Äôt go all- out crazy over the food and gulp it down, but these higher quality dog foods often take time for a dog to accept. The cheaper foods are made to taste good- much like candy tastes good to a child. Better dog foods take some time to win a dog over and Nature‚Äôs Variety Instinct Raw Boost did take some time, but it was worth the wait.<br /><br />The one drawback to this dog food is the price. It is quite costly- more than other high end dog foods and multiple times more expensive than the low quality dog foods. If you‚Äôre going to buy this, I recommend splurging and buying the larger bag, since it significantly cuts the per pound price down to size.<br /><br />Dogs deserve only the best and Nature‚Äôs variety Instinct Raw Boost is one of the better dog foods on the market. It is expensive, yes, but isn‚Äôt your dog worth it? Spend a little now, and improve your dog‚Äôs overall health with Nature‚Äôs Variety.",

This Chicken and Brown Rice kibble is one of the two dry foods. I have had three of my five dogs on it for a couple of months now with excellent results.<br /><br />Each 30lb bag smells fresh when opened and there's no oily or greasy residue on the food pieces if you roll it through your bare hands. The pieces are small and crunchy and mix well with water and a little canned food if you want. My guys love it and will eat single pieces as training rewards.<br /><br />In two months I have noticed a significant increase in energy levels in one of my dogs in particular (she is 9 and was energetic before, but she's acting like a three year old again) and a definite improvement in the joy level at dinner time in all three that are eating the chicken formula. None have experienced any digestive problems and we aren't noticing any flatulence whatsoever. I'm using the subscribe and save option and that's been a good deal for convenience and value. I'm really glad we made the switch to the Avoderm products.",

The bungee end is something I really like on all our regular leashes. It gives the dog a hint they are at the end without snatching them back hard.<br /><br />This particular leash is best suited for a taller dog simply because it's only six feet in total - our smaller rat terrier mix actually had a difficult time with this compared to our very tall Plott Hound who just strolled along happily.  Additionally, don't use this with a dog who isn't fully trained or you risk getting dragged.<br /><br />Traveler understands heel, wait, slow, walk on, and stop for walking in public. He seemed to enjoy this leash today and by having verbal command over his speed, I felt comfortable using it hands free. I don't think the reflective stitching is right on mine however.

Real shredded chicken that the dogs like\ntext: Limited ingredient diets are a good idea if your dog has food allergies and a couple of mine do with regard to wheat and soy. I tried the Chicken and Sweet Potato version of these pods for my pack with mixed results to my surprise. One of my dogs has had diarrhea for the three days we've been adding these to their regular food. Every one else is fine though. I took one of the pods to our vet and we think the sweet potatoes are just not agreeing with Traveler - there isn't anything else that jumps out at us as particularly problematic.<br /><br />My one star deduction is not because of the digestive issues for our one dog out of five, but for the poor value these represent in general. These pods are only 2.75 ounces each - less food than almost every other similar sized single serve small &quot;canned&quot; dog food option on the market. Furthermore, these are significantly more expensive per pod than the other versions on the market - even the other super premium, limited ingredient brands. In comparison.... the Wellness Core pods are larger, similarly priced, made in Thailand just like these are, smell better, and have no corn, wheat or soy and you get more food per serving.

Those 3 live for car rides, so it just took a single try to them on the steps and into the Sequoia. We've tried these steps with a Sequoia, a Kia Soul and a F-150 truck.

This canine multivitamin is packed with SO many vitamins, anti-oxidants, probiotics, and many more that come together to keep dogs healthy and happy.  Itchy, dry skin becomes a thing of the past. The dog's heart remains strong. It regulates the dog's digestive system and helps to prevent vomiting, diarrhea and stomach pain. Arthritis and joint pain is reduced giving the dog more mobility.  Just ONE vitamin daily does all of those wonderful things and keeps the dog happy and healthy.  There are no bizarre, worrisome ingredients -all ingredients are 100% all natural. And, they're made here in the USA! I 'm so happy, knowing these vitamins are helping to keep my Mackie Bear (lol...sorry...I have nicknames for him) happy and healthy.  He likes the taste of this vitamin and though I only just started to give him one daily, he already comes running when i open the cabinet the bottle is in because he knows he's going to get a treat! For all of the benefits this vitamin delivers, the price is incredibly reasonable!  I did contact Mac's vet prior to starting the vitamins just to be safe and she was perfectly fine with it. A HUGE' thank you' to GOOGIPET for creating this tasty vitamin that will help my boy Mac stay healthy and happy!  Dog owners, I definitely recommend GOOGPET vitamins for your furbabies!",

I typically feed a true, grain free super premium dry kibble mixed with a super premium canned food that has ingredients I can fully understand and recognize. The canned Pedigree is sort of a middle of the road compromise with regard to quality level of ingredients - I think of it like fast food burgers vs home cooked from scratch healthy eating. Nothing really wrong with a McBurger and fries now and then, but you don't need a steady, daily diet of it - neither do my dogs.<br /><br />All that being said, I don't mind this stuff now and then mixed up with the very expensive regular canned food we regularly feed. My dogs like the slight variation in taste and mixing the two doesn't cause any digestive distress or flatulence. I definitely prefer the Pedigree ingredients to the overhyped Science Diet nonsense - there's no corn, no soy or wood fiber cellulose added to the Pedigree unlike the Science Diet. Pedigree has chicken and meat byproducts and something called &#34;cheeseburger flavor&#34; - no clue what that might actually be. It's soy and corn free and that's a good thing indeed.",

I suspect anyone with an active or large dog is going to lose the feet rather quickly. A quality I like is there's no stuffing in the toy. Even in the event your pet does (and some can!) chew through the edge binding or body there's no mess to be scattered about the house like you get with stuffed toys. On the blue footed bird (I'm sure the Amazon censor-bot will dislike it's actual name) the beak, eyes and facial feathers are all painted on (I can find no information on what type is used even on the Outward Hound page) I suspect they'll go next and would expect it's non-toxic. But contact the company if you've any concerns. There are three squeakers in the lower body, neck and head. These are supposed to continue squeaking even if punctured. Each makes a distinctive sound. I found the one in the neck rather hard to squeak by hand but the other two just need the slightest squeeze.<br />All in all this is a fairly durable pet toy that should last a good while for some dogs.

This was the first time we had to leave her completely alone and we had some concerns about making sure she had enough kibble during the day. I selected this feeder with that thought in mind. We ended up not using it during the time we were gone as it came too close to the time we had to leave (no time to learn how to use it) and we had someone reliable come to feed her anyway, but we have since worked with it and are pleased with it.<br /><br />The idea behind this feeder is straightforward. It dispenses food automatically, portioned and timed as needed. There‚Äôs no real mystery there. However, this is more than a simple ‚Äúdumb‚Äù feeder that spits out a cup of food every so often and has one setting. Multiple feedings can be set up and portion sizes are adjustable to make getting the amount right without a lot of guesswork. Everything is programmable so that odd times can be set up instead of setting the feeder to go off at fixed intervals or at specific times of day.<br /><br />In use it works well. We can set it to feed our girl twice a day (it‚Äôs capable of more) which is plenty. She‚Äôd eat as much as we‚Äôd feed her if we gave her more, and weight control is an issue with her, so controlling the portion side is important for us.<br /><br />Assembly doesn‚Äôt require much effort and in no time at all we had it ready to roll. The instructions are fairly easy to understand too, though the controls are straightforward.<br /><br />This is a good automatic feeder and it will serve well when scheduled feedings are necessary without having to be around.

It's also made scooping the yard much faster.

Started searching, and that just brought me down a dog bed rabbit hole, haha. So many options.! The look of this intrigued me. I liked that this would fit on their bed, would be light weight yet appeared lofty enough to provide comfort. I didnt plan on it to be used anywhere else. I saw similar products, and kind of looked through those reviews to see if I'd like this one. The price was better on this and had the color I preferred, and the description was all in line with what I wanted, so I went for it.<br /><br />It arrives rolled up. It is just kept closed via a trip of velcro. The ribbing you see are puffy panels, and lends to it being able to be rolled up. There is a flat handle on one side, which does not impede use of that side. Two tone brown, just what I wanted. The darker side is meant for use against ground, with lighter side being what they lay on. Says it is waterproof. I imagine it can handle some wetness so long as it isnt sitting in a puddle (or allowed to have liquid accumulate). The pad is on thin side, but it has loft. It reminds me of a camping bed pad, just a little more fluffy. If you travel, this is something I would recommend as it rolls up nicely and cleans up easily.<br /><br />I didn't know if they'd like it. Once in hand, I was like.. mmm maybe they wont like the texture of the panels. But, I placed it on their bed, and let them tell me if they like it. It ultimately came down to my dogs as to whether this is any good. I have two large yellow labs. They IMMEDIATELY took to it, and it even piqued the interest of my cat.<br /><br />The 40\" x 26\" is the minimum I would go for a dog of their size. My girl fits better on this- she's around 70-75 lbs and is more compact, whereas my boy is a big moose (105 lbs), so he hangs off of it a bit. But that doesnt stop him from lounging on it. In fact, I notice that they like to pick it up and take it somewhere so they can both kind of lay on it. They are very much bonded, so they are always together. I will see them just laying down shoulder to shoulder, and a couple of times they used this together. I will try to get a pic, so cute.<br /><br />The unexpected benefit of the panels, is that my girl-- who is a snuggler-- can pull a panel or two toward her and make it scrunch like a pillow. So cute.<br /><br />I didn't plan to use this outside, but now that I have it, I will give it a try. Come nicer weather when we are all hanging out outside, I may grab this for them to lay on. Seems like it will be very easy to clean off. I can't test that right now or any time soon. It is still winter in NY- we just had snow, and now it is melting so there is lots of wetness and mud. My dogs aren't lounging outside in this weather even if this bed can hold up to it. But inside? yep they are using it (esp my girl, and my cat). I may get another so each dog has one.<br /><br />Anyway, glad I bought this. So far so good, and I recommend it.",

            "question": "title: So quirky it becomes cute.. the kitty loves!\ntext: Who knew.. The center of attention would be a gawky looking giraffe set in the living room- a giraffe made to disguise a cat scratch post?! No one visits without chatting about this silly but clever little thing! Certainly a novelty way to decorate and hide cat paraphernalia!!<br /><br />Im pretty sure kitty thinks it‚Äôs a lost relative.. she seems so intrigued by its head- dare I say she can even be a bit shy and timid around it.. a budding romance?!! Either way, within a minute she is digging her claws into the post as intended and sparing our furniture- Some do wonder how cat ‚Äúknows to use it‚Ä¶‚Äù well, happy to say- all without help she figured it all on her own. Go figure- crazy cat instincts!<br /><br />Easy to build this is beyond simple. Set includes instructions but, optional and not necessary. Received folded at base hinge with x3+ pieces. This includes a ‚Äúhex key‚Äù which is ONLY tool you‚Äôll need! Posts have screws in place. Unfolded one inserts post then.. using key just tighten at the base. Boom! It‚Äôs that easy- the spring tail with bell + rope post are sturdy and bolted in. But, both the eye + nose are hot glued on.. and done a bit sloppy. Total truth, these may not last long! *Be sure they won‚Äôt cause choking hazard if dislodged- my x1 concern or complaint and reason to deduct x1 star. All other features ie. feet, ears are stitched into place and seem to entertain kitty.. ours is quite obsessed with the head/face!<br /><br />Overall, this is a ‚Äúso ugly.. it‚Äôs cute‚Äú type of item. One that‚Äôs well worth $16- a solid deal for a scratch post alone.. to be quirky cute is a bonus- extra pay pieces are icing on the cake! Hoping this info helps your decision- stay safe everyone.",

I am wary of feeding excess soft food, but I don‚Äôt mind adding soft food or other toppers to their dry food. This preference is the reason I was happy to discover Zesty Paws Allergy Immune Bone Broth for Dogs.<br /><br />Packaged in a pump bottle, this broth is easy to add to your dog‚Äôs food. Just hold the bottle upright and pump it a few times to coat the food. It doesn‚Äôt take much and the scent and flavor are enough to convince the most finicky canine consumers to give in and start eating.<br /><br />This dog food product is more than just a flavor booster, however. It is also formulated to improve your dog‚Äôs overall health, with omega 3 and other ingredients to improve your dog‚Äôs coat, skin, and digestion. I can‚Äôt really comment on these qualities- I will have to take their word for it. All I know is that it does persuade my dogs to eat and if it does, indeed, help in these other areas, then that makes it even better.<br /><br />Zesty Paws makes life better for your dog and it is much easier to use than soft dog food, which must be scooped out of a can with the remainder stored in the fridge. I had a slight issue with the pump at first, and it did make somewhat of a mess. But I worked out this minor issue and have had no problems since.

However, we made adjustments to it and after two months, it's still in daily use.<br /><br />The problem is the throat latch strap. That is both a blessing and a dangerous addition. Without all three attachments, the mask doesn't work and won't stay on - velcro under the jaw, ear strap and throat latch strap. Unfortunately, the design for the throat latch is bad. The hanging end after it's fitted, dangles loose and can be tightened by any little pull or catching on a fence post etc. If your horse has a buddy....like, say, a donkey who messes with stuff, this strap can be pulled dangerously tight around the throat.<br /><br />We ended up setting the length and tying it off in two knots below the snap closure. So far this has stopped the entire strap from being tightened by the donkey and the mask stays on until I remove it.<br /><br />The actual face/eye covering works very well and my white stallion no longer has fly and sun irritation around his eyes. We're deep into the Chihuahua Desert here and it's both incredibly hot and bright almost year round - eye protection is a must for equines.",

            "question": "title: POTENTIALLY FATAL DESIGN FLAW - be careful!\ntext: Potentially deadly flaws with this collar. The design makes it tighten easily when the dog pulls on it, but it doesn't release easily to allow the dog to breathe again! This is a legitimate choking hazard or could potentially permanentnly damage your dogs windpipe, with possibly lethal consequences. It's important buyers know that, I'll try to explain exactly what the problem is...<br /><br />First, counterintuitively the slip portion goes through the O ring and then through one side of what is a pretty standard plastic snap mechanism which isn't made for easy sliding. Like any good standard snap it fits the nylon prety snug and the feed-though is angled. Just from messing around with it I can see it's much easier to pull the collar through the snap than it is to loosen it back - additionally there's no limit to the amount the collar can tighten as with a martingale collar.<br /><br />The danger is if your dog pulls on a walk the collar could cinch tight and not loosen back to neutral. At worst you'd be asphyxiating your dog, at best it doesn't loosen fast enough to reward the dog for not pulling. Slide the nylon through the snap for a while to get a feel for this effect and potentially loosen it up a bit. You could undo the snap when using the slip funtion but the D-ring with half the snap can fit through the O ring and get too loose, then prevent tightening the collar if your dog tries to slip out of it.<br /><br />Second issue: This isn't a safe collar to leave on your dog unattended, period, under any circumstance. If your dog were to get the D-ring caught on anything it would undoubtedly choke itself to death, no question. Nor should a dog ever be tied out in this collar without both the D and O rings clipped together (or better yet, not tied out in this at all). Similarly a dog should never be allowed to drag a leash from the D ring, even while supervised.<br /><br />This is a collar which should NOT be a dog's main collar, but used only in supervised training sessions if at all. If I can't work the collar to where it softens up and \"loosens\" back to neutral easily I'll return it, that's irresponsibly dangerous and can cause permanent damage to the dog's windpipe.<br /><br />The construction and materials appear quite good and solid, but the design is fundamentally flawed. They should have added a piece between the snap and slip portion through which the slip part of the collar could easily slide - running it through a standard snap, designed specially to limit collar slippage, is potentially fatal laziness on the manufacturer's part and quite frankly inexcusable. Dogs could literally die.<br /><br />Finally, be aware the collar runs large. I ordered a small and with the adjuster slid as big as it'd go it'd easily fit a German Shepard. I have it adjusted in the middle for my lanky 40lbs dog. Tightened up all the way it might work for a small dog with a thick neck, but I'd say the small size would be called a medium in most brands.",

            "question": "title: Show Your Dog You Care\ntext: Dogs love anything made with meat and as pet owners, we are often wary of feeding our dog canned food, however meaty and delicious it might be to a dog, due to the often questionable ingredients and fillers. Under the Sun Grain Free Adult Dog Wet Food Duck Formula puts these worries to rest with quality ingredients that are meat- centric and acceptable to most any dog owner.<br /><br />My dog eats a diet of mostly dry dog food, but we do like to top off his dry food with wet food as an occasional treat. Under the Sun Grain Free Adult Dog Wet Food Duck Formula is very good for this purpose. The meaty food is ground up into a fine mixture that makes it easy for a dog to eat and it could probably be handled by dogs at any age. My dog is around two years old and he had no problem eating this food along with his dry food.<br /><br />Under the Sun Grain Free Adult Dog Wet Food Duck Formula is a little bit pungent, like most wet dog foods, but it is actually quite bearable compared to some.

The other two pens are set up individually for our two buns that aren't a bonded pair yet so they can be side by side until they are ready to be together. I've had the first one for over two years and it is still in great shape, with only slight rusting of the clips that hold the panels together.  Not a big deal.  I'm really happy with these pens. They are great quality, very portable, easy to fold and store when not in use, and hold up well outside.  I leave mine out all year round and they have held up very well.

It's a real challenge to take them off without leaving very sharp points on the ball. But the tags on the Snoop and Nook are exceptionally dangerous. Luckily I thought to look inside each one before giving them to my dog. Of course, the other ends of the tags were inside, just waiting to fall out at some point and possibly end up inside my dog. I spent the next 15 minutes with a long pair of hemostats pulling them all out.<br />My dog loves playing with these and I hate that they are probably the only ones he will ever get to have. Even though I now know how to keep my dog safe with these toys, I refuse to support a company that knowing endangers my dog. I emailed them over a week ago and have yet to get a response, other than an acknowledgment that they received my email. This leads me to believe they simply don't care. They are more concerned about their tags than they are about my dog.<br />So be warned. And unless you have some long hemostats and a good bit of patience, do not buy these.

I use them for many purposes, and that would include rewards and just simply getting their attention, like when I want them to come inside from my backyard. I like having an assortment of treats and small treats are perfect for those times when you want to feed your dog a quick snack. This is what you get with these Cheese and Bacon treats from the Everlasting Pet Company.<br /><br />Heart shaped, these treats are dry and cookie- like. There is almost no smell at all, so you won‚Äôt gag when you open the pouch. The flavor features two things we know every dog loves: cheese and bacon. There should be no problem at all getting your four- legged family member to enjoy these treats.<br /><br />There is one added plus with these dog treats, and it‚Äôs something you don‚Äôt see with most dog treats. The package is 100 percent compostable. Another plus is that the family- owned business that makes these treats preps them at a factory that is solar powered. They obviously take their commitment to the planet seriously, to go along with their commitment to making quality treats for dogs.<br /><br />While these treats are crunchy, they are surprisingly grain free, which is yet another plus. The ingredient list is short, too, and free from the nasty chemicals you often see on the ingredient lists of other dog treats. Another plus? The package contains a large number of small treats, so a single pouch should last for a while.<br /><br />With so many plusses and no minuses, these bacon and cheese dog treats from the Everlasting Pet Company are a home run, both from my dog‚Äôs perspective and from mine! I can‚Äôt find anything negative to say about them, so they earn an easy 5 stars.",

I love the plaid It feels like a wool blend on one side, and nylon on the other. I see it is 2 layers sewn together. One end of the orange & gray one has come undone. Not sure if it came like that or if in the couple hours my cat was wearing it managed to do that.<br /><br />The break away mechanism does indeed work, as that is the only way to get it open. Pull, and it pulls apart. BUT This does not make either of my cats happy. I am currently getting the stink eye from my one kitty after putting it on and needing to take it off again to make it fit better.<br /><br />The bells are cute, but kinda hang low. That is probably typical of a cat collar. The bell is attached to a tiny key ring, then further attached to a mini D ring. I took it off even though it looked precious on my girls.  The product description has good pics of these collars.<br /><br />My 2 girls, \"the lady bugs\" were recently adopted. They are adults, and I called them that collectively before I gave them names (now Stella and Sophie). I still call them my little lady bugs. Anyway, both are tortoiseshell- one being the typical black and orange, and the other being a dilute- so she is gray with peach. The gray and orange looks great on the black/orange tortie while the gray & pink looks adorable on my dilute. The latter seems proud of her collar, while the other is well.. giving me the stink eye. I  may not put it back on her.. but it looks so cute.<br /><br />I definitely wouldn't get this for a dog. Between the cat buckle, the thin collar.. it really reminds me of cat only.

We give her benadryl at night (under full supervision of our vet) so she can rest, but we don't want to do that multiple times a days for weeks.<br /><br />I was skeptical of these chews, but we've given her 2 per day in the morning for 8 days now. She really likes the chews and they are easy for her to chew. Soft, but not mushy. I think these have helped her - she's not scratching as often during the day and seems happier. I'll keep using them as long as we see any improvement.",

However, I should have ordered a medium because the large is just a couple of inches too big. Nevertheless, I actually do not care for this harness. First, I found it very awkward to get this fastened. The harness just seems to \"ride\" too high (under the belly and close to the neck). Also the back strap glides from side to side and would be subject to movement as the leash is pulled from left to right. I would think this would irritate a dog or cat and also shift the harness around the pet's neck.

My priority was to get something with three SOFT beds that were high up (this is almost as tall as my husband who is 6ft) because we have dogs too and I wanted them to each have their own comfortable spot where they can lounge and not be bothered. This was exactly what I was hoping for. The beds on top have very soft fabric and soft cushions. My cats fit perfectly on top. The little caves are a huge hit as well, and have plenty of room for them to turn around and get comfortable in, or should you have larger cats I think it would easily accommodate them as well (see photos). I'll probably end up putting a soft cushion in the little caves too, but they don't even seem to mind because the fabric is so soft. It connects to the wall too, for safety, so in case they leap off or get the zoomies I don't have to worry about it crashing down and injuring on of them, or my puppies. Very happy.",

It is ergonomically designed and so easy to hold. It also feels great in my hands as there are finger bumps along the length of the handle.<br /><br />This brush is dual sided. I have three-long-haired cats and the wire bristles pick up a lot of hair; however, the nylon bristles act more like a massage brush than a hair brush. It hardly picks up any hair. It only picks up surface hair as that side is super gentle.<br /><br />I love this brush because of its feel, hold, and dual-purpose. The nylon bristle side is good for pets who are not used to being brushed or just prefer light grooming. The wire pin side is for more vigorous hair removal.<br /><br />Normally, I would rate this 4 stars due to the lack of hair pick-up on the one side. However, I love this brush so much that I am rating it 5 stars because it is so easy to work with.

In fact, one of them would consume two cans plus small portions of dry food per day. However, I try to use these as a treat or special meal every other day to balance their diets. Both of my cats are extremely healthy, but that is not due solely to this food - they have been pampered with the best regular diets and routine vet visits. But I am sure that this food is a contributing factor.<br /><br />On rare occasions I also treat my feral colony with a feast comprised of a can for each of them.

But I at least try to stick with treats that are healthier than most and one good example is AlphaPaws Dentalicious dog treats.<br /><br />These dog treats are designed to help clean a dog‚Äôs teeth. They have ridges which are intended to get between a dog‚Äôs teeth and help scrape away plaque and tartar. In addition to that, the treats are made with parsley and botanical oils to freshen breath. The treats are thinner than most and a little easier to chew and swallow.<br /><br />I have two dogs and they love most any dog treat. These treats are not quite as appealing as others, but they still enjoy them. They don‚Äôt go ga- ga over these treats like they do other dog treats, but in many ways this is good. It prevents them from eating too much, too quickly. And they still like the treats and I like that they are healthier than most.<br /><br />Dogs love treats, especially those with a meaty flavor and texture. These treats are not quite like that, but they make up for it with their quality ingredients and teeth- cleaning ability. It adds up to a good, quality dog treat overall that is easily worth it to serve to your dog.",

The smallest was a ~45 lbs boxer mix, two were labs, and lately a 90 lb husky / shepherd mix. The short handle is great as we cross the street, pass people on the side walk - or if there is a mail truck anywhere nearby. This 8' leash is perfect for our walks to the park. As the weather warms up my dog enjoys spending some time in the creek. The 6' leash doesn't quite let him get to the deep spot to cool off - but the extra length on this 8' leash is perfect! The padded handles are a fantastic bonus.",

My two labs enjoy this as a food topper. I have a (non grain free) base of food that I stick with for them, but do use other brands as a topper, as a treat, as a stuffer for their treat puzzles, and for sniffing session (in the grass, in a snuffle mat, etc). I often prefer a good quality food over a bag of treats as I do keep track of calories and overall nutrition intake. Lots of good ingredients here, so I am happy to have this for them to have on occasion.<br /><br />Whenever I use freeze dried food with them, I make sure to add a little water or broth anyway. I just figure they may need extra moisture. Sometimes I let this soak, then it turns into a chunky mash. My dogs think it tastes better than that sounds, lol.<br /><br />Typical kibble size- roundish and flat-ish<br /><br />The 4 lb bag is dense, it is well packaged- had a vacuum sealed feel to it. Fresh!<br /><br />No problems thus far. For us, the 4 lb bag will last quite awhile since it is a supplementary food/treat for us. $20 is a bargain for that purpose!<br /><br />PS. Take note of the calories. It is on the higher side per cup, so you will likely feed less than you would with many other brands. Feed according to your dogs caloric needs. My girl is on a diet, so I am always aware of these things.",

I‚Äôm always on the lookout for quality dog food and the combination of nutrition and a food that supposedly helps with skin issues- and digestive concerns- convinced me to try Hill‚Äôs Science Diet Adult Sensitive Stomach and Skin Grain Free Chicken and Potato Recipe Dry Dog Food.<br /><br />Poured from the ziploc style bag, this dog food consists of small kibbles, each shaped like a flat disk. The dry food is typical of other dry dog foods, so no issues there. My dog likes it about as much as he likes other dog foods. That means he will eat it in due time, but he would much prefer a freshly cooked steak.<br /><br />With the ingredients, I like that the food is grain free and consists of chicken as the first ingredient, followed by an assortment of other ingredients including several fruits and vegetables. The ingredient list is long and there are certainly a few items in there that could get some dog owner‚Äôs attention, but it is still better than the ingredients found in most other dog foods.<br /><br />As for the skin and stomach claims, I can vouch that the stomach claims seem valid. My dog doesn‚Äôt seem to have any issues at all surrounding his stomach and his stools are more solid. With the skin, well, I can‚Äôt really detect any difference since he still scratches just as much as before. It could take more time for these positive results to show up, but regardless, the other qualities make this dog food worth purchasing.<br /><br />I have always had good luck with Hill‚Äôs dog food products and Hill‚Äôs Science Diet Adult Sensitive Stomach and Skin Grain Free Chicken and Potato Recipe Dry Dog Food is certainly an excellent choice for the concerned dog owner. It is free from grain, helps with digestion, and is packaged in an easy to use, reseal bag. Another excellent dog food from Hill‚Äôs, one of the best names in the business.",

Pack of two is nice.<br /><br />Neither of my labs are heavy chewers. Every toy they have owned over the years have held up, even cheapie toys. I expect this to as well. I wouldn't give any soft toy to an aggressive chewer. I dont know why people do that, and then complain about the toy. Only toys that hold up with aggressive chewers are the harder, rubber style. So if you have a dog that seeks to destroy, then this is not suitable. All play should be monitored.<br /><br />My big boy looks so silly with this toy dangling out from his mouth. I crack up when he just sits there and looks at me with his \"cigar\". My girl doesn't really play much with toys, but she will use them to manipulate her toy loving brother to move out from a preferred spot on the couch. She will also use them to engage in some tug of war. Even in that style of play, they are gentle. This toy has held up (so far) to that.<br /><br />The photoshopped pictures on this product page are hilarious. Just so you know, each toy measures about 9\" long.

My girl really enjoys these crunchy cookies\ntext: Crunchy cookie sized treats that smell good, look good, have great ingredients, priced well, and are packaged nicely in a pressure zip durable plastic bag. We have quickly become a Wag family!<br /><br />I have two labs. My boy is super picky about treats, but seems to love Wag Chicken n Waffles bites.<br />https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07V9Z4GZW<br /><br />And so I buy a big bag for him on Subscribe and Save every month. My girl enjoys most treats, and since the other Wag treats are so well received, we had to try these crunchy biscuits. My girl loves them. Her eyes lit up when I presented a couple of biscuits to her. And my boy...well he snubbed them (not surprised). So  I grabbed him a \"Chicken n' Waffles\" chewy wafer treat instead. They both got to enjoy a nice treat of Wag snacks. We have tried Wag freeze dried treats, chewy jerky treats, chicken n waffle bites, and now these biscuits. All have been good, just a matter of finding what my babies like best and I have had no qualms in repurchasing for them.<br /><br />Be mindful of calories. Each treat is 34 calories. Not bad, as these are robust, thick cookies. But since my girl is on a diet, I have to be sure to not give her more than a couple per day. I wont let her read the back of the bag as the recommended amount is 7-14 treats for a dog of her size. lol<br /><br />24 ounces actually is quite a big bag and provides a lot of treats. I may add this into my regular orders, and I would totally feel comfortable giving this as part of a pet themed gift, or as a bag of snacks to have on hand for any visiting doggos. Or to buy for purpose of donation (doesnt break the bank!). I dont rate on price, but it is truly refreshing that these are healthy, quality treats that are really reasonably priced.

I spread one full of peanut butter and stuck it to the tub surround wall. A few things to note here... these pads have a lot of suction cups, but they're quite small. My tub surround is tile and due to the size of this pad vs the size of my tiles, I had no option to position it where the suction cups did not align with the grout line in between the tiles. This caused the pad to not want to stick to the wall very well. I would also suggest to not spread your treat (peanut butter, in my case) on to the pad before you put it on the wall. Due to my lack of suction issue, I had to press hard all over the circumference of the pad which led to peanut butter drenched fingers (but Skip was more than happy to help me out with that hiccup lol). So come next bath time, I'll be sure to stick the pad to the wall *first*, pressing anywhere and as hard as I want/need to get the small suction cups to do they're thing... and *then* bring the peanut butter into play. Other than those two minor issues, this pad worked wonders keeping Skip's full attention throughout the entire duration of his bath! When we were done, I called him out of the tub and he looked at me like \"Oh! Did I just have a bath?\" as if he had totally forgotten even walking into the bathroom to begin with. LOL!! I'll certainly be using these lick pads repeatedly! (I may even have to use both since Skip nearly finished cleaning the peanut butter off the pad before I was done with his rinse cycle!)",

It seems that grass irritates him in between his toes and then he overbathes them. The concept of these socks is simple enough. It‚Äôs like an oversized water balloon. He patiently allowed me to stretch them on to his feet even though this was quite difficult as the ankle opening looked about 10 sizes too small. (I followed sizing measurement, and chose accordingly). The foot part size was fine; however, the leg part was very concerning because it was so tight. Sure enough within about ten minutes of wear, I did a health check on his legs and there was already some apparent swelling above the top due to these cutting off the circulation.  This can do permanent damage so I immediately removed them. With sadness, I began to carefully pack the four that he used in a separate ziplock bag to prepare my return. While I was writing a post it note indicating that these four had now been worn, I noticed black dog hair on the INSIDE of the package that contained the remaining 8 (this was a 12-pack). My dog is blonde. With trepidation, I started to more closely examine the contents and found more stranger dog hair and to my horror found that there were four socks that were soiled with dirt, hair, and other contamination. We are in the state of a GLOBAL PANDEMIC and I now had some other person‚Äôs and dog‚Äôs filth sitting on my kitchen counter. I am not mad at the dog or the persons who returned but am absolutely disgusted with the lack of quality control on the seller‚Äôs part to have allowed this to happen.  It was a plastic container that snapped together. After disinfecting the amazon packaging and outer package of this item, I had absolutely no reason to sanitize further. Excuse my frankness, but a valid comparison would be to buy a men‚Äôs pack of underwear, pull out a few pairs, go back for more as needed and find a skidder stain on the bottom one. This was a gross find in any circumstance, but in the height of Covid danger, it was gross negligence and extremely careless.

He's been eating Beneful dog food his entire life so it wasn't really a surprise that he wolfed down the Beneful wet dog food ! He literally licked his bowl clean!<br /><br />Mac did experience a few bouts of vomiting after eating the wet food.  He was fine immediately after vomiting, it didn't cause any type of illness. He wasn't in any pain.  IDK if its due to the fact  he's 7 years old and has been eating dry food his entire life and that's why he experienced some vomiting after eating wet food. It didn't happen every single time he ate the wet food.  Because of his occasional vomiting, Mac still eats mainly Beneful salmon Superfoods dry dog food but every couple of days I put a spoonful of Beneful wet dog food with the dry food. He wolfs it down and, so far so good. No vomiting My sister also has a bichon. I gave her 3 containers of the wet food for her dog. He didn't have ANY issues at all. I also gave a neighbor 1 container for her dog and he was fine as well. (He's not a bichon...he's a little chihuahua. ) Beneful dry dog food and Beneful wet dog food contain  healthy ingredients and wholeome grains.  Doesn't matter which  one your dog eats, he'll be  eating healthy food either way.  On an unrelated note, check your Sunday newspaper coupons for Beneful coupons. They're in frequently.<br /><br />I had a blond moment and accidentally deleted the photo of him eating his Beneful wet dog food.  But I DID get a picture of our cat enjoying some Beneful wet dog food! (He only licked the gravy for a few seconds while I took the above picture. This was the ONLY time  he ate dog food...and it was just gravy)<br /><br />You want your furbaby to be as healthy as possible and live a nice, long life. He can do that with Beneful dog food!  And its VERY reasonably priced!",

Finally, after having basically given up on finding something they would both like, I decided to give Higgins Vita Seed a try.

Two dogs enthusiastically¬†ate this but the third one gave it a lukewarm reception and just smelled it but would not eat it. As you can see, they are spoiled by being hand fed.<br /><br />The food itself is small, dark, and¬†round. This is made in the U.S.A. (i.e. Ohio) but I am unsure where the ingredients are sourced from.<br /><br />The ingredients are good except for the lentils and peas (see note). The first 18 ingredients are¬†¬†buffalo meal, red lentils, green peas, chickpeas, lamb meal, canola oil, carrots, celery, beets, parsley, lettuce, watercress, spinach, tomato pomace, Menhaden fish oil, ground flax seed, natural flavor, lecithin, etc.<br /><br />Note that unless a dog has a grain allergy, it is not a good idea to feed them grain-free foods exclusively. The reason is that vets are finding an association between heart disease (such as canine dilated cardiomyopathy) and grain-free dog foods. This disease is mostly associated with the foods that have peas, lentils, other legumes or potatoes as their main ingredients and this food has lentils, peas, and chickpeas. Nevertheless, I feel it is okay to feed this food to a dog only to supplement a dog's diet and not as an exclusive meal.<br /><br />I love that the bag has a zippered closure. This ensures that the kibble stays fresh.<br /><br />The current price of $17.99 for 4 pounds is competitive but expensive.

Screw holes on the legs DO NOT match up. Not much of a problem, holding fine with one screw each (yes it‚Äôs the correct side).<br />It is slightly tilted back? The legs are positioned right despite the missing screws. And everything else is good. It‚Äôs a minor tilt backwards and doesn‚Äôt affect my dog. Just me being picky.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Adjustable heights, easy to wipe down, rubber pads easy to clean, non slip ACTUALLY WORKS.<br />No bulky base, my dog always has hit her feet on the bottom base of raised stands and it scares her. (She‚Äôs handicap and can‚Äôt walk well) She doesn‚Äôt have to stretch so far and can come right up to the bowls.<br />BEST FEATURE IS YOU CAN USE ANY BOWL YOU WANT!!! Most raised stands use basic bowls, restricting you from using a custom bowl. The trays are large enough for a good size bowl.",

            "question": "title: Definitely controls odors ...\ntext: The look of this cat litter is quite different from the usual \"fine grained\" clay litter.  The \"bits' are much larger -- It took a few days for my cats to get used to this.  I think they were a little uncomfortable with the \"feel\" of it, but they got over it fairly soon.  I mention this because the difference might cause your cat to resist using the litter box, too.  Yes, we had a couple of \"messes,\" but I stuck with it, and they're totally fine with it now.<br /><br />That said, this stuff really does suppress odors.  I usually try to scoop the box at least once a day, but I do sometimes let it sit overnight.  With my old litter, I would start to get a whiff of the odor the next morning; not so with this stuff.<br /><br />It's more expensive, but it might be worth it in the long run.  My cats have had allergy problems in the past with clay litters, including unscented, and even some \"all-natural\" non-clay litters.  So far, I've seen no signs of the usual allergy issues with this stuff.  That alone will make this worth the expense.",

She naps on both levels, plays on it, and prefers this for sharpening her claws to anything else in the house.<br /><br />I was initially concerned because as she used the hammock part, it stretched downward. However, this has resulted in forming a nest that seems to be the perfect depth for her comfort, and it has not continued to stretch out past that point.  The fabric hasn't shed into the room at all, but there have only been a couple of little fuzz-balls that came loose and ended up in the bottom of the hammock.  The entire unit remains sturdy, solid, and in excellent condition.<br /><br />It was super-easy to assemble; you attach the hammock first, and then the base (essentially, assembling it upside-down).  Assembly took me only 1-2 minutes.  I haven't needed to retighten or readjust anything at all since first putting it together.<br /><br />The size and configuration make it easy reposition if desired. It doesn't dominate the room, visually screaming &#34;CAT TREE!&#34;  But it seems to give her the same benefits that a larger cat tree would.<br /><br />This is a product which is truly a great value.",

We're definitely having territory issues, so this wall unit gives the kitties more options. They do like to be up high. The instructions were easy enough to follow, though I wish they had added the picture from the product description as a way to place the pieces on the wall. With that being said, the picture on the description has the pieces in reverse which was a little confusing. It says you can hang them anyway you want, but we felt that we needed some specific guidance as to how it would work best for kitties to use. We did have to remove one piece from the wall after installing it because the hole didn't line up well enough for the kitties to access that shelf. We do have some wall patching to do now. Once installed, they seem pretty sturdy. The two new cats are small, but our original one is a bit chonky and I'm not sure if it will work for her. But because of her heft, I don't see her trying it anyway. It looks nice. I haven't seen anyone use it other than the time we placed a cat up there. Time will tell.<br /><br />*Update - My daughter thought it would be fun to put our chonky cat up on this. I warned her, but she did it anyway. While it didn't fall down, it did become loose. When we installed it, we did not attach it to a stud. Although the directions don't require to find a stud to secure it to the wall, I strongly recommend that you do so.",

He had his favorites, and I bought like the Coneheads, by the case. We had a LOT of canned cat food left.<br />Enter the new kids.  They were fostered by someone we didn't know, and were adopted through a PetSmart adoption event. WE had no idea what they were eating before they came to us. But let me tell you - they were PICKY.<br />Cats are notoriously picky eaters, so I expected experimentation. BUT - I was expecting to find favorite FLAVORS, like chicken, tuna, salmon, etc etc.<br />Nope.<br />Just nope.<br /><br />These two were TEXTURE freaks.<br />Of course, my cases of cat food were not the right texture for them. *eye roll*<br />While tempting to just say \"Starve then!!\", of course, I am too soft for that.  |<br />And so began the Great Cat Food Texture Experiment.<br />We bought several individual cans from an area store - no more cases of stuff until we figure this out!<br /><br />Shreds - not a chance. Both tried to bury them.<br />Bits - gravy licked off, the food uneaten and deemed revolting by both food critics.<br />Chunky - nope.  Again, great disdain shown for the insult of trying to serve them chunky food. Eventually, gravy would be licked off and food spit out on the floor.  *sigh*<br />Pat√© - We are getting closer.  There was more acceptance of this texture. Good, we are making headway. I buy pat√© in a few brands. Good heavens, the insult!!  How dare I feed royalty this peasant chow? But through trial and error, we did finally find one that the royal kings deemed acceptable.<br />That was Sheba brand pat√©.  Yes, they finally found something they like!  Hallelujah!  (Now, we had never bought Sheba brand of any texture before, because our previous cat had a love affair with Fancy Feast. We bought the Sheba as a shot in the dark.)<br /><br />So now, they like nearly any flavor, as long as it is Sheba, with the exception of the turkey. That's a hard pass, unless starvation has set in and they have not eaten in a couple hours. LOL But it is at the bottom of their list.<br />So yes, we spoil our babies and buy their favorite Sheba food, again by the case.<br /><br />My ONLY complaint about them is that those skinny double-packets are beastly hard for me to open.<br />My fingers are not as nimble as they used to be.  I also fear a painful foil cut while wrestling off the tops.<br />So now I grab the tab and use a washcloth to keep a decent grip and shield my fingers from the tops.<br /><br />Sheba has won over the two harshest food critics we've ever owned. For that, I thank them.<br />I want to be sure they get enough moisture in their diets, and wet food helps with that.<br />Four paws up at our house for the Sheba Seafood Entr√©es, our boys' favorite.",

I‚Äôm so glad I did!!<br />This carrier still has very usable shoulders strap handles- but is made so much stronger then, what I even hoped for!! The base has never caused any issue or, worry about collapsing.  Also, the doors unzip from both sides for convenience and open so wide which is nice for That ‚Äúnaughty dog‚Äù you can‚Äôt get into the carrier ...multi openings are convenient and the fact that this collapses for easy storage, is a welcomed and helpful bonus- this collapse is so small, it can slide under the bed with ease. This has (de)attachable pouch to carry dog Leash, treats, food, toys, accessories and keeps these items free and clear from your pup getting into the pouch itself. This is made of a durable solid material, has plenty of viewing/ventilation screens... and you can see the integrity it boasts, just by looking at it!!<br />This comes in various colors too so, if you wanted to match the decor inside your home‚Ä¶ You have choices to do just that and it can stay up and not be a rainbow of wrong color in the house! (Unless, that‚Äôs the look you‚Äôre going for ha ha!)<br /><br />If you need a carrier that has strength and the need to work well... a carrier with all the ability to hold your dog with peace of mind it will work- this is exactly that!

The color of these holders are light pink. They are not \"creme\" or flesh-toned in color as the Amazon photo shows. I actually like the pink color much better than the flesh color shown.<br /><br />These holders work well to carry a poop bag and there are several ways they can be carried. All I have to do is push the knotted bag through the Y slit in the holder and then either hold the carrier with my fingers, hook the loop onto something using the supplied carabiner, or loop the holder around the leash (see photo). This allows me to carry it hands free as long as I am not hooking the loop onto my fingers.<br /><br />There are two negatives to me. One carabiner should be supplied for each holder. Also, when looping this holder around the leash, the holder slides to the bottom of the leash unless there is a knot or something that stops it from sliding (like a bag clip). Of course, if the leash handle is thinner than the one I have, it can be looped around the handle so it does not slide. Had a carabiner been supplied for each poop bag holder, this would have received 5 stars.

I need steps for an 80lb Ridgeback that will also hold up to the rest of the pack. I will say this... after 24 hours, the steps are holding up to a variety of dogs in a variety of weights as they try them out and learn to use them. (Meaning that so far the steps have not collapsed or fallen apart) They are NOT all that easy to put together - the so called &#34;Snap together&#34; process isn't quite that simple. They were very wobbly after being &#34;snapped&#34; together, so I took out the hammer and gave several solid whacks on both sides. No more wobbles and there will be no deconstructing these steps either. One note for assembly - none of my pieces were labeled to match the included diagrams in the directions. Not a big deal, the photos were pretty easy to follow and common sense will direct you easily enough, but if you need the literal &#34;Part A attaches to Part B&#34; type directions then be aware that the pieces are NOT MARKED.<br /><br />The carpet treads on each step do remove and go back into place easily enough with nice wide velcro strips. We have tile floors where these steps are being used and rather than risk any slippage at all, I put a nonslip rug under them before allowing the dogs access. The steps do have little rubber footie things on the underside, but better safe than sorry. It doesn't take up as much floor space as I thought it would and that is a nice plus.<br /><br />*******************JULY 2011 UPDATE ****************************************************************************************************<br /><br />These steps have held up really well since I bought them in April of 2010. We've gone through phases of the dogs not using them at all and then every day one or more of the hounds will be using them. The only negative thing I can really say at this point is the angle of the steps is a tad steep for my Dad's Chihuahua. However, 50lb Beagle Mixes and 90lb Rhodesian Ridgebacks don't seem phased at all.<br /><br />******Update August 2015 ******<br /><br />After five years, these steps are still in use here and still in one piece. I have upgraded my rating to four stars. I've never been able to take them apart, but they have never fallen apart either. They do need a non slip rug under them for use on wood or time floors, but that's ok.",

I like to feed them treats each day and insist on a high level of quality. A dog treat that meets my stringent requirements is Pet Jerky Factory Turkey Jerky.<br /><br />Starting with the quality, I felt good about these treats immediately, before I even opened the package. These treats are all natural; no artificial preservatives, colors, or flavors. They are grain free, too, so there are no added fillers that do little to benefit a dog‚Äôs good health.<br /><br />With the taste, my pair of pups love what these jerky treats offer. One good thing, from my perspective, is that they take a little longer to eat. I don‚Äôt like the treats that my dogs inhale within seconds because it serves little purpose and they immediately want another treat. With these treats, my dogs at least spend a little time chewing. This keeps them preoccupied, and that is good.<br /><br />Pet Jerky Factory Turkey Jerky are human grade and based on the ingredients and other factors, some people might be tempted to use them for their own midnight snack. Resist, and let your dog enjoy them. They are an excellent, high quality dog treat and one of my dogs‚Äô favorites.",

            "question": "title: Has a ton of fillers, but the cats like the taste\ntext: Okay, I admit it.<br />I was sucked in my the most adorable, romantic commercials for a cat food product that I have<br />ever seen. I vowed to buy at least some Fancy Feast each week just to show my support for that commercial!  LOL<br /><br />The cats love the wet food. It is very expensive, and from what I have read on the labels, you are<br />definitely paying for the IMAGE, not the quality or quantity of the food. (The cans are only 3 ounces<br />compared with 5.5 ounces in the other can styles.) I still get it, and they love the ones with cheese the most.<br /><br />So, I thought we'd give the dry food a try. I had my husband grab a bag when he was at the grocery store.<br />How bad could it be, right?  Same company, same \"gourmet\" promotion on the foods, so surely it has great stuff<br />in it, right?  Well, shocker - NOPE.<br /><br />Fancy Feast is made by the Purina company in St Louis, MO. They are the same ones who make the generic dog chow,<br />cat chow, rabbit chow, ________ (fill in the blank with a critter name) chow.<br />They are all full of fillers that animals don't need,<br />because it is cheap to manufacture. Why I thought this might be different, I do not know.<br /><br />First off, food mfgs have found the kitty equivalent of addictive MSG, and load their foods with it.<br />This one is no different. Note that BOTH our cats went crazy over this food, inhaling it out of my hand<br />before I could even get more out of the package. Fancy Feast knows how to make things that smell/taste good to cats.<br />However, most food mfgs know how to make things that TASTE good - how they got there, well, you might not really want to know.<br /><br />Here's the ingredients list (which is in the order of the QUANTITY of the item) for this \"gourmet\" cat chow - bear with me, this is<br />a really long list of iffy ingredients, artificial junk and food coloring):<br /><br />Brewers Rice<br />Poultry By Product Meal<br />CORN GLUTEN meal<br />Animal fat preserved with mixed tocopherols<br />Ground Yellow Corn<br />Soybean Meal<br />Animal Liver Flavor<br />Chicken<br />Turkey<br />Phosphoric Acid<br />Calcium Carbonate (in case they get indigestion?! This is what's in Tums!)<br />Salt<br />Natural & Artificial Flavors<br />Potassium Chloride<br />Dried Yeast<br />Choline Chloride<br />Added Color, Red 40, Yellow 5, Blue 2 and \"other colors\" (Why?!? Cats are mostly color blind anyway)<br />Taurine<br />Zinc Sulfate<br />Ferrous Sulfate<br />Vitamin E Supplement<br />Niacin<br />Manganese Sulfate<br />Vitamin A Supplement<br />Calcium Pantothenate<br />Thiamine Mononitrate<br />Copper Sulfate<br />Riboflavin Supplement<br />Vitamin B12 Supplement<br />Pyridoxine<br />Hydrochloride<br />Folic Acid<br />Vitamin D3 Supplement<br />Calcium Iodate<br />Biotin<br />Menadione Sodium Bisulfite Complex (a form of Vit K)<br />Sodium Selenite.<br /><br />Sounds yummy, huh?<br />The meat is way down the list, after all the corn, soybean and rice fillers, various meals (meaning<br />conglomerate of parts chipped up and dried out) and glutens.<br /><br />How on earth does cat food need artificial food dyes?  The cats won't care.<br />There are many known reactions to food dyes in people - I am sure our pets don't need it either.<br />Cats are color-blind to most colors, so it wasn't for visual appeal to them.<br />Was the food too yellow with all the grain meal and gluten, or too white from all the fats?<br /><br />So, the cats love it.<br />I will now consider this the equivalent of a bag of potato chips for humans -<br />okay some times, but NOT all the time. I'll have to watch our oldest cat. He gets super itchy with wheat<br />grain or gluten in foods, so I'll watch for reactions to the corn.<br /><br />Cats are carnivorous, and do not eat grains in the wild. However, especially with the manufacturing plant<br />smack dab in farming country, they can apparently get all kinds of leftover grains cheap?<br /><br />If you buy this for your kitties, just know that you are buying the IMAGE more than a quality food.<br />This is not really different than the super cheap pet food. Prettier bag perhaps, but image is<br />what you are paying for here.<br /><br />Overall, I was really disappointed to read that ingredients list, when they could do SO much better for our pets.<br />We'll use this as their treats, rather than their main dry food.<br />We'll stick with our Blue Buffalo for that, which is grain free and actually has meat for the first ingredient!<br /><br />Fancy Feast - marketing genius, but sloppy on the actual nutrition.",

Puppy surely threw up green strands that night but he‚Äôs fine.<br /><br />This item may be better for someone with an older puppy past the chewing phase. Or ‚Äúeat everything ‚Äúphase...

Not only does he enjoy the taste and chewing on the Kookamunga rawhide, but they also help to reduce plaque and tartar on his teeth.  Talk about a win-win situation! The price is incredible. One bag will last 4 months!  You can't beat that. I happened to notice the expiration date is 2021, so with the resealable bag the rawhides come in, these treats will stay fresh for a LONG time.  Absolutely worth every penny!  They're cheaper than another other brand Mac has ever tried, he can have one daily and he LOVES them!  He has no trouble chewing/digesting these treats at all.

I bought these for use on couch and dog bed (I bought two) for times when my creek loving labs come in with swamp dampened fur. I never seem to get them fully dried off, so them having a towel or easy to clean blanket helps mop up the rest of their wetness. Been using it like so for few weeks now, washed them a couple of times. Feels dense but soft.<br /><br />How I found out that they are REALLY waterproof is that once in awhile one of my cats will decide to PEE on the couch or dog bed. I tossed this on their dog bed, which is sort of loose looking (as opposed to couch where it seems to stay straightened out), and I noticed that it was holding pee. The pee had not soaked into the material. SO I carefully picked it up and poured off the pee. In hindsight, I should have tossed a towel on it to soak up the pee instead of trying to walk through the house with a puddle of pee.<br /><br />It is waterproof. That's great. If using it to keep liquids from a place that can easily be washed, then this will do it. However, I would top it with something that can soak up the liquid. So for me, I will put this on the couch cushion then top it with a big towel or small easy to wash blanket. Then pee (or whatever) will hit that first, soak up, and THIS cover will keep the pee (or other liquid) from seeping down to cushion, mattress, etc.<br /><br />It's durable feeling material, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it for providing extra protection from nails, claws, wear and tear and such, as well as the waterproof aspect. One of the pictures from a review shows what I experienced: the liquid sits on top. So yeh, it is waterproof.<br /><br />I'll update if I experience anything else worth sharing, especially if I notice it not working anymore.",

Pull-Top Cans]].<br /><br />There are 40 cans in the box. Note that many of the cat food cans arrived dented (1st and 2nd photo) even though the package was not damaged.<br /><br />There are 10 cans of each of:<br /><br />- Extra Gravy Chunky with Salmon in Savory Gravy (3 cats do not like--poultry 2nd, liver 3rd, & salmon 6th ingredient) - 4th & 5th photo<br /><br />- Tasty Treasures with Ocean Fish, Tuna, & Cheese in Sauce (3 cats like--liver 2nd, fish 5th & 9th, & chicken 6th ingredient)<br /><br />- Indoor Chunky Chicken & Turkey Casserole with Garden Greens (3 cats LOVE--chicken 2nd, liver 5th, & turkey 9th ingredient) - 3rd photo<br /><br />- Tasty Treasures with Turkey & Cheese in Gray (2 cats like, 1 cat LOVES--turkey 2nd & liver 3rd ingredient)<br /><br />My three cats use to love Friskies a long time ago but then stopped liking it. I tried many other types of food, including very expensive ones. Finally, the only type they would eat is the Fancy Feast brand and only several different flavors.  Therefore, I was excited to try Friskies again and they love this more than their Fancy Feast.<br /><br />Usually, I feed only one 3 ounce can of Fancy Feast per day to three cats because they do not each much. However, with this Friskies, I am able to feed them two 5.5 ounce cans per day and they eat most if not all of it. The only one they dislike is the salmon. They lick the gravy off the salmon dish and leave the rest.<br /><br />Overall, this is a hit; however, I do not care for the dented cans.

He still chooses to sleep in my bed about 5 nights out of 7, but every now and then, he'll choose this bed instead.  During the day, since it's next to my desk, he sleeps in it more and seems to go about 50/50 between it and the couch or my bed.  He's a nester, so he curls up small, even though he's a big, brawny 75 pound pit bull.  This bed is plenty big for him AND a king-sized human pillow that he loves to sleep with.  If he liked to really stretch out, this bed would not be big enough, but he curls up 80% of the time, so it suits him just fine.  It's a little softer than I thought it would be, so to add some stability to the bolstered sides, I put a 2-inch thick piece of egg crate foam underneath the sleeping part, and I had an old king-sized duvet that I just sort of rolled up and I put that butting up to and just under the bed on 3 sides - it's against a wall, so there are only 3 exposed sides.  The rolled-up duvet helps to &#34;bolster&#34; the bolsters.  He's a heavy dog, so he needs the extra support.  Would have given it a 5 if the bolstered sides were firmer and the sleeping surface a little thicker.<br /><br />TIP:  Instead of disassembling the bed to wash the cover - just buy a crib-size sheet or two, they have them in cozy flannels - and then just cover the bed with the sheet.  This way you just strip off the dirty sheet and replace with the extra one and it takes about 10 seconds or less.",

No wonder they didn't want to stop eating them!<br /><br />Anyway, we were on the hunt for a healthier treat that wasn't full of kitty junk food.<br />Both our cats love chicken and could care less about tuna or fish flavors, so this was one of the items we tried.<br />The ingredients are top-notch, and the treat's size is really good for cats.<br /><br />However, while both cats get excited about the bag being opened (like a can opener sound or popping the lid on wet cat food),<br />I could swear I hear them sigh when they see this bag! While they do eat these, it isn't a favorite by any means. Both will eat a few pieces then walk away, almost unheard of in all previous treat feeds of all brands. I can leave a few out and they'll get eaten, but it is probably out of boredom, not because they want them. One of our favorite games with both cats is tossing a treat for them to catch. They both love to do this, but are too bored to play catch with these treats. While I am glad that these do not contain the kitty version of MSG, it also needs to have something more appealing to the cats too.<br /><br />There is enough chicken in this to make it a decent product for your cat. However, there also doesn't seem to be a lot of flavor, in their opinion. While I did not buy mine at Amazon, no matter where you shop, Halo treats are pretty costly, given what<br />they are - little round pieces of cat food.<br /><br />We won't be buying them again. For a few dollars more, we can get a 3-lb sack of very healthy cat food that we can use as treats instead. Right now, we are using Blue Buffalo cat food as their treat. They both adore it, it is full of healthy ingredients too (despite being more grains than I really think cats need), and you get a lot more value. We also use Eukanuba dry food as treats, and both of those brands are very popular with both of our cats.<br /><br />So, while everyone's cats have different likes/dislikes just like we humans do, I'd put my money into some other brand.<br />If this one came way down in price, then it would be an okay value as an extra treat.<br />But, for the premium pricing on a bag of treats, you can do just as well by your cat with other brands.<br />There is nothing really special about these, and don't have either the flavor or fragrance to get our cats too excited about them.<br />I think we were all a little disappointed with the Halo chicken treats.",

I have tried several of the Amazon Solimo products and find them to generally be of comparable quality to name brands and I certainly would try any of the products over a name brand when the price is better.  The price for this dog food seems reasonable, but I think for a few dollars more you could get a much higher quality dog food.  What I didn't realize when I ordered this is that CORN is the number one ingredient in this food and not chicken.  It is only chicken flavored, which could mean just about anything.  As with any dog food, if you are okay with the ingredients and the price, try it and see if you dog likes it.  Just like people, dogs have their own individual tastes.  I think the Solimo brand (which I think is rather new) shows a lot of promise, but of course some of their products will be better than others.  This food claims to meet certain feeding standards, so it is worth trying to see if your dog relishes it or shuns it.",

After 2 sleepless nights, I was finally exhausted and ready to go to sleep. I climbed into bed for a short mid-afternoon nap. Just as I was drifting off to sleep, a loud thud (and I do mean LOUD) followed by a scratching noise had me wide awake.  Turns out, the cat's Legendog catnip toys had arrived! My husband had placed the packaging envelope on the dresser for me to open (he didn't know what was inside) after my nap but our cat Squeaky, had no intention of waiting for me to wake up! lol.  It was he who hopped on the dresser once he caught a whiff of the catnip and knocked a bottle of perfume off (didn't break it, thankfully) and began to scratch away at the envelope to try to get the toys out. lolol. These toys are SO SO SO cute! They come in a VERY nice bag-(so nice if these are a gift for someone, you won't need to wrap it! ) All 5 toys are soft and such cute designs. They're well made.  No holes or loose strings/threads anywhere. And, of course, they've got catnip in them. These toys even have our other cat, Miss Piggy playing like never before. She is 10 years old and was never super into cat toys, lasers, etc. .  She likes to sleep and...sleep! Now that she had her Legendog catnip toys, she has more energy than ever before.  She goes bonkers for the toys, batting them all over the house, pouncing on them and chewing them. You'd never know these cats of ours are 11 and 10 years old, they're BOTH acting like playful kittens now! After over a week of daily play from 2 cats, all 5 toys are still in exceptional condition.  Legendog cat nip toys are definitely worthy of gift giving. They're SO well made and provide hours upon hours of fun for cats.  I noticed they are an 'Amazon's Choice' product, meaning they are 'highly rated and well-priced products'.  And they definitely are! I went to the Legendog store's Amazon page and realized our dog Mac has the Legendog hedgehog toy which is one of his favorites. He's had it for YEARS and plays with it often.  Its still in exceptional condition. I definitely recommend Legendog catnip toys for your furbabies.  Have fun watching your cats turn into playful, energetic kittens right before your very eyes!",

After researching, this seemed to be the best one for me. It has a few things I don't like, but I really love it because my house doesn't smell at all. I mean really...no litter pan smell. There are a few things that could be better. When the rake dumps the dirty litter in the waste container, there isn't a tight seal. Because of this, you end up with litter on the floor under the box. Also, I do not like that I have to keep buying the waste receptacles. They could have made it where a bag can fit over the receptacle so that you can just change the bag instead of the whole plastic receptacle. I ordered a box of them, and they arent cheap. Another thing is that the rake sometimes doesn't get the clumps if your kitty tends to urinate in the same spot. Every day, I have to take the scooper and scrape the bottom of the pan to get everything up. I know it seems like I have a lot of complaints, but I really do like it.

His usual food is a &#34;surf & turf&#34; variety with duck, salmon, chicken, and some veggies.<br /><br />First mixed some of the new Nulo food with the old surf & turf.  He ate a few pieces of Nulo but seemed to be eating &#34;around&#34; it, going for his old food.  After a couple of days of this, I swapped out his old food for 100% Nulo.  Uh ... no.  He was NOT having it.  Really went out of his way to avoid it, cried pitifully in the kitchen for me to please come and feed him (he also gets a small amount of canned food each day).<br /><br />Still not sure what the problem is, except he really just didn't like the taste.  I tried for 3 days to get him to eat it, but he wouldn't touch it, and at his age, I don't want to stress him too much by withholding food just to get him to eat something he doesn't want.<br /><br />This is not to say that all cats will hate this -- the mixture of reviews here attests to that -- but for my guy, it didn't work.

I think I got it more for me than for my cats.  I should have gotten the pink flamingo too. But there are only so many cat scratchers/climbers we need (consoling myself for not springing for both, lol). The climber is small, but it is true to size in their product description measurements. It is easy to put together, and is even nicer quality, look, and feel than expected. So soft!<br /><br />My big gentle lab who loves his stuffies really wants to play with this. My cats aren't sure what to make of it yet. As with any new cat item directly from box, they are wary. I will need to douse it with cat nip to help lure them onto it. There is plenty of space on top for them to sit. The cubbyhole area is questionable. I have fat cats, I know they will fit, but I imagine it will be easier for a smaller or more slender cat to move around in it. The support poles inside are covered with same soft material, which I find impressive. The scratchers are small, so I wouldnt get this for the scratchers, but they do add visual interest, and who knows.. maybe they'll be used, especially the angled one.<br /><br />It is light weight, but fairly sturdy. I would prefer a wider base. On the plus side, the angled cat scratcher gives it additional stability. I wouldnt want to omit that item.<br /><br />OMG LMAO.. I just saw this in their product description: \"The cat tower with scratch post is perfect for naps, fur cleaning or uninterrupted sleep but also for playing, starring and judging your poor life choices\" Hahahahahahahahaha!!!!!  ok, THEY KNOW CATS (and cat lovers). Thanks for the chuckle, catry. Well done.<br /><br />The dinosaur tail has crinkles in it. I imagine that some cats may enjoy smacking that around a bit. If I were a kid, I would like this just to use for playing with little toys, dolls, etc. As of right now, I have it sitting next to a recliner, and the way it is positioned, I can use it as a mini table. I'll probably put it in a better spot for my 3 cats, but right now I like it situated next to the chair.<br /><br />I already have some Catry products that have held up over the years, and that good impression led me to getting this. Might have gotten it for myself more than my cats, but who knows. I imagine in the right location and after a few more days (I just put this together) they will like it. My house has lots and lots of fun cat stuff and this is another fun additon. I personally like it. Easy assembly.<br /><br />I'll add some pics soon<br /><br />5 stars.. its delightful",

I actually ordered this for my cat thinking he would be able to stretch into an extra small but this is too small for him as he is 10 pounds.

Ball is life for Natalie. Unfortunately, there is one huge problem with this thing. The motion sensor on the front stops the launch of each ball until it's clear. That sounds like a great safety feature, except the darn thing is way too sensitive and the distance set is too far out.<br /><br />The unit launches the first ball. Dog runs to snatch it. Dog drops the ball near the machine and waits for the next launch. And waits. And waits. And waits. Dog gives up and goes away. Machine launches the second ball and dog is no longer in the area or interested. This happens because the motion sensor trips at 10 feet away and closer even when the dog is to the side of the machine rather than directly in front of it. Additionally, the balls are tiny so if you have a big dog, these could easily present a choking hazard.",

            "question": "title: tolerated well by my lab w/ lymphoma, but not really sure if it made an impact, worth trying\ntext: Worth the try. I am sure some folks are here because their sweet baby was diagnosed with some form of cancer and learned about Turkey Tail mushroom extract as a great fighter of cancer. Others may be here as a preventative, or as a preventative for their surviving babies after one passed. The following info is less about the product and more about our total experience. The short of it is that my girl liked this, tolerated it very well, and I gave it to her for the duration of her terminal cancer. She was diagnosed on the 18th of Janurary, we started this on the 24th. She passed yesterday February 27th<br /><br />I bought this as a reaction to learning about my sweet 7 years old English yellow lab being diagnosed with lymphoma. She was always healthy, always spry. I didnt expect her to develop an aggressive, terminal cancer. With great consideration, we went the route of palliative care with high dose prednisone. We knew it may not provide a lot of time, but the time we have should be good, no stress, and she'd be at home doing all the things we are used to. No added complications from more intense chemo options (but that is fine if you choose that route. We all have decisions to make and consider). We loved and adored as usual. Really nothing changed for her.<br /><br />I added in additional supplements, with this Vet Smart formula being the foundation of it all. I liked that it includes other supplements that are often mentioned in articles. I decided to use this day and night, as well as top it off with an extra dose of turkey tail mushroom (another product).<br /><br />She did really well the first two weeks on the high dose prednisone and this supplement. She had no problem eating this mixed in with food. It smells good. Has a lightly meaty aroma and I found it pleasant. So did she. When the prednisone dose was dropped down, within a week her lymph nodes swelled back up. We went back to the high dose, and other than continued comfort (and added desire to eat), her nodes continued to swell all over. Her stomach was greatly distended.<br /><br />We checked her quality of life frequently. We knew we werent going to keep her going for us. Our duty as a loving care giver is to be able to make that choice for THEM not us, as hard as it is. We decided which portions of her life created our Molly, and if those areas diminished, then we know that her quality of life diminished. Does she eat, does she play, does she snuggle, does she play with her lab brother, does she go for her special stuffy, does she get happy to see mommy/daddy/grandma, and so on.<br /><br />Truthfully, it was hard to tell. But a couple of things indicated that she was simply getting tired. Could tell that she wanted to do all the things, but she was just wearing out. Her cancer was using up all her resources despite all the good quality food and supplements. She let us know, and we made an appointment with Lap of Love. We told her about it, and even told her how many hours (it would be 36 until appt). The day before the appt, she really perked up. Quite a bit of energy and loved seeing a couple of family member visits. It was a great day, great night, and we had that momentary thought-- is it too soon? But hubs and I both remembered that it is better a week early than a day late.  But come morning- the morning of the in home appt-- she didnt want to to get up. She seemed to be sleeping. But she was awake and aware but not shifting position at all. We stayed at her side, verbally loving on her, not touching her much as we werent sure if any of the nodes were pressing on parts that are uncomfortable. she seemed to be checking out, so to speak.  Thankful that the vet would be coming and thankful that our little girl really confirmed for us that she was done. She seemed comfortable (non pained) and was just such a sweet brave girl. When vet arrived, my little girl wagged her tail. Nothing else moved, but she wagged her tail. She could make eye contact with us, and I knew she knew we were all there with her and for her. Passing was peaceful. We did right by her.<br /><br />------->>>So, if you read this far, I would just say.. go ahead and give this a try but know that it may not make a difference. Some cancers may respond, some not at all. I know it didnt hurt her any, but not sure if it helped any. At no point did I decide not to use it. In fact I went through about 2 bottles worth, using it morning and evening, 2 scoops at a time. It's pricy but the additional supplements beyond one type of mushroom appealed to me, and I bought/used a separate high quality turkey tail mushroom supplement in addition to this. Dont go broke if you cant afford this. It may not be the fix you hope for.<br /><br /> I personally am a huge fan of mushroom supplementation as use products similar to this for my own use. Due to all the stress of the past 6 weeks or so (and going forward with my loss of my soul girl) I am doing what I can to support my own nutritional needs.",

One reason I like the canned food is that it has so much moisture.  I wouldn't call it dry, but it's not as wet and moist as most canned cat foods.  It's a pate and as far as canned cat food goes, it doesn't look very appetizing. I have offered it to my cats several times. They seem interested, but I haven't seen them eat more than a few licks or bites. However, on one occasion, someone's bowl was completely empty. But most of the time, I end up throwing it out. The list of ingredients looks good. I will continue to offer it to my cats from time to time.",

The bag is filled with pieces, of all different sizes, which contrasts to other dog treats, many of which try to stay consistent in size and shape from one treat to the next. I like the way Wag treats are sized differently because I can assess how large of a piece I think my dog should get and find an appropriate size.<br /><br />These dog treats are slightly chewier than others, but only a little. It still won‚Äôt take your dog long to eat them- mine finished his off in under a minute.

The oldest one has gone crazy over this! She attacks, jumps, and chases it for several minutes at a time. It has been so fun watching her.

Given that she is a super picky eater, I was thrilled to see her immediately smell and continue to chow down.

I got this for one of my cats because he repeatedly gets sick and steps in his vomit. This helps clean his paws. I use a little bit of Dawn with warm water and then put one paw at a time in the chamber while turning it back and forth. The silicone bristles help cleanse the paw. The instructions are on the box but photos would be good too.<br /><br />I dry this by pulling off the top and removing the silicone as shown in my photos.<br />What is unique about this one compared to some other silicone paw cleaners is that it has a silicone brush on top. The top pulls off instead of having to be screwed off. It also comes with a lanyard that is a bit hard to \"install.\"<br /><br />The current price of $12.50 is reasonable for this. Note that this comes with a cheap blue cloth--it is not premium as described. I first saw these types of paw cleaners at Duluth Trading Company in New Jersey and was impressed; however, the price there is over $21, so this is still a better deal. If a pet will not tolerate this, then no matter how good this is it will be useless. I already¬†gave a few of these to my neighbor's and one neighbor says her¬†dog loves this.

We've been trying some different foods recently, and I try to give each new variety a fair trial, introducing it slowly into their feeders.  Mine are \"grazers,\" meaning I can leave food out all the time and they don't overeat.<br /><br />From the looks of things, they aren't wild about this, but they are eating it.  Nutritionally, it seems well balanced.  My cats have had problems in the past with wheat and corn, so I tend to offer them grain-free varieties.  This Tuna, Barley and Peas isn't grain free, but after 10 days on it, I haven't noticed any of the problems I've had with other grains (they get an almost hive-like rash -- not fun for them or me).  The bits are smallish, which suits them fine as well.<br /><br />Hills is a high-end brand, and their products are generally high quality.  This seems to be no different.  It's a tad pricey, but for the quality, that's probably fair.  I may try one of the other flavor combinations of this and see how it goes, and certainly keep this on my list of \"rotating\" foods for variety.",

It's been several days and the smell is still pretty strong. It is doing a good job of covering the urine smell. I do really like the clumping that this does. It's the best clumping litter we've ever had. I am super impressed with that feature. This clumps better than the corn one, but in my opinion the corn litter smells better.  I'm noticing about the same amount of litter being tracked outside of the box. Oh, and none of my cats had any difficulties changing to this litter. That was pretty smooth.

            "question": "title: Much Better Than Traditional Litter Boxes!\ntext: We have two cats and have two standard litter boxes in the basement. A few months ago, our female cat started using the main floor dining room and an upstairs  bedroom as alternatives. I didn't want to deal with litter being tracked around so I searched and searched for the perfect litter box. The Tidy Cats Breeze system isn't perfect, but it's much better than the standard litter boxes. The first Breeze system was put in the master bathroom upstairs. There are some pellets that stick to their feet and get tracked onto the bathroom tile. However, it's much easier to deal with than traditional litter. I just pick it up and toss it back into the box. I rotate the pad in the drawer after 3 or 4 days and replace it about once a week. I scoop the solid waste every few days. I am really impressed with how little it smells. I have had the original pellets in the box for about 6 weeks without any issues. I did add some more to it after a few weeks just because I have two cats using it, but I have not disposed any yet. This box has eliminated the problems we were having upstairs completely. The female cat was still doing her business in the dining room. Last week I ordered a second box for the main floor of the house. So now we have the two regular boxes in the basement (which they are still using) and then one Breeze system upstairs and another one on the main floor of the house. I am very pleased with how they work.",

My dog can be quite gassy and frequently her stomach/insides make loud gurgling noises that are a bit disruptive. This supplement is very easy to use. I just give her morning food three sprays. There's no odor and she eats her food without any problems. The H20 PRO contains 70 million CFUs which is well over the minimum of 20 million that the article suggested. So far, it seems to be working well. I haven't noticed any gurgling stomach noises or gassiness since she's been taking this.

We have one cat bed set up in a hallway and one of them loves to sleep there. The other was sleeping on the couch at night until we presented this bed to her and she has slept every night since on this bed.<br /><br />This is more of a dog's bed, based on the design of the bed and accompaniments. It is a rectangular bed with a trough entrance in the front. The sides are plush and soft but the removable cushion that serves as the base is very soft and puffy ‚Äì ideal for a larger spoiled cat. There is a large bone-shaped pillow that is attached to the bed on the inside that would make an interesting chew for a dog or possibly a pillow, but our cat does not seem to notice it.<br /><br />I have the medium-sized bed and it seems about right for a small- to medium-sized breed of dog like a border collie or for a larger cat. It is slightly bigger than my cat needs but it is not big enough for both of our cats to comfortably sit together in it.<br /><br />I have looked over this bed and I have found no issues with loose threads, uneven stitching or blemished materials.<br /><br />The bed is fairly easy to wash too. The cushion comes out and is about the size of a standard pillow and its cover can be washed. The bed cover comes off and it can go in the wash (I recommend a gentle cycle). If using it for cats, most of the time it is easier and faster to just go over it very thoroughly with a vacuum cleaner to get all of the cat hair.<br /><br />This bed has worked out very well for us and especially for our cat. Since placing this on the floor for our cat to find, she has slept in it every night without exception, and that's high praise coming from her. If you have a pet that you want to spoil, either a dog or a cat, this is a good way to spoil them.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

That was a deal breaker and it is being returned. It consists of :<br /><br />* Rectangular frame for the seat part.. BEWARE : make sure you install the folding hinge in the middle, so that the frame folds upwards, not down... otherwise it will collapse when your cat jumps onto it. Also, the frame has a thin metal bar that runs across the middle of the bed. This sticks up considerably in the middle of the bed and makes an uncomfortable bump. My senior cat hated it, and would not stay in a stretched out position. He left the seat after 10 minutes and never got back in... he practically lived in his old one.<br /><br />* 2 metal legs to support the frame on the bottom: we had trouble with these staying in the slots at the edges of the frame.... once it was put onto the window, the leg on one side kept drifting out. There is nothing to lock or hold the legs into place on the frame.<br /><br />* Cushiony polyester seat cushion: BEWARE: this cushion has a strip of velcro at the edges of the 4 sides, so that you can install it by wrapping it around the 4 metal bars of the frame. There is only 1 piece of velcro... so this has to stick to the fabric alone, which is not a very secure hold on neoprene-like polyester. This is the only way to secure the fabric seat part onto the frame, unless you do what another reviewer did, and sew it together once it is on the frame.<br /><br />* 4 suction cups: these worked pretty well for the few hours that we tested it out. I am not sure if they would stay on long term",

            "question": "title: My cats run from this & my friend's three dogs avoid it; but it might be good for some dogs\ntext: [[VIDEOID:c99fcbfb372801140c9f9ce4c2a79fb0]] I've updated my rating from 2 to 3 stars and revised my review below to include both the response from three cats and three dogs.<br /><br />---REVIEW---<br /><br />I got this for my cats but all three of them run from it and will not eat the treats dispensed. Also, the treats are just spilled out all over the place making a mess. It sort of gyrates around as can be seen in the video even when there are no obstacles in the way.  Therefore, my three cats rate this a complete zero.<br /><br />I then tried this on my friend's dogs. They also avoid it but they wait until it is almost out of the way before they eat the treats or kibble I put inside. Most of the time this dispenser goes in circles or gyrates in place. Only rarely did it move along on a straight line. The dogs also seemed to find it as more of an annoyance than a pleasure.<br /><br />ABOUT THE PRODUCT<br />This is an auto rolling treat dispenser but is not for heavy chewers. It takes 4 AAA batteries (not included). A Phillips-head screwdriver is needed to open the battery compartment. The wheels kept moving as I was unscrewing the cover so I found it a bit tricky to remove the screw to the battery compartment. The treats get inserted into the hollowed out wheels. When one wheel is full, I had to cover the full wheel with my hand so the treats would not fall out while I filled the other wheel. From that perspective, it is a bit cumbersome. Once the switch is turned on, the treats spill out due to the movement.<br /><br />This is nicely made and the wheels rotate well in my hands.  Dirt and hair do get stuck or picked up by the rubberized wheels and tip.<br /><br />In summary, since my friend's dogs were not as skittish with this RoboBone as my cats were, I do feel that some dogs might enjoy this--especially the rambunctious ones. However, based on the results I got, it is obviously not a hit with all dogs and definitely not with cats.",

After wetting his fur we rub TropiClean into the fur around his eyes  and beard and allow it to sit for 3 minutes as directed, then wipe it off and rinse the fur with water.

That means it is necessary to have assorted treats on hand at all times and while most dog treats have questionable ingredients, there are lots of quality brands and treats on the market, they just require an investment of time to find them. One good treat I just discovered is the Portland Pet Food Company Combo Pack - Human Grade.<br /><br />When this combo pack, you get a bag of dog biscuits and a pouch of soft food. I have purchased countless bags of dog treats from different companies, but I think this is the first time I‚Äôve seen one that was sold as a combo pack. The soft food is beef and rice and it makes for a good topper on my dog‚Äôs regular food. Any soft dog food containing beef is going to be a hit with my dogs and they absolutely love this as a food topper.<br /><br />The dry treats were my main motivation for trying this dog treat. I find them particularly good overall. They are small treats and are not going to last more than a few seconds, but they have their usefulness as a quick reward. And most important of all, these treats and the soft food are high in quality, free from artificial ingredients.<br /><br />Dogs need to be rewarded and while it may be tempting to go with less expensive, store bought dog treats, it makes more sense to invest in a little more money and feed your dog treats that are high in quality.  The Portland Pet Food Company Combo Pack - Human Grade is a high-quality treat manufactured in the USA by a company that donates part of the proceeds from these treats to animal shelters and related programs. It is an excellent product overall and one I am proud to serve to my dogs.",

The treat compartment is located on one side and the bag compartment on the other. Note that no bags are supplied; one must supply their own.<br /><br />The clip hooks on to my small leash but will not hook onto my large leash. Either the lease has to have a metal ring on it or the leash handle must be tiny enough to get this to hook on. I personally think this was designed to be paired with a specific leash. There is Velcro between the top and bottom compartments that will allow me to cinch this around the large leash but the bag does not stay up when set up this way. Of course, if one is wearing jeans or walking around with a purse, it can be clipped on there. Other than this, this works great.<br /><br />Overall, this is super attractive and functional. The current price of $12.93 is  a bit pricey, however.",

I needed something easier to move around besides an obnoxious, large and heavy metal crate- so, I chose zonetech portable play pen which has done its job quite well.. (*this does replace kennel purpose just gives an is it move alternative!)<br /><br />This is a ‚Äúpop and go‚Äù set up- open it up and playpen unfolds right in front of you.. BooM!! This weighs nothing as, it‚Äôs light as can be.. almost a bit too light! See photos included.. the material is see-through which makes me a bit hesitant for its longevity.. but, so far no issues with rip/tear.<br /><br />All sides including top are ventilated and even transparent. For a pup who must keep eye contact to ‚Äúfeel safe‚Äù this has it covered. Speaking of covered.. if needing the polar opposite effect on sight- throw a light blanket over the hexagon top. This sturdy enough structure allows for a covered kennel!<br /><br />Zippers can be a bit fragile so careful.. ours actually arrived off the runner- but, backing it up and starting the process over corrected issue.. whew! So far they‚Äôve held nicely even while containing the pup.. and interestingly enough, he seems subdued while enclosed?! Hey, I‚Äôll take it.<br /><br />Ive got mid size SUV and actually placed this in back completely set up.. I did this so car stays free of animal hair.. **a huge perk for dogs with wirey hair that is impossible to remove from car seats otherwise!!!<br /><br />Only angst: folding this back to put into the tiny carry case- it folds flat to the thin and long level- but try as I might.. I cant get that folded in half?? After 25min. of trying I stored this outside the case- Bummer! To clean: this does superb with a Lysol wipe of material.. one can wet material if need just let it air dry completely when done-<br /><br />For $25 it meets a few unique but, important needs and if you fit this category I would suggest giving it a try.. hoping this info can help your decision- stay safe.",

Otherwise, it pours cleanly.  That's a good sign.<br /><br />It clumps better than any I've used in the past, even some that were more expensive.  This means that the clumps stay \"suspended\" rather than forming on the bottom of the box.  Another good sign.<br /><br />It controls odor better than any others, even without perfumes.  Seriously, there is NO odor at all.<br /><br />Finally, my cats have allergies to some ingredients in other litters, especially any with scents.  They have shown NO signs of allergies to this litter.  None at all.  They actually do a better job of covering since they're not in a rush to leave the box due to irritants in other litters.<br /><br />I'm going to try to keep this stocked at home.  A word about pricing: pay close attention, as the price varies wildly depending on seller, phase fo the moon, alignment of the planets, who knows.  I paid just under nineteen dollars for my last 28-lb box; it's now going for just under thirty-five bucks from the same seller.  I check periodically and buy when the price drops.  The 28-lb box does last awhile -- it's equivalent to 37 lbs of \"regular\" litter, and it does seem to work out that way.<br /><br />Definitely happy with this.",

Eukanuba Adult Hearty Stew with Beef and Vegetables in Gravy is exactly that- a soft dog food that is loaded with real meat and certain to get any dog‚Äôs attention.<br /><br />Wet dog foods are loved by dogs and this food from Eukanuba is much like other canned dog foods in that respect. Even if my dog is in another part of the house, he will quickly come running if I open a can of dog food. A dog‚Äôs extraordinary sense of smell picks up on the fragrant aroma of meat and soft dog food sends my dog running to the dinner table with tail wagging. My dog loves the taste of this food and eats with abandon when it‚Äôs served to him.<br /><br />Just like with other wet dog foods, I tend to limit this canned dog food and serve as a topper to regular, dry food. I serve it as a treat more than a regular food and the reason is largely due to the ingredients. I like that meat comprises the top ingredients and Eukanuba should be commended for added a good dose of nutrition to this food. However, there are some by- products and a scattering of other questionable additives. It‚Äôs still a notch better than some of the cheaper brands of canned dog food but some of the ingredients could concern the more attentive and demanding dog parent.<br /><br />Eukanuba is a generally trusted brand and its Adult Hearty Stew with Beef and Vegetables in Gravy is a good choice in wet dog foods. You won‚Äôt have any problem getting your dog excited about this and if you can get past some of the less desirable ingredients, you should find this a good canned dog food option.",

I ended up with the exact same results. By bag #4 I *finally* got decent results and unburnt snacks that I felt okay with my dogs eating. In my trial and error, I discovered that I can only microwave these bags for 22 seconds without the snacks burning. The bag is still slightly black but the treats are good.

However, since they are biodegradable, there's actually a 2-year shelf life for these bags even though it doesn't say that on the box.<br /><br />The current price of $13.99 is pricey for these bags as it comes to $.12 cents per bag when most bags sell for between $.04 to $.09 cents per bag depending on the bulk size purchased. I would not order these again because of the squat size, narrow opening, and tiny finger holes for handles.",

            "question": "title: Sammy loved them\ntext: Our dog, Sammy, recently passed on. Before that he was on medication for kidney problems. I don't know how he did it, but we'd give him the tablet and it would appear that he ate it. But later we'd find it in one of our shoes (I guess he was telling us what he thought of those pills!). I heard about this product and decided to try it. He LOVED it! If he noticed the pill, it didn't matter. He still took it. Finally he didn't need the meds anymore, but he loved them so much that they made for great training treats. So I put them on the subscribe and save list. It was nice knowing that I wouldn't forget to get them.<br /><br />As I said, Sammy has passed on (He was 15) and we cancelled the S&S subscription (I don't think we'll get another dog. Losing him hurt too much). But I wanted to review it because I want people to know just how great this product is.<br /><br />The only downside is that they are pretty greasy. But, at least for us, it was worth the hassle of wiping our hands off afterwards to know that our dog was getting his meds and was enjoying a special treat. They come in chicken, hickory, peanut butter and some allergy thing. Lots to choose from.<br /><br />The only suggestion I'd give the manufacturer is to provide a variety pack of different ones. Or Amazon sets up bundles consisting of different flavors, instead of selling only one flavor in a set, such as this one. I worried that Sammy might get tired of the one flavor and would quit eating it. He'd done that in the past with other treats so, even though it didn't happen this time, I still worried that it would eventually. It's so hard to find treats dogs like that when we do we want to give them as long as we can. Providing different flavors helps spread that enjoyment time a lot longer. Just a thought.",

There are some rough edges on some of the routing and I did file off some rough edges on the slots where the food comes out.

Our cats used that all the time and even our shepherd mix would stick his face<br />through the archway and rub his side face on it!<br /><br />We lost that one in a move to another state.  So, we ended up buying one of these.<br />It is the same basic design, but the quality of the materials is vastly different.<br />The bristles are much farther apart, and can easily just poke the cat rather than brush it.<br /><br />The platform on the bottom is super thin with some plastic rather than wood.<br />It doesn't seem to tip over much, but then again, that is hard to determine when your cats don't<br />care for it!<br /><br />We have tried loading it with their favorite catnip (it comes with a tiny packet of nip), both in the<br />piece of carpet on the bottom as well as through the bristles.<br />Nope.<br />Neither cat cares a bit about this toy!  One adores to be brushed, so it isn't that they don't want<br />the touch - they don't like the spiney bristles on this item. We've also tried attaching toys, making it<br />the &#34;entrance&#34; to their favorite bed, nothing.  They avoid it like the plague.<br /><br />So, not sure if this item will really be something your cat would like.<br />In my humble opinion, they need to use a better bristle that is more condensed so it doesn't feel<br />so sharp to the cats.

I've tried different dry cat foods over the years (no cat should NEED moist food - don't be suckered in by your cat), but this is the ONLY one that produces a low-odor poop. It's actually pretty amazing. I have to remember to dump the cat pans because there is basically no poop smell, but some urine smell. Lesson learned: it doesn't matter how much smellem is in your litter, the poop is still going to smell. Masking it with fancy litter just does not work. I just wanted to share my experience. Try it and you will be amazed at the difference. AND, your cats will love it --- even if you have already spoiled them with the moist. You can mix at first, then gradually get rid of the stinky moist or dry food.",

We then got a chance to get a reviewer product of the small and we jumped at it because we liked the larger product so much.  The panels are wonderfully modular and work well as a finished rectangular kennel, but for us, it also worked perfectly as a reconfigured wall.  The panels are nicely finished with black, they have been maintenance free for us, sturdy and aesthetically pleasing.<br /><br />This small kennel is definitely small, 4' x 4' and fence high.  The canvas roof is nice and should hold up to most weather, although I would be concerned with constant sun beating on it.  We have used it to separate individual chickens during introductions to the flock and it has worked wonderfully.  I love the flexibility and portability and we are very happy with it.  Looks great!",

It was easy to assemble - less than 5 minutes from box to floor, ready to use - and the ability to quickly and easily change the eating/drinking height of the bowls is useful.

They love them and it satisfies their need to scratch.  A few weeks ago, my vacuum cleaner-which supposedly doesn't clog...did just that. It got clogged from all of the small cardboard cat scratcher pieces I vacuumed.  I was almost tempted to trash the scratcher,  cross my fingers and hope they would use the cat scratcher on their cat tower which located at the opposite end of the house . In light of new furniture for our home that will soon arrive, I decided it was better 'safe than sorry'. I DID ditch the cardboard scratcher...the moment their Lahas scratching pad arrived! Miss Piggy and Squeaky took to it immediately.  Minutes after I put it down, they checked it out and began to scratch away.  They've been using it ever since. Its well made. Its so well made, you can't see where they scratched!  I found no loose threads or holes.  The mat is a good size-15.7*23.6\".  Doesn't take up much room yet still a great size for my 2 cats.  Thank goodness for the anti-slip bottom...love that I won't have to continuously put it back where it belongs because it doesn't slip.  And I don't have to vacuum up cardboard any longer!  Thanks to the Lahas scratcher, I'm no longer concerned about the cats scratching the new furniture.  This mat is definitely giftable.  Makes for a nice holiday /new home/new furniture gift.  I find the price to be more than reasonable...and it sure is cheaper than having to replace furniture or carpet! Definitely recommended...a MUST HAVE for cat owners!",

All three dogs liked¬†the kibble. As you can see, they (see photo of one dog) are spoiled by being hand fed.<br /><br />The food itself is medium, pale, and round and less appetizing (less solid looking) than other dog¬†foods they normally¬†eat. This is made in the U.S.A. but the ingredients are sourced from all around the world EXCEPT from China.<br /><br />The human-grade ingredients are good except for the lentils. potatoes, and peas (see note). The first 17 ingredients are chicken, potatoes, peas, lentils, chicken liver, carrots, ground flaxseed, eggs, coconut oil, broccoli, pumpkin, apples, natural chicken flavor, chia seed, salmon oil, kale, minerals, etc.<br /><br />Note that unless a dog has a grain allergy, it is not a good idea to feed them grain-free foods exclusively. The reason is that vets are finding an association between heart disease (such as canine dilated cardiomyopathy) and grain-free dog foods. This disease is mostly associated with the foods that have peas, lentils, other legumes or potatoes as their main ingredients and this food has lentils, peas, and potatoes. Nevertheless, I feel it is okay to feed this food to a dog only to supplement a dog's diet and not as an exclusive meal.<br /><br />The bag has a sandwich bag type closure to ensure the kibble stays fresh.<br /><br />There¬†is no¬†price listed but I would expect it to sell for between $13.99 and $15.99 for 4 pounds which¬†is a typical¬†price. This is a decent supplemental food as long as the dog eats it but I would not exclusively feed grain free.¬† ¬†¬†",

            "question": "title: Ideal Additional Safety For Evening Walks\ntext: This is a review of the red LED collar. The product description and box both say this is can be (carefully) cut to size so it can better fit your pet. I honestly wonder about cutting off more than the last inch or so where there are no LEDs. I'd worry that cutting out an LED to get this to fit a smaller toy size dog or cat might damage the electronics as there's a tape marker on the tubing that shows what appears to be as much (about 1.5 inches) as you can remove.<br />Luckily the dog this was obtained for is large and fluffy enough that no cutting was needed. The dog likes to go for walks at dusk along a large canal behind the houses. People drive ATVs, quads and even large trucks along this area as well so being lit up as the sun goes down is a good safety feature.<br />The unit comes with a semi-standard mini-USB charging cable unlike the majority of devices that rely on micro-USB charging plugs. The cover for the charging area has a rubber 'blade' that fits into the charging plug. It took a few tries at first to seal the plug properly. It does comes with the proper charging cable just be careful with it if you have nothing else that uses this size plug. Luckily I do have other mini-USB chargeable devices so I have extra cables around. This odd size charging plug and the two permanent kinks the plastic tubing that this is made from are the reasons I can't give this a full five-stars. Still the whole unit is incredibly light weight and even though the battery is quite small they claim a run time of three hours. I managed almost two and a half switching modes (fast strobe, slow strobe and continuously lit). Recharge time is stated at approximately an hour and a half (half the claimed maximum run time) and I found that to be accurate. It's definitely a solid four-star item.<br />The light doesn't affect the dog we have wearing it. It can be seen, especially in one of the two strobe settings, from quite a distance away which adds to the safety of those evening walks. Please do remember, even for the smallest of pet this should never be used as a lead. Use a safe, strong collar or body harness to attach your leash to.<br />I received this item in exchange for my review.",

Note that the charging port is on the bottom and the ON/OFF \"PIN\" is next to it.  Once the red light that I could see through the case went out, I knew it was ready to use.  All I had to do was press the power button on the bottom. Since the button is a PIN it is not totally easy to depress.

I do wish the on/off button was more intuitive and easier to depress, however.<br /><br />The current price of $12.99 is competitive.

            "question": "title: This is Easily The BEST Carpet Cleaner...EVER!!!!!!!!\ntext: A few months ago, I had the absolute pleasure of testing and reviewing Rejuvenate Carpet Cleaner and I was simply amazed.  It took care of stains immediately. Since then, I've used it MANY times on the carpet with perfect results each and every time.  Last week, our dog got sick in my husband's work at home office. Though I used Rejuvenate Carpet Cleaner (regular carpet cleaner on pet stains), the stains came out immediately.  I realized the bottle was getting low so I went to order another. When I saw the 2 pack of Rejuvenate Carpet and Upholstery Pet Stain Remover and that it can be used to tackle not only pet stains but grass, chocolate, mud and more, I didn't hesitate and placed my order.  The bottles arrived packaged very well and protected-neither opened/no leaks.  (And they arrived 2 days early!  What a great surprise!) I wish I could tell you I haven't had to use Rejuvenate Pet Stain formula yet but alas, I cannot. Around 3:00 a.m. , I awoke to the sound every cat owner dreads...the sound of our cat throwing up...on the bedroom carpet. ( I will try to word this so I don't gross anyone out . ) I went and got the bottle of Rejuvenate Pet Stain spray and returned to the bedroom. I didn't have to search for the stains, found them right away. 2 spots, both dark in color, both liquid and nothing solid. I was so tired, I sprayed the Rejuvenate on both stains and put a damn cloth over each and went back to bed. This is how the instructions on the bottle advise to handle tough stains if they don't come out initially after using Rejuvenate.  The instructions advise to spray the cleaner, let it penetrate for 15 minutes and try to wipe up. I skipped that step due to being tired and just sprayed the cleaner, covered it and went to bed. When I awoke nearly 7 hours later (I slept in!) and checked the stains, both were GONE!  Just like that. As though they'd never been there to begin with! I'm telling you, you can't even see the stains faintly, they are GONE! ( At 3:00 a.m. it didn't occur to me to take photos of the stains for my review...my apologies)<br /><br />Rejuvenate isn't limited to carpet use. It can be used on: furniture, clothing, flooring and, as the bottle states, 'anywhere stains happen'. I've only used the pet formula on the carpet so far. I HAVE used the regular Rejuvenate Carpet Cleaner spray on our sofa and a curtain. The cleaner removed both stains (one was iced tea, the other chocolate milk) immediately and didn't damage or discolor the sofa or curtain.  The pet formula eliminates pet odors as well though I cannot comment on that as I haven't had to use it for that purpose...yet. The pet formula bottle IS compatible with a Click n Clean mop, however, I've not used it in conjunction with a Click n Clean, so I cannot comment based on experience.<br /><br />I'm beyond thrilled with both Rejuvenate Carpet Cleaning (regular) spray AND pet formula. I actually did a live chat with a Rejuvenate employee a few days ago, asking if Rejuvenate makes a shampoo for carpet cleaners. They do not, unfortunately (Rejuvenate, if you're reading this, I BEG YOU to make a carpet shampoo for carpet cleaners! ) but I'm incredibly thankful for the carpet cleaning sprays. They work and they work FAST and VERY VERY VERY WELL!  The prices cannot be beat. As I prepared to buy this 2 pack of pet sprays, I braced myself for what I assumed would be a fairly expensive charge on the credit card. I was FLOORED when I saw the cost for 2-32oz bottles!  Although we have 2 cats and a dog, these bottles will last a LONG TIME.  Just a few pumps on the trigger is enough to take care of stains...doesn't take a lot of product to tackle and remove stains. I cannot stress how wonderful this cleaner is.  It really is amazing and I ABSOLUTELY recommend it. Its a MUST-HAVE for pet owners! But don't forget...the pet formula can be used on MANY other types of stains as well!<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",

Aussies Shepherd mix loves her walks and eagerly gets excited whenever we go out. I tend to use an expanding leash when we walk (to allow her some room) and I found myself with her regular leash and collar pulling her back whenever she would go to fast for me. I know that 'yanking' is not great for her neck and I had been looking for a harness I can use instead. This Amazon Basics fits her perfectly. It is lightweight, hugs her body and prevents that yanking. It took her about two or three days to get used to the harness, but now I wouldn't go back to her standard collar. It is easy to fit on her and it's a breeze for her and I now when we are walking. I highly recommend this brand (and I know it is reasonably priced when compared to other harnesses on the market today).",

I never paid attention to the design on the filter (6 squares or 2 squares). However, I ordered this [[ASIN:B071J2B3YR 12-pack of filters]] and received 12 separate filters in a plastic covering. I did not realize that the ones with the 6 squares were knock offs and complete garbage causing the water to foam and foul with black mold within a few days.<br /><br />However, these filters come in a 3-pack and have the 2 squares on them which are as pictured on the PetSafe website. These are definitely the original OEM filters. My cats' water no longer fouls and I have been using the same filter for a couple of weeks now. I would never order the other filters again.",

Benefits - very reasonably priced, very sturdy, bungee cord makes it almost impossible for the dog to pull you down as you have time to react, if any kind of medical emergency should happen to you while walking (i.e. stroke, heart attack, fainting episode) then your best friend will be tethered to you and lastly, it frees up both your hands in case you would need to defend your dog or self from an attack or take an emergency phone call. I'm sure there's others I'm forgetting but I think you get the point. Cons -  I know the description reads the waist belt extends to 50 inches, but I believe it's between 46 and 48 inches at most.

The dogs love them and have no trouble digesting them. However, I am going to limit treating with Busy Bones for the following reason: I have discovered that they are INCREDIBLY HIGH IN CALORIES.<br /><br />Each busy bone in this (smaller) size contains slightly more than 300 calories. To put that into perspective, note that a dog who &#34;should&#34; weigh 20 pounds must consume no more than 500 calories per day (if only moderately active). In addition, veterinary groups say that generally treats should comprise no more than 10% of a dog's daily caloric intake.<br /><br />My terrier mix should weigh 20 pounds but currently weighs about 23.5, and my vet has cautioned me to help him lose weight. While the dog food companies don't make it easy to determine how caloric their products are, and while there is no law compelling them to publish calorie counts for treats (starting in 2015, however, they will be legally required to provide such information for regular dog food), there are online resources (mainly the websites of some big veterinary practices and independent labs) that provide this information for some of the more popular treats and food.<br /><br />I was shocked to learn from my internet research that Busy Bones are among the most caloric dry-type chew treats out there. While this might be an appropriate treat for a very large and highly active dog, it clear to me now that it was a terrible choice for my chubby, lazy little guy.

However, since they are compostable, there's usually a 2-year shelf life for bags like these but there is nothing saying so on the package.<br /><br />The current price of $14.39 ($17.99 minus 20%) comes to $.08 cents per bag.",

Once this is done you are ready to go-<br /><br />Attach to any standard width countertop or furniture ledge.. this is held and connected by a clamp method, easy open = turn left.. easy tighten = turn right. Once secure let fishing arm dangle the string with toy feather, butterfly, etc.. you can even attach something you have at home- as long as it‚Äôs light enough in weight!<br /><br />From there.. this does just what you think it would. It releases the string any vibrating motion going down (helps to bounce item around and get/hold cats attention..) then, as quick as they begin to bat and play with.. it retracts and winds the item back up! Cruel and unusual.. probably!!? But, for a bored cat this can provide plenty of amusement.<br /><br />Motor is NOT silent.. this is one issue some may have. Although not obnoxiously loud- this has the start and stop continuously that can become a little annoying. Personally, one can drowned out with TV or music- if you‚Äôre not sensitive to noises.

Going by the measurements in the product description I chose the xs but I knew it would be a 50/50 proposition between the xs and the s size. Alas I chose wrong and the xs was just a little too small. The return was painless. The seller issued a return code almost immediately and the funds refunded similarly. Now full disclosure: we didn‚Äôt ‚Äúuse‚Äù this item. We didn‚Äôt need to put 5 miles on it to know it didn‚Äôt fit quite right. We ordered the next size up before the return was completed. From the sellers perspective I‚Äôm sure this helped them in deciding that ours was a legit return. Bottom line this isn‚Äôt a custom made item like other ‚Äúprosthetics‚Äù and braces are, but it is constructed the same way with a sturdy molded plastic. I‚Äôd suggest buying a roll of vetrap to help in tweaking the fit and keeping it snug. This item is appropriately priced but remember you my have to get creative because IT‚ÄôS NOT CUSTOM MADE FOR YOUR PUP. Be prepared to use your head.

There's plenty of them, so it's not a problem.  I gave a couple to two of my neighbors and their dogs absolutely love them.  When I first ordered them, I was concerned that the spikes might hurt her mouth, but they absolutely do not.  I was also concerned whether they would be big enough for her to play fetch with safely (she's a 62 lb. Pitbull, so her mouth is pretty big), but they're a perfect size for her.

She is a very calm dog that I knew would not swallow these bones whole. At first she plays with them and then she eats them. Since she has plastic bones that are toys, she did not know what to do with these originally. Now she ABSOLUTELY loves these chews but so far there is no noticeable difference in her breathe or teeth.<br /><br />Although Violet loves these, I feel it is doggy junk food due to the ingredients. The first nine ingredients are (see second photo for full list):<br />- tapioca starch<br />- pea starch<br />- wheat gluten<br />- glycerin<br />- gelatin<br />- chick pea flour<br />- natural flavor<br />- citric acid<br />- potassium sorbate<br />- etc.<br /><br />At the current price of $34.99 this is expensive as it comes to about $1.25 per chew and there are 28 chews per bag. However, I believe if the dog loves these, then it is worth the price as an occasional purchase. As for the oral health benefits, that is still unseen in Violet's case.<br /><br />UPDATE June 17, 2019 -  Violet still loves these chews but there is no discernible difference in her breath or teeth cleanliness.<br /><br />UPDATE June 26, 2019 - Violet finished these and, although she loves these bones, it did nothing to improve or enhance her oral health. These are just good junk food treats that some dogs love and that is the only reason I am keeping this at four stars. However, it is 1 star with regard to the oral health claims.",

After revisiting the vet, she decided to lower the dosage to half of a pill once a day (great, now I've got to get a pill splitter or use scissors and cut each one in half, not a huge sacrifice but still kind of a pain).  I first decided to try cutting them in half with scissors and while scissors did work, the pill got kind of crumbly and made a mess.  I then decided to test my strength and wouldn't you know, they are SUPER EASY to break in half just using my hands. Now each morning I get my wake up call to give my girl her \"treat\"!  Yeah Pala-Tech!!  P.S.  I tried one and they taste awful :)",

My dog is an extreme chewer and manages to destroy all squeaky and noisy toys just about immediately. I think she takes great pride in it, Lol.  This one has held up though and she absolutely loves it.  It's big enough so that it's impossible to really clamp down it fully.  So far it's held up really great and she absolutely loves it. The noises are fantastic.  It's especially good in a larger space where she can run after it and the moving and squeaking is at a maximum.<br />Update - It's about a month later and the toy is still going strong.  It's still making the giggle sounds and there isn't any physical damage to the toy.  She has it all the time (I don't have to supervise it) and we play with it together every day.  She still loves it.  She had one of the green ones before, but she destroyed it.  I'm not sure why this one is better (maybe the different size or shape?), but it is definitely better for aggressive chewers.  I did order another one, assuming that she would eventually kill it, but it's holding up great.  I'm very happy with it.  If you have a really aggressive chewer like mine, this is definitely worth getting.",

She gets only high quality dry dog food.  She's had her teeth cleaned and I &#34;brush&#34; her teeth.  So the reason for her really awful breath is not readily apparent to the vet.

If you're used to $200 training collars then yeah, it's gonna feel cheap... but overall I thought the build quality was quite good for the price. I like that it has 3 separate buttons for beep, vibrate, and shock, as I've used collars in the past where you had to push one button repeatedly to switch thigh the \"modes\" and it wasted time and made accidents way more likely. The backlighting of the screen is a nice touch for dark. It seems like you have to re-pair the collar and remote each time you turn it on (maybe I'm doing something wrong?) which is easy to do, but also easy to forget to do and then obviously the collar won't work. The beep is very quiet which is good if you're training multiple dogs I suppose, but I've also used that function in the past to locate my dog, which you couldn't do with this collar. Adjusting the shock/vibration stregnth is a little fiddly but you get used to it.<br /><br />So far it's worked consistently and well, and I'm pleased with it for the price point and would buy again.",

However, the more he uses it, the more comfortable he becomes with it.

You have to pinch both sides and pull them up while lifting to open the gate. It's not easy. I fumble with the stupid thing all the time - I'm hoping that means that the little one won't figure it out either. All in all, this gate has worked well for us. One quirk (besides the hard latch) is that when you close the gate you have to push down to lock it into place, else you can just lift the gate and it will open again without having to use the special lever mechanism.

            "question": "title: Not for shorter/smaller dogs\ntext: As expected, our new corgi puppy was bouncing all over the truck and I wanted to keep him more contained. I will say that yes, I do have a crate for him to use during longer drives, but when I am going to the post office or grocery store which are within 20 miles from home, I let my dogs ride loose in the truck. They're cattle dogs and we live in an extremely rural area (southern Wyoming) so I don't have any traffic to worry about so it's mostly no crates for us, except for the young pups who lack self control. LOL!<br /><br />So I ordered this doggy seat belt to keep Booker contained in the front seat. Just as I did with my 6 yr old corgi when he was a pup, I planned to wrapped a bungee cord around the front passenger seat and clip this seat belt to it. That allows him to have free movement but limits him to the front seat only. Well.. that would work if this seat belt wasn't so long or if it could be shortened. It has some room for adjustment, but very little. Certainly not enough to keep a corgi pup in the seat I have assigned for him.<br /><br />I had my bungee cord setup all assembled in the front passenger seat and clipped this doggy seat belt to Booker's harness. The clips are very well made! They are thick, sturdy metal that I'd imagine could take being run over by a Mack truck and still work just fine.<br /><br />That all said, I cannot recommend this doggy seat belt for small dogs. I had Booker situated in his seat and all buckled in and we went to the grocery store. When I came out of the store and opened the truck door to put my milk and sugar in the back seat (it was a very short grocery run), I saw my puppy dangling between the front seats, hanging over and behind the center console! I quickly jumped in and took care of him but that was the last time I used this product.<br /><br />Forgive me for having no pictures (I was kind of preoccupied with saving my puppy at the time) but what happened is this... my corgi puppy tried to jump from the front passenger seat to the rear bench seat but this doggy seat belt stopped him about half way, and the elastic bungee portion of the strap probably jerked him backwards. Now.. if he was a larger dog he would have been left standing on the rear floor. But.. corgi's have very short legs and corgi puppies have even shorter legs, so Booker was left dangling with the doggie seat belt stretched out over my truck's center console where his feet were suspended in midair and nothing nearby to give him purchase to pull himself back up.<br /><br />Bottom line... I do not fault this product for this incident. Booker is fine. The belt was clipped to the D-ring on the back of his harness, so he was not being strangled or hung by his neck. From my experience though, I will certainly suggest that this doggy seat belt only be clipped and used on dog harnesses - not collars! I will also strongly recommend to only use this with larger, or rather taller, dogs.",

            "question": "title: Buy this! Perfect for food motivated fur babes! Perfect combo of snuffle & licky style mats!!!\ntext: [[VIDEOID:dcdec4e25b95398671964077588b8608]] I hemmed and hawed on this. Then I went for it. I got it today and immediately put it to use.<br /><br />I have fabric snuffle mats and I have silicone licky mats, and this is like a combo of each. What a great idea! SO GLAD I bought it!<br /><br />My 7 years old lab was recently diagnosed with lymphoma (it's terminal) and we dont have much time with her. Every day of her life has been good, and an absolute pleasure in min3, and will continue to be as long as she is feeling well. Taking it day by day. Nothing has really changed for her except she has a huge appetite (prednisone). I have been giving her extra mini meals throughout the day and will often utilize a snuffle mat, licky mat or kong to extend her pleasure. Give her something to focus on longer than what she would normally just scarf down. This works!<br /><br />I really didnt think I needed this, but once I got it in hand, it was exactly what I needed (on various levels. Sorry to get sappy. I just loved seeing my sweet perfect girls face light up when I showed her this).<br /><br />I loaded it up with the usual assortment of goodies. I smeared some wet pate all over and under the leaves, I sprinkles an assortment of kibble, as well as some healthy treats. I tucked away some blueberries and added in some stinky baltic spratz (dried whole mini fish). There is a lot of surface area to work with. It isn't limited to the base. Make use of the top side of the leaves as well as underside if using something sticky. The leaves are situated in such a way that food can be dropped onto the leaves. Kind of a shallow cup.<br /><br />She watched in interest as I compiled this for her. Her nose sniffing the air in anticipation. Then I called my husband out to watch her with her new mat. She was eager to comply with cues such as (sit, paw, wait). She was really motivated (normally she thinks those cues are lame, haha)!  He set it on the ground so I could get pictures (which I will include).<br /><br />She worked on it for a long time, several minutes for sure. She was so focused and happy. She licked and snuffled and sometimes picked the mat off the floor to shake out some treats. She truly enjoyed this and it was novel enough that she seemed to get worn out (in a good way) from working this mat. She took a nice snooze afterward.<br /><br />Her brother isnt much into food unless necessary (and he's a lab! how can this be? haha), so I am not sure if he will use it after her time to go to Rainbow bridge comes. We also have a couple of cats, and I am pretty sure one of them would use this. We'll see. I dont want to offer it to them yet. Right now it totally belongs to my baby girl.<br /><br />When I came to review this, I noticed that the product listing has this on sale. I decided to go ahead and buy another because I want to give one to my friend who has a dog that needs to be on extremely low key activity for a few weeks. I think this will make a nice little gift. I'll add in a can of pate and some heathy treats for them to get started with. Little things like this can really help impact a dogs psyche. It is mental stimulation and it is also soothing, and therefor satisfying. So a doggo on bedrest may appreciate this!<br /><br />As with any dog, supervision is a must. My girl isnt into destroying anything, ever, nor would she eat the actual mat-- but your doggo might! So just keep an eye on them.<br /><br />The suction cups aren't great, but i didnt buy it for that. They also dont impede just placing this on the floor or rug.<br /><br />I noticed that I could get some suction when I pressed it down on my counter top, but it wasnt a strong suction. Maybe it would work better if a little damp or in a tub? Yet a more traditional style licky mat may work better for that if wanting to secure it to a wall.<br /><br />I totally think this is worth it. It made our day, and I will be using it again tomorrow. And hopefully many more tomorrows after that.",

Mostly, I worry about his back. Being a longer dog, corgis are more apt for back problems than most other breeds. I really appreciate how these multivitamins cover so many bases: digestive system, hips, joints & bones, skin & coat, urinary tract, immune system, respiratory system, muscular system, cardiovascular system, nervous system and special organs (like eyes).<br /><br />The bag contains 60 multivitamins so giving him one each night as his bedtime treat, this bag will last us 2 months. The resealable zipper topped bag is most appreciated, helping to ensure they stay fresh and last the 2 months. These must taste good as Skip takes them with no issue or hesitation. We have seen no ill effects such as diarrhea or vomiting or any other issues.<br /><br />Overall, I am very pleased with these multivitamins and will continue to purchase them!",

I brush my long-haired cats, then retract the bristles with the button. The hair remains on top and can be slid off. It is a cinch to use.<br /><br />Also, the tines on this brush are not as soft as several others I tried and the surface area of the brush is decently sized. As can be seen, I brushed one of my cats hard and got some of their hair (see photo) and the tines barely bent.<br /><br />Note that this is for long-haired pets only; I would not use this with a pet with short hair.<br /><br />In summary, this one's tines are stronger than other brushes I tried but will still bend. The surface area of the brush is a good size and I love the bumble bee design. I definitely like this brush but the current price of 16.99 is expensive as the exact same brush (but with a \"wiuwiuwiu\" logo on it) can currently be purchased for $9.99 [[ASIN:B09MQ193H2 here]].

I am pleasantly surprised that the stitching is reflective and the orange color also enhances visibility.<br /><br />This leash is very short at 20\" from tip to tip. The foam handle makes it easier to hold a grip and prevents the leash from cutting into hands.  I did have terrible trouble with the locking snap hook, however. It took me about five minutes to figure this out. Once I did, it was easy to master.  All that is necessary to release the locking mechanism is to pull down on the top of the lock toward the base of the leash. To re-lock push the lock up back toward the hook. Picture two shows the lock closed and picture three shows it open. I also attached a video demonstration.<br /><br />Overall, this is a sturdy, comfortable, reflective short leash with a good locking mechanism that is great for when more control is needed on dog walks.",

As I started to purchase plants and decorative items for the tank I was purchasing them based on the dimensions that are given on here to my surprise the tank is not as large as they say that it is and it does not hold 5 gallons of water even without rock in there. The actual dimensions of the tank portion without the lid and without vase are 10 inches high  X 13 1/2 inches wide X 6.5‚Äù sides without bow, going to 10‚Äù at the very front of the bow.  Another thing that I found very helpful was reading through all of the questions and comments and finding one that told me how to quiet this filter down. They do not tell you that you have to fill the water all the way to the base of the filter which completely submerses it.  Even then it does still make a slight grinding noise but much better having added the extra half inch of water to it that I was lacking. I do still wish that it had been the correct size that they say which is 15 x 15 1/2 x 10 essentially I would love to have been able to put a few things or a little bit taller in the tank.  Just so that you know the highest that you really should put in there is about 9 to 9 1/2 inches anything else than that will be above the water line. And one last thing for me anyways the where the water flows onto this flat filter only about half of the filter actually gets used, And my tank is level. Overall I guess they just really need a better filter.  I thought this tank because I like the way that it looks, however I am wishing now that I had bought one of the panoramic, tall round, or the 6 1/2 gallon tank or even go out to a 10 gallon tank, so that I could‚Äôve had a few more fish because I‚Äôm not one to just have a single Beita in a 5 gallon tank or in this case it‚Äôs actually about 4 gallons even without rock.",

To top it all off- I need this for a Pug- a breed known for needing to mark their territory.. ugh! And the real cherry on top- we just had puppy neutered and so he‚Äôs a few days postop!<br />Let‚Äôs just say- I‚Äôve been on cleanup patrol and I‚Äôm losing the battle..<br /><br />Looking for any solution I found disposable wraps... that mimic a doggy diaper?! I noticed the difference in the fact, this has flashdry product- so,<br />It may help us with leaks or accidents..<br />Perks:<br />‚Ä¢ these are clearly marked  so, you know your putting it on correctly. When wrestling a dog who‚Äôs not in the mood to play baby diaper this is helpful! Or, if you‚Äôve accidentally put it on wrong and find out the hard way (by leakage!) then, you know how important the directional wording is!!<br />‚Ä¢adjustable legs are helpful in closing off the gaps that naturally occur.<br />‚Ä¢urine is absorbed into a gel like substance when it occurs- This drastically decreases leakage and helps to absorb liquid really well- flashdry is your friend!!<br /><br />‚Ä¢ These come in sizes that are chosen by measuring the dogs girth- which is a far better gauge of fit than using an overall weight measurement!<br />‚Ä¢The closure tabs do a far better job at working really hard to leave pups hair out of the closing equation.. *Keep in mind- you are wrapping an animal with fur- so, it‚Äôs not full proof.. but, this does help.<br /><br />Probs:<br />‚Ä¢These can still wiggle around- i‚Äôm not certain if that is the puppy, parent or products issue?! And may be a little combo of all three?!! But, as your pet runs and rolls around, these can find their way to slipping.<br />‚Ä¢When placing on puppy- it almost appears to be slipping off from the beginning.. nerve wracking for sure!<br /><br />‚Ä¢Needs a no bite bitter taste strip! If your puppy wants to try and chew this off- it would be helpful if this had the bitter flavor barrier!! Anything to deter them from wanting to bite and self remove!<br /><br />‚Ä¢These are absorbent for small accidents- but, I‚Äôve found that if puppy has full bladder.. the wrap can struggle to hold/contain the full amount. (Sure, I realize these arent made to be replace going potty outside-) but, a full bladder sometimes is a thing and if, so.. the wrap can leak.<br /><br />If weighing perks + probs together.. One can decide if their issue could be fixed and their needs met by what these can/can‚Äôt do.. for us, they helped a lot! **One solution I had for chewing on the wrap- Is to use the bitter flavor coban (medical adhesive wrap with a flavor deterrent) bandage strip and place this around the edge that‚Äôs closest to dogs mouth reach.. if, the taste gets into his mouth- Oh, he will stop trying to chew!!! Sure, this makes one more step and item needed to buy, but in the big picture it helps stop the chewing- and can also help tighten up any lose gaps on the fit itself.. Is this an obnoxious fix to the chew problem? Sure! But, it‚Äôs also a productive fix if, having the same issues we are!! And the fact, we are trying to heal + potty post an operation.. I won‚Äôt lie- we had this extra supply on hand which made this a feasible/doable option.<br /><br />Overall, these help to make things better vs. worse but, they‚Äôre not 100% potty training solutions and not meant to be! tbh, not sure anything is.. only, the sheer training of a puppy will ultimately fix things in our house- good luck to all! Cleaning puppy potty I know, is not high for fun on anyone‚Äôs to do list..!!!<br />I hope this info helps‚Ä¶ Feel free to let me know",

On my old pump I always had to detach the cord in the middle leaving a piece of cord behind (that was also attached to the wall plug) for my cats to play with until I cleaned the fountain and plugged it back in again.

There are 24 cans in this package. The first several ingredients are chicken, chicken liver, chicken broth, dried egg product, fish oil, etc. This is high in protein for kittens.<br /><br />I ordered this for my three elderly cats who need to put on some weight. One of my cats is so old (about 19 years) and thin that he needs to gain at least 7 pounds. Therefore, it is a good idea to use kitten food to beef up a cat's weight but only for those who need the calories. Otherwise cats should not eat kitten food because the excess calories will cause them to gain weight.<br /><br />Blue Buffalo is good food in my opinion. However, two of my cats would not eat this. My oldest cat would not even try it. My other skinny cat only licked it then walked away. Only my heaviest (of the skinny cats) ate about two-thirds of the can but it took him 12 hours to do so. I had to throw out the rest. This is going to get donated to a shelter with kittens.<br /><br />In summary, two of my cats' do not like this food and only one would begrudgingly eat some of it when that is all that was left. However, if one's cat needs to gain weight or a kitten likes this chicken food, then this is good food in my opinion.",

I will say it‚Äôs not ideal for larger house cats or for any animal much beyond 15 pounds. But, for animals in the right size range, it‚Äôs better than I expected.<br /><br />This is a small octagonal bed that comfortably seats one slightly overfed house cat (who am I fooling, that cat eats like a teenage football player). It‚Äôs very soft and the cushion inside is appealing to animals that like a soft, plush surface. The sides are also padded well so even against a wall the pet will have a plush surface on which to rest.<br /><br />The bottom is mostly non-slip and so far the bed has remained in place where we initially set it down.<br /><br />One of our cats has adopted the bed and she can often be found sleeping in it during the day (when she‚Äôs not asking to be fed). She‚Äôs about 15 pounds and she fills the whole bed but she does indeed completely fit in it. The cushion is still relatively new so it hasn‚Äôt mashed down much yet, but I expect as she sleeps in it more the pad will crush to a thinner but still soft pad.<br /><br />It has helped ease competition for sleeping spaces between our two cats which was the goal. I am pleased with it and so far they are too. It‚Äôs not a particularly expensive bed either and so far it‚Äôs holding up very well. For a smaller pet, this is a good choice.",

I really like this convenient packet feeding as well. Food remains fresh and there are no cans to have to open (or dispose of). The portion size of this is also perfect for a single meal feeding.",

Cat that is missing most of her teeth wants to chew on it but has finally figured out the scratching part.  Unfortunately, she is a large cat and when she pushes against it to scratch her cheek or chin, it starts to tip over and she backs away.  We're probably going to add a larger base so it is not as tippy.  Our cats are pretty aggressive when they need scratching and this arch should give them another place, other than our laps, to get a good scratch",

Also there was no handle included with this crate.

These are a bit chewy and they were not use to having to eat jerky treats like these. I normally feed them [[ASIN:B07D2W4T3K¬†Pup-Peroni Jerky Bites Tender Beef Dog Treats]] the dogs go crazy over. Nevertheless, these were a hit after they got use to them and one dog was begging for more.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />- organic chicken<br />- organic pea flour<br />- organic molasses<br />- Non-GMO coconut glycerine<br />- salt<br />- Non-GMO Natural Smoke Flavor<br />- organic apple cider vinegar<br />- canola oil<br />- mixed tocopherols (preservative)<br /><br />In summary, it seems dogs love these after getting up the nerve to take the first chewy bite. At the current price of $8.99 for a 4 ounce bag, these are expensive. I only rated these 4 stars because I personally do not like these as much as the other jerky treats I used to treat my friend's dogs and dogs in my neighborhood. Since these are chewy, dogs take a moment to take to these but they love them in the end.¬†",

I had a fish company ship me 2 Betta's by mistake - of course I only had one betta tank.  Had to find another 5 gallon tank before the fish arrived and I needed heaters for both.  I bought two of these 100 watt heaters.  They work quite well esp for the price - in fact I couldn't find any other heaters that were short enough to fit in their tanks (what is wrong with these sellers and their huge heaters?).  Even my heater for my 50 gallon tank barely stays below the water line.  So these work great for most/all 5 gallon tanks.  In my opinion a betta deserves that much room - don't make them live in less space regardless of what the bet store tells you- it is just cruel if you do. Betta's are one of the smartest fish, fill their tank with things to look at and do and pay attention to them every day or don't get one.",

However, I've used it for maybe a year or less even - and the Velcro is worn out. Yes, there is a safety strap that buckles closed on top of the Velcro closure, but that is not adequate, in my opinion. Almost every walk, after about 20 minutes, I notice the Velcro is just about completely separated and harness is slipping around because the only thing holding it on is the safety strap. I have an 80 pound pit bull, so I can't take chances with equipment that won't hold him on the rare occasion when a bunny or kitty cat crosses our path.

Because of their advanced years, two have a bit of urine leakage when they sleep. I don't mind....my girls have been awesome dogs and washing bedding every morning is the least I can do after so many years together.<br /><br />I use a waterproof pad on top of the super thick orthopedic dog beds and then a soft blanket on top of that for each senior dog bed. I wash and rotate those blankets and pads every single day, so I need them to be well made. This is just a single, huge rectangle pad. It has a sort of felt like top side- it's not felt, but that is what it reminds me of. It actually covers a big 48\" rectangle dog bed very nicely and it stays put through the night. So far, no urine has leaked through to the bed and that is all I ask. I've run it through the washer and dryer twice now and it hasn't shrunk or unraveled. I definitely needed to use fabric softener because the material isn't as soft as I would like.<br /><br />This set comes with two of those puppy feeder bowls. They have the food in a shallow space all around the bowl so puppies can do the moving circle to eat. The bowls are decent quality stainless. And there are tiny, puppy collars as well. Almost no one should be breeding for any reason at this point. However, since we foster dogs for the shelter here and sometimes puppy litters, these will eventually be used.",

The only issue is for outdoors they will get waterlogged from the elements. However, they do dry out and as I write this a new generation of kittens are enjoying these toys.

Typically, she is a picky eater, but she just loves this roasted chicken variety of Pedigree and will eat all of it. Of course, I am not thrilled with the fact that it says 'chicken flavored' and that 'meat' is the second ingredient (with corn meal being first). It is made in the USA and is supplemented with antioxidants and vitamins. Rating it as 4 stars only because my dog really likes this, but I prefer to give her more all natural varieties (where named meats are the first ingredients).<br />'",

However, no where in the description or offered pictures is the country of origin mentioned. I refuse to give my dogs ANYTHING edible from China and I try very hard to know where an edible item is from before I purchase it. Since the description offered no information, I turned to my fellow reviewers and saw pictures that these are from Brazil. Perfect! Well.. they arrived and while one side of my package looks like other reviewer photos and does indeed say \"Country of Origin: Brazil\".. the other side of my package says \"Imported from Turkey\". While this isn't a deal breaker for me, I would still appreciate knowing just exactly where the heck these rolls came from. I did decide to give them to my dogs and there were no incidents of stomach upset or bouts of diarrhea to report.. they were all smiles and butt wiggles (they're Pembroke Welsh Corgis, so no tail wags here LOL!). Overall, these treats seem to be okay but I thought I'd mention the dual countries of origin that are, oddly enough, both mentioned on the packaging for anyone else interested in knowing.",

I don't think she liked to urinate in the CL and sometimes wouldn't poop in it either. My hedgehog didn't use the Arm & Hammer stuff the first day or two but she does now.<br />It clumps so-so....nothing compared to the kitty litter I use for my cats, which is [[ASIN:B004IVETL8 SCOOP AWAY Multicat Complete Performance Cat Litter, 42-Pound]] (which, btw, is heavily perfumed but totally eliminates or covers up the smell of cats, and it is pretty dusty, but we like it anyway because it works so well and the cats aren't bothered by it). Anyway, the clumping of the A&H is okay if you're delicate with the scooping and don't shake it too much.<br />My hedgie does track it all over her cage but I change out her fleece cage liners every-other day anyway so it's not a big problem.<br />I haven't noticed that this litter is dusty at all, so that's a plus. Just have to make sure you don't throw it up in the air when you're scooping which is common sense.<br />Besides the fact that it doesn't scoop *that* well, the real reason why I'm giving it 3 stars is because it is really perfumed (but not as much as the Scoop Away). For them saying that it isn't perfumed on the bag, it really does smell strongly. I don't mind the smell--our spare bedroom where I keep my hedgie STUNK before I got this stuff, and now it doesn't stink and instead smells a bit perfumed from this stuff. *I* don't mind the smell at all, but I guess others might and especially someone with chemical sensitivity. I don't know what they put in it to make it smell that way, but it can't just be corn fibers and baking soda! It doesn't seem to bother my hedgehog so I won't be returning it, but I might debate on switching to something else in the near future anyway that isn't so perfumed.",
