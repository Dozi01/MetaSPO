            "question": "title: Fits in your hand, works with Fire Phone, loud volume, can accept & make calls through phone\ntext: I was very surprised at how powerful this little pod speaker actually is - it really does have a significant amount of volume and can be used in your car if you don't have a blue-tooth enabled system (for example my Mother's 10 year old Suburban out at the ranch) or at the barn when working horses in the round pen or dressage arena. It works via a standard blue-tooth connection or using the NFC option if your smart phone is equipped. There is also a microphone built in and the speaker does in fact, work very well with phone calls - we placed and received two calls using this as a speaker phone and the calls were a tad &#34;tinny&#34;, but if you need to speak to someone hands free while cooking a meal or grooming a horse and you don't want a traditional headset, this is an excellent option.<br /><br />I tested this speaker both inside and outside and it kept the signal from my Amazon Fire Phone almost 60 foot away outside in a direct line of sight with no degradation playing music. Inside the house, it managed to retain a strong signal through a closed door for about 30 feet before it lost the connection and that was far better performance than a no name blue tooth speaker we bought at Hastings in December. Sound quality is pretty good with both classical and country music. Pop can be a bit hollow at upper volume levels and hard rock has reasonable bass sound, but the vocals tend to become somewhat shrill to my ears. This is not a big deal in the least - just turn down the volume and know that at this price range you're buying the idea of portability rather than some super hi tech music snob gizmo.<br /><br />Connecting this TechMatte Sound Pod to my Amazon Fire phone was super easy & took literally 10 seconds via NFC. It also connected just as easily to a Samsung Galaxy S2 and a Samsung Galaxy Note 1st Generation. My one complaint is that the on/off switch is directly over the charging outlet, so you have to disconnect the charging cable to turn it on or off and then reconnect the cord if you need it to charge or want to power it via the outlet while in use. A minor irritant that is at most worth a half star deduction. Overall, this is a very nice portable speaker that does exactly what it claims to do and fits in the palm of your hand. I did receive a sample speaker to test and review.",

            "question": "title: Great battery life...little bit of a learning curve!\ntext: I bought the Samsung Chromebook with the idea in mind that it was even smaller than my laptop and would work great to read books on the go without having to drag along my kindle as well as my phone as well as...blah blah blah. Sometimes I honestly feel like all of my various devices turn me into a walking satellite receiver. The first thing I took note of when using the chromebook for the first time was how easy it was to set it up and make it personal. There is a handy one screen guide to walk you through the process. It is all pretty straight forward and if you are a user of google chrome, you pretty much have it in the bag already.<br /><br />I set up the chromebook and downloaded the apps I would need to use offline and found the process simple and satisfying. Typing on the chromebook is pretty much the same as on any other keyboard with the noted exception that the keys have somewhat large spaces between them which can cause my typing to be a little awkward since I am used to my laptop where the keys are all close together.<br /><br />The screen has beautiful even illumination and the apps download very quickly. It was a bit of a change to go from windows to the google operating system and took me a few days to organize things to where I could easily access them and remember where I put them.<br /><br />As for battery life, this thing rocks! I have used this thing for seven hours before and still had it estimate that I had over an hour left. Mostly I use the chromebook for business applications and perusing the web for my job so I have not had to much experience playing movies on it or listening to music. I don't do much with multimedia.<br /><br />So far it was a great purchase and I have been thrilled with it after a month of use. If you are looking for a lightweight, portable device to fill your basic needs, this is an excellent choice.",

It supports two Bluetooth connections as well as using the wireless dongle for a straight USB connection, and you can easily swap between them. I prefer the dongle because bluetooth won't wake up my computer when it goes to sleep (since BT also goes to sleep), and I can easily plug the dongle into something like a mini PC without having to get ANOTHER wired keyboard to pair it first.<br />Yet, it has a palm rest and split keys for ergonomic typing, plus the mouse is the taller bulb shape that fits in your hand better and feels like a substantial work tool. I'm used to only expensive wired ones feeling this good.<br />I have to admit, I'm out of practice typing ergonomically so I still sometimes try to hit the B key with my right hand, but that's on me.

            "question": "title: Extreme Speed Memory Card Requires Compatible SDXC Device\ntext: To use this SANDISK EXTREME UHS-I SDXC memory card the way it's intended (for advanced photography), you need an SDXC device (camera or camcorder).  You also need an SDXC device that's compatible with this new, latest SDXC format.  I was disappointed to learn that my older Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX2 camera, which is compatible with many SDXC memory cards, is NOT able to recognize and use this memory card.<br /><br />A word of warning:  If your SDXC or other device is incompatible with this SDXC card, the device may suggest that you format the card.  Do not do this!  Formatting will ruin the card as an SDXC card.  SDXC devices are backward compatible (and can accept SDXC, SD, or SDHC memory cards), but SDXC cards should be used only in SDXC devices.  (To learn more about the do's and don'ts of SDXC memory cards, you can Google \"SD Association Using SDXC memory cards\".)  If you have a Panasonic camera, you can find a list of cameras that are compatible with SDXC on the Panasonic web site.  Presumably other camera manufacturers' web sites have similar lists.<br /><br />Although this card doesn't work in my camera, it can be accessed with a USB reader or adapter that is SDXC-compatible; or through a WinXP, WinVista, or Win7  PC card reader slot, if the PC has the exFAT file system update (KB955704) that can be downloaded from the Microsoft Download Center.  My fairly recent Win7 PC (ASUS Essentio Series) is not compatible with the above file system update, but already had a driver that enabled it to access the SDXC card without formatting.",

            "question": "title: It's pretty good -\ntext: 3.5 STARS. I rounded up because it is more good then bad:<br />Bought as a Christmas gift for the boyfriend. We are long distance and we FaceTime a lot. Well, actually, I FaceTime with the underside of his kitchen cabinets, the blanket on his bed, the ceilings in all his rooms, or the top of his nightstand. He talks away, oblivious until I say something. It's funny mostly but sometimes in a relationship you need all the connection you can get, even if it's their face on your device while they smile or laugh or talk you through a bad moment. So, I got him this for Christmas so that he could hands-free me and I could still see his pretty face. He finally put it together and started using it the other day... with an asterisk. *THE INCLUDED SCREW/BOLT IS GARBAGE. It was machined badly. Really badly. So it only screws maybe halfway into the arm/neck or whatever it is called, which sits in the weighted base. Thankfully he really doesn't need the screw/bolt because the arm/neck (like a metal dowel, I suppose, that inserts into the base maybe half an inch. The screw/bolt is inserted from under the base and - if it fits correctly) recesses into the base when it's tightened. As this one had threads that weren't smooth about halfway down on the screw/bolt, it left the screw/bolt jutted out. The base won't sit on the nightstand or other flat surface with this issue unless he just doesn't use the screw/bolt. I'd post a photo for clarification but the stand isn't available and getting him to send photos isn't always something I remember when we do talk.<br /><br />The screw/bolt is I'm sure metric and it does use an Allen wrench (included) to screw in; the threading is very tight, so finding a true replacement screw/bolt is probably gonna require going to a specialty nuts/bolts/hardware store. That's annoying enough to take off 1.5 stars for me.",

I really like this camera because it's small and very easy to use. It makes very nice photos. This is a great camera for anyone that has not used a digital camera before. The menu is easy to navigate. The box also includes batteries, an adapter, a nylon handle, bag, memory card and user manual. I was prepared to go buy a separate memory card but was very happy to discover one is already in place. The batteries do not take long to charge. It's great that 2 are included so one can be charged ahead of an event for backup. I like to take this camera along when I take my dogs out for walks. I tend to leave my cell phone behind so I can relax. I am now taking many more photos of my pets and inspiring photos from nature. It's very nice and relaxing to be able to use a small camera and avoid the extra stress of messing with an interrupting phone. I find this is a good value for the camera and inclusions.

The Android is a Galaxy J7 Crown and on that phone I had put an outer casing to protect it (since the phone on its own is very thin). The Clamp for use with a phone was able to fit snugly over both, but it was very tight. I've since been contacted Ubeesize , voluntarily without my having contacted them, that they can provide a large clamp for the phone due to the phone casing. . Then tried seeing how it would work with a Canon T3i DLSR camera . As can be seen in the images , success! The portion that attaches to the bottom of camera has a nice little 'knob' for screwing in quite tightly (as does the mount for screwing the camera on). These little knobs could be easily missed. In other words,  all fit on 'Tight' in all ways and the legs are very flexible. Will be interested to see all this will come down out in the field, but inside, for common use so far, great. Only thing, I'm afraid I could lose the removable part (detachable base),  as it is very small (Make a mental note).\" UPDATE: A new , larger mount is available that swivels from 'Landscape' to \"Portrait' position without having to remove the camera mount, as it previously was.

            "question": "title: Very Good Dummy Cameras with Excellent Motion Activated Floodlights\ntext: I have been working with security camera products for over 20 years - over that time I have installed systems for businesses, corporations and individuals - from enormous multimillion dollar systems to single camera nursery monitors.  I’ve consulted on large projects and written about security vulnerabilities within networks for trade publications.<br /><br />This is a field I know well.  Over the years the technology has improved and become less and less expensive to produce.  It is now practical to install security systems that would have only previously been used in commercial settings in residential.  When I’m discussing systems with people who are not familiar with the breadth of this technology, especially those on a tight budget, I always recommend making use of quality dummy cameras in addition to the real cameras.<br /><br />To the casual observer, these dummy cameras look real - someone who is familiar with security cameras will easily pick it out as a dummy but for the vast majority of people this will not be the case.<br /><br />What really makes these dummy cameras stand out from others is the solar powered nighttime red light and bright 800 lumen motion activated floodlights.<br /><br />Any security camera configuration works best when each of the components works with the others to optimize performance.  By setting these cameras as an initial trigger the lights will provide illumination for the real security camera so it doesn’t have to rely on infra red.  By this product providing ample light the images the other security cameras in range capture will be far more crisp and clear.<br /><br />These lights are easy to install and adjust so that the solar panel can absorb maximum sunlight.  There are multiple adjustment points so the lights can be directed where most needed.<br /><br />As with any solar powered product, there are some good tips to know:<br /><br />* When placing each light make sure the panel is unobstructed from foliage so it can absorb the maximum energy from the daylight<br />* Every few months clean the solar panels with a moistened towel to remove any dirt or mildew - the panels tend to develop a film that diminishes their ability to absorb energy over time<br />* The rechargeable batteries that power these, and all solar lights, can typically be replaced without replacing the entire light.  I have not opened this unit to see what batteries it uses as my set has worked flawlessly for the last couple of months.  When the batteries no longer hold the solar charge I will attempt replacement.<br /><br />So far I have loved these dummy cameras with motion activated floodlights. I highly recommend the set.  It provides a deterrent both during the day and at night it will provide a bright light that can scare intruders away and provide better lighting for your other cameras.  If performance changes I will update my review to reflect that.",

And then to integrate Avatar items into responses is annoying as can be! No, I don't want to play all those games you are showing continuously. I've contacted Amazon and was told that they are paid ads and I cannot remove them or refuse them. So, I am no longer a fan because you see, I also have Google Nest in my home, and truth be told, they show my photo collection much sharper, the sound is better when playing music and I have found, much smarter when in need of information, and the best part... NO ADS! NO INTERRUPTIONS! NO TRYING TO SELL YOU ANYTHING. So you make your own choices, but Google also has a sense of humor and I am done with Echo Show...  Do you want to pay money to be inundated with Ads! Some every minute (see Jeopardy photos).  Amazon has lost all my respect as to how it respects its purchasers of their products!",

            "question": "title: Good GPS Unit with Outstanding Support Behind It\ntext: This is my third (and final) write-up on the Magellan RoadMate 2220-LM. I decided to rewrite my review again after making more discoveries regarding this unit, enough that my previous attempts at writing a review were no longer satisfactory. In a nutshell, this is actually a very decent GPS navigator with a generous feature set and a few minor quirks. One of this navigator's greatest strengths is the level of support they receive when a problem is reported.<br /><br />Up to this point I have used a TomTom Start as my primary navigator and my wife uses a Garmin Nuvi. Both of these units have their strengths and weaknesses, but both navigate well and do a good job of selecting routes. I have always been curious about Magellan GPS navigators so I was pleased to get the opportunity to do a side-by-side comparison with the Garmin and the TomTom.<br /><br />Right off the bat, the Magellan maps look a lot more simplistic and basic compared to the Garmin and TomTom maps. Where Garmin and TomTom have opted for more colorful and polished-looking road maps, Magellan uses much more simple graphics when it comes to the maps. At first I looked at the Magellan's maps with disappointment, but as I have used them I realized that there is an advantage with their approach. Because the maps show the roads as more basic, single-color and narrow pathways, the maps are actually less cluttered, making them easier to read.<br /><br />I ran into a serious issue with the Magellan when I was trying it out during the first few days. Navigation was reasonable but the position showed me at roughly 10 yards behind my actual location, regardless of the direction of travel. Unable to find a calibration option, I contacted technical support. I got very immediate assistance and was walked through a procedure that was supposed to reset the unit, and what it did was more of a hard reboot. After several emails back and forth my issue was resolved and the navigator now tracks accurately. I am very pleased with Magellan's support - highly professional and very eager to make things right.<br /><br />So, with the accuracy issue out of the way I mounted the Magellan next to the TomTom and the Garmin and went for a drive along a known route I frequently take. All three navigators tracked the same, though I observed something interesting regarding the Magellan. The Magellan marks position with a blue triangular icon and the others use a cartoony icon that can be selected from a palette of choices. With the Magellan, actual position is the top point of the triangle, but with Garmin and TomTom the position is the center of the icon. Even more interesting is that, because of the roads being represented as more narrow at all zoom levels, the Magellan is more likely to show slight inaccuracy while the others show the same location and appear more accurate due to the wider road representation.<br /><br />There are a number of features that the Garmin and TomTom have that the Magellan does NOT have, though these are more personal preference options more than functionality options. Magellan has one voice - period. If you do not like the Magellan voice the only option you have is to mute it. Also, there is no option for changing the icon that represents the current location, it will always be a blue triangle. Garmin and TomTom also have content communities for upgrades where Magellan does not.<br /><br />Of the three navigators, the Magellan has the very best mounting bracket and suction cup. Attaching it to the window is quick and easy and removing it is almost just as easy. Like any other mounting cup, it does not do so well when the window is very cold, so if mounted on a cold windshield it can suddenly let go and fall.<br /><br />For my particular car, the Magellan's car charger is all but useless, due to the size of the plug and the placement of the 12V outlet. That said, because the Magellan has a standard mini-USB plug it can be used with a typical USB cable and a 12V-to-USB adapter. This is the configuration I use and it has worked out well. I did notice that the Magellan does not necessarily charge completely when it is plugged in and operating simultaneously.<br /><br />Magellan's navigator offers four routing options: Shortest Distance, Fastest Route, Most Use of Freeways and finally Least Use of Freeways. These vary in usefulness, the first two being by far the most helpful to most people. When using Shortest or Fastest I have found the routing to be very sensible most of the time, though the routes usually differ just a little bit from what my TomTom offers up. I have not mapped out a route by hand to see which is more accurate but I believe them to be roughly equivalent.<br /><br />I decided to try &#34;Least Use of Freeways&#34; for a 45-mile one-way trip. The route offered up was reasonable but because of the traffic at that time of day I knew better than to take that specific route so I took another way. The Magellan then continuously told me to make a U-turn until I was probably 5 miles from the turn I skipped, after which it finally calculated a new route - way out of my way and making little sense. It recommended turns going farther from my destination, continuously trying to steer me back to whatever route it had chosen. I finally got on the freeway for a three-mile stretch, and it recommended I take the very first exit (west-bound) followed by a U-turn, when what I needed was the east-bound exit maybe 0.1 mile further down the interstate. After the exit, it tracked just fine. To make matters worse, every route after that seemed to have some quirky turns in it regardless of the method I chose for routing. I finally reset the unit using the suggestions that technical support had made earlier, after which the navigator has been just fine. Bottom-line: the Least Use of Freeways routing is not very good.<br /><br />Probably the biggest weakness of this navigator is the software used to interface with the unit. Content Manager, which can be downloaded directly from Magellan's website, is a rather unintelligent application that provides basic connectivity to the GPS unit, with a poor interface and the inability to recognize that an update was made already without requiring a relaunch of the software. It continuously tells me that there is a map update when it says I have the current version. Magellan could have done a much nicer job with the software.<br /><br />The actual interface on the navigator itself is very well thought-out and designed. It is very much icon-driven and it shows a little more polish and refinement than that of Garmin or TomTom. Hiding in this interface is a good amount of functionality - access to POI databases, traffic camera alerts, &#34;phantom&#34; alerts, navigation by landmark instead of by street name and many, many more features. Magellan got something important right with their interface - it is very uncluttered and clean, making it a lot less distracting while driving.<br /><br />One feature of which I was completely unaware revealed itself on my commute home one afternoon. My unit did not come with traffic alerts. When I reached the portion of my commute that requires access to the interstate, traffic came to an abrupt stop. Without prompting, an icon popped up on the Magellan screen, offering three alternative routes. I had no clue the Magellan would do that since I did not get traffic alerts, but the feature is very much welcome, regardless.<br /><br />The Magellan 2220-LM GPS navigator is a nice unit with a good feature set. It is different than Garmin and TomTom navigators and some of those differences really set it apart in good ways. Support is outstanding. The software used to interface with it is acceptable though could be better. I think this is a fine unit that will serve the owner well. If you're looking for a good, basic navigation system at a reasonable cost, this is a unit that is worth a look.",

            "question": "title: Case Fits iPad 2, Bluetooth Keyboard Works With iPad 2\ntext: This polyurethane Targus Versavu Keyboard Case is beautiful, with imitation-leather exterior and suede-like \"soft touch\" interior.  A hard shell (also with imitation-leather exterior) holds the iPad firmly in place, yet the iPad can be easily removed.  The shell is attached at the circular hole shown in the product photos; the hole allows the Apple logo to show through.  The shell rotates (with the iPad inserted) a full 360 degrees, so that the stand and keyboard can be used when the iPad is oriented either horizontally or vertically.<br /><br />The lightweight keyboard is about the same size as the keyboard on my Toshiba netbook.  The flat, non-contoured keys are reasonably comfortable to use.  The keyboard is surrounded by a raised edge, to prevent scratches or damage to the iPad screen.  The keyboard must be charged independently (using the included USB cable, attached to your computer).  The keyboard will give a low-charge warning at 15% power, and shut down at 10% power.<br /><br />This case (with cutouts for buttons, switches, rear camera, and charger plug) fits my iPad 2 perfectly, and the Bluetooth keyboard connects with my iPad 2.  I didn't expect it to work, because the iPad 2 is equipped with Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR technology, while the iPad 3 is equipped with Bluetooth 4.0 technology, and the product description says that the case requires an iPad 3.  The case does NOT have an automatic iPad Wake/Sleep switch that operates when you open the cover; however, the keyboard puts itself to sleep after 10 minutes of inactivity.<br /><br />I like this case and all of its features, but it's not the \"perfect\" iPad 2 case.  It adds weight and bulk, and apparently--judging from other reviewers' statements--the manufacturer recommends against using the case for anything but display (no carrying the case around in a backpack, tote, or bag).  Because the keyboard works well, I rate it at 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4 stars.",

            "question": "title: Player is great, software is garbage\ntext: I had an iPod 2GB Nano and wanted to get something with larger capacity.  I did some research and finally bought the Walkman.  I was around for the very first Sony Walkman casette tape player, so the idea of getting a Sony MP3 player was appealing.<br />After using it for over a month, I find it a great little device.  The battery life is amazing.  I charged it over two weeks ago and have used it on multiple three hour car rides.  I also had it hooked up to a speaker in my office and left it on for several hours and it stil has battery life.<br />It took me some time to get used to the navigation, but now I am fine with the difference between the Walkman and the iPod.  The sound quality is good and although the volume could be better, it is acceptable for my use.<br />The major problem I have with the unit is the software.  Sony included one of those mini disc's which loaded a couple of software programs on my computer.  The main program is one which allows you to drag and drop files from your computer to the player; however, it doesn't work.  I dragged a few tunes to see how it worked and then started dragging all the music.  The software kept accepting the tunes, but after it \"loaded\" for about 2 hours, I discovered it had only loaded the first set of tunes.  The rest, and the two hour wait, was for nothing.  The software also has a \"delete\" function, which also doesn't work.  It tells you that it delets items from the player, but they are still there.<br />So, I junked that software and decided to use the Windows Media Player.  This is ok, except that the Media Player has a very odd way to create playlists.  There are some round about ways to create the play list and I have finaly learned how to do it, but it took way too long compared to iTunes.  The other odd thing is that when you create a play list it has to be from tunes on your computer, not on the device.  Then when you sync the device to load the playlist, it may or may not put duplicate versions of the music on the device.  Sometimes it finds the songs on the device and sometimes it does not.  So, I ended up with multiple copies of some songs.  The device software is also pathetic.  It doesn't allow you to create playlists on the device, and as others have noted, there is no way to delete items from the device without using the software.<br />I finally just had the computer recognize the device as an external drive and was able to load songs and delete them with no probme.<br />Despite the isues, I still like the device better than my Nano.  For one thing it has an FM receiver, which works great.  Now that I have come to terms with the crappy software, it works great. So, if you are looking for an alternative to the iPod, this is a good option.  Just stay away from the software provided by Sony and you will be fine.",

Before ordering, check your camera body and locate the mic jack. Many point and shoots just use built-in mics. Most DSLRs should be fine. Just use the supplied cord with the little camera picture on it. The other cord is for phones and tablets. Yes, it does work with those.<br /><br />The only problem my husband had was looking through the viewfinder with his ever-present baseball cap on. The cap's bill bumped into the mic's fuzzy cover.

Having this device however means I don't need to record in the software and/or use it as a backup, as this will offload the recording directly to my SSD drive I have plugged into it!<br />I have an Atmos Ninja recorder I sometimes use as well, however it is picky about the source (if there's a splitter or adapter in the middle, it doesn't like it), whereas this seems to accept almost anything I throw at it so far. I like that. Also, the fact that it can bump all the way to 4K is pretty sweet too, as I can even use the original Sony A7S (which only recorded 1080 internally) as a full 4K recorder now! Cons are that it doesn't really have a display to tell you what's going on so you need to rely on the little LED colors to figure it out. Plugging a field monitor into the HDMI out helps, as you can see the output as well as the \"rec\" label on-screen.<br />NOTE: DO NOT use the output of this box as your stream or other devices in a chain, as the output is NOT a clean copy of the original! Imagine that this box is using your monitor/TV/output as its own screen, with its own overlays and all. One other reviewer mentioned that it appeared cropped on the output versus what his camera showed. That is acceptable with using this with a field monitor to keep tabs on what it is doing, however, if you wanted to go straight from this box to an OBS stream or projector for a wall at an event, you're going to see the overlays. It does NOT support clean HDMI out.<br />I intend to use it with an HDMI splitter as a backup stream, or with my A7S mark i as a 4K recorder, and for that it is perfect.",

After all this time, the industry still can’t make up its mind about how bluetooth works:<br />- Microsoft with their mouse and Sony with their controller that pair without the need of a code (which Android’s bluetooth stack doesn’t support).<br />- Mice and keyboards that will not reconnect after it wakes from sleep mode.<br />- To this day, bluetooth devices still can’t wake a computer from suspend state.<br />So when I get a simple bluetooth mouse for a good price, and it actually works as expected, I was happy.<br /><br />For my review, I’m comparing the Bornd mouse to the [[ASIN:B006428K7I Motorola 89519N Bluetooth Mouse]] which I got in a set that included the [[ASIN:B004L9MBH6 Motorola Wireless Keyboard for Motorola ATRIX and XOOM (Motorola Retail Packaging)]].<br /><br />With the Motorola mouse, its frequency somehow conflicts with the Motorola keyboard, resulting in sticky keys, as in “I’m having a good daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay”.  Conversely, the keyboard interferes with the mouse where the computer would actually lose connection with the mouse for a few seconds after typing, or lose connection completely.<br /><br />What I liked about the Bornd:<br />- Pairing was simple using the button at the bottom of the mouse.<br />- Operating distance is about 5 feet, but this may be because of my computer’s bluetooth antenna<br />- Takes a single AA battery which lasts over a month of moderate use (2 hours per day)<br />- Mouse movement is good.  No need to adjust mouse speed in the control panel.<br />- Accuracy is good.  Editing images using Pixlr.com, I’m able to select precisely the parts of the image I need.<br /><br />What gave me trouble with the Bornd:<br />- When you first put your hand on this mouse, you will not feel that it is very well built.  The plastic is completely smooth and the mouse wheel seems to rattle when you shake it.  I got used to it after a few minutes, though.<br />- The mouse reconnects with the computer most of the time, but sometimes it was necessary to turn the mouse off and on again after the computer reboots or if the computer was out of range for an extended period of time.<br />- Lately, I’ve been experiencing double-clicks when I click on the left mouse button once.  I’m usually able to fix this by getting angry and slamming the mouse down a couple of times.  This may indicate a build quality issue with this mouse.<br /><br />In my specific case, the Bournd did not interfere with my Motorola keyboard at all and it seems the sticky key occurs only when the batteries on the keyboard runs low.",

Well, more like the sound is terrible with some apps, like Netflix or Amazon Prime- where the volume is sometimes not able to go up enough to really hear it, and I have sound sensitive ears. So I bought this thinking that it could lend a boost to the sound. I was able to get it to work with the cable, and the DVD player (the two areas that really don't need help), but could not get it to function with the tv itself. I tried all options, and I am either missing something or it just doesn't work with the tv. So while that issue *may* be on my end alone, I will just rate it on the actual sound.<br /><br />The sound it produces is definitely a boost over what I am used to with the tv speakers. It doesn't have a dynamic sound, but it isn't flat either. Not directional, more in the front sound. Clean though.  I think it would be better for use with a phone, tablet, or even lap top- where you just need some clean volume. It is long, but it is sleek. It can be controlled from the unit, or with the remote. The remote is uncomplicated and makes sense it its layout.<br /><br />So while it ultimately isn't working (right now) for MY purpose (I aim to figure it out), it is a nice speaker, at a decent price point (I wouldn't got higher), and the options it provides is nice. Normally I go into mega detail on items like this, but there are already plenty of reviews that go over the specs nicely. So in short,<br /><br />-Long charge<br />-Easy blue tooth connectivity<br />-Comes with connectors<br />-comes with remote for volume, power, and switching between outputs<br />-easy to follow short instruction pamphlet<br />-TF card option<br />-USB<br />-AC adapter<br />-built in microphone (which I haven't used, and have no intention of using)<br />--slim, sleek design<br />--has great volume capacity, not super dynamic- but different ears will pick up different sounds. I am attuned to nuances, so I can tell that this speaker doesn't go there.. BUT I still recommend it, overall.<br /><br />I figure out anything else, or if I get it working for my needs, I will be back to update. I hope my little bit helped, even if it was just reinforcing the more detailed reviews. Take care, and enjoy your day :)<br /><br />EDIT!!!  Perfection!! OK, so I took one more try at trying to get the sound to work with Netflix & Prime. I was watching Captain America last night, and could barely hear it despite the volume turned way up. I realized that the last time I had tried to use this speaker for that, I may have had the tv volume down and of course it wouldn't pick up on sound. For cable, you want volume on tv down as it is running through cable box and you the sound to only come through this speaker. For roku, etc, you would just plug it into the headphone slot, and hence want the volume up. The addition of the speaker totally amplifies the sound AND it did a great job with the sound nuances of the movie. It didn't just add volume, it enhanced the overall sound. SO this really impressed me and I knew I had to come back to update my review. I already liked the speaker at 4 stars, but now I am really happy to have this in my life. It makes ALL the difference in our program watching as we typically use Netflix and Prime daily and it is frustrating that the volume is greatly reduced. Now it is better than ever. The sound is large and fills the room, and I can hear various other tones and bass within the movie- so I guess it depends on the source not just the speaker..",

            "question": "title: Excellent Internal USB Hub for Tower Systems\ntext: One of the issues with some tower cases is the placement of USB ports. Some of the newer cases have USB ports on the front but often these are USB 2.0. Even when there are 3.0 ports on the front of the case it seems there need to be one or two more. AVANTEK's 5.25\" drive bay USB add-on hub adds three USB ports as well as a 2.4A charging port.<br /><br />The hub has two internal plugs. One is for power and one is for the USB bus. Be sure that your case and motherboard can support USB 3.0 and has the proper plugs.<br /><br />Once installed, the three ports are immediately available to the operating system and they work like the other USB ports on the system. The USB speeds are best realized with something like a USB 3.0 storage device like an external hard drive, though USB 1.1 devices like mice and keyboards work just fine on this hub too.<br /><br />What makes this hub interesting is actually the 2.4A charging port. This is very convenient for charging a cell phone, a tablet or similar device. My chosen device for testing chargers is a Magellan Roadmate GPS navigator, which is an ornery device that will not charge when powered on unless using the car charger that came with it. I selected a high-speed USB cable and plugged in my navigator and it charged up quickly when powered off. However, the navigator slowly drained faster than it charged when powered on. This was expected though it was worth a shot.<br /><br />I am especially encouraged at how solid this device is - the ports are securely soldered to the PC board and the board itself is mounted on several posts to the frame which makes it much less likely to flex and ultimately break. I applied some direct pressure to the PC board (not a realistic scenario in use but a good test before installation) and the board really did not flex much at all.<br /><br />I can't find any real issues with this hub. It's a solidly built device, it mounts easily and once connected provides 3 USB ports and a charging port on the front of a computer tower case. It is reasonably priced too which makes it a very good buy.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.",

There is an HDMI cord, and a USB power cord. Depending on how you plan to power up, you can use the USB side, or you will need to supply your own wall adapter, or your own USB-C adapter.<br />I wanted a DVD player for our spare room tv. I was looking at plain DVD players, and wanted something on the small side as well as something I could use with another tv or computer. This came up as an option, and I decided to take my chance on it (initially thought it pricey for a mini DVD player--but if it worked, then it would have been a good purchase).<br /><br />It meets all my needs. I wanted it to have a display, and a remote. It has both. It is super easy to set up-- just plug in the two cords --HDMI from DVD player to TV/monitor and power cord (plug mini USB into DVD player, then plug USB into a USB port or wall adapter). DONE! There is a small front display to show track time. There is a power button, volume dial, pause/play, forward, reverse. So remote can be used or can make adjustments directly on unit. Headphone port. Comes with ear buds! Top load. Included a sturdy remote that comes with  batteries!<br /><br />Picture quality and response is spot on. No issues with sounds.

            "question": "title: No Bluetooth capability so without a computer you can't upload any music to it!\ntext: I have their regular bone conducting headset that you can use via Bluetooth to listen to music with your phone. So I thought this was an upgrade that lets you do that as well as upload 8GB worth of music so you don't have to have your phone with you at all times in order to listen to music, but I was wrong.<br /><br />This one will NOT connect to your phone via Bluetooth and I was rather upset about that since I wanted to use it that way as well. This leaves you basically with an MP3 player that is in your headset, which is nice, however since this headsets don't have a display, you can't really control the songs except press next song or previous song. It is not like you can connect it to your phone and control a playlist that way for example. That is a crappy non existent feature in my eyes. You are stuck with whatever playlist is on your MP3 player forever and ever until you change what songs you have on there, and let's face it, who does that? Who wants to constantly connect their MP3 player to their computer to upload new songs so the playlist changes? I listen to music at work nonstop so this would be an issue fast. In addition work no longer allows to use my work laptop to download files from, which includes my own music, so that leaves me with no means to do it since I stopped keeping a personal computer.<br /><br />They need to figure out a way to connect it via Bluetooth to your phone and use an app that allows you to control this headset, make playlists and select them and so forth.<br /><br />In regards to music quality, it is similar to the other one from this brand I have. The quality is what I expect from a bone conducting headset. You get pretty good music all considering you have surrounding noise interfering. The issue I had with their other headset, it died on me after about 2 months or so. Since right now I am struggling on getting music on this and am stuck with their demo stuff only, I can't give it more than just 2 stars. It is fairly comfortable but they need to figure out a better way to control it since there is no display like other MP3 players have. They have another one that is Bluetooth enabled so they have the technology already. Combine the 2 and make and app and fix it! Until then I can' recommend it as it is right now.",

I do not doubt the earlier reviewer who claimed that theirs did, but my experience was different.<br /><br />When I claimed in the title that this is a clever design I am comparing this one to other headrest mounted tablet holders. I have tested literally dozens of other models and all required that either you remove your tablet from any case you may be using, or you endure less than optimum grips of the mount will accommodate a case. This one is a case plus headrest mount.<br /><br />There are some trade-offs in this one's design. First, you can only mount your tablet in landscape mode. Since that is the mode I always use this is perfect for me. If you need a mount that will accommodate portrait mode, or you need to switch between the two, this is NOT the mount for you.<br /><br />Some physical details that I do like include the heavily padded case when you are using outside of vehicle back seats. While the holder into which you insert your iPad is not the hard plastic, snap in design that affords optimum protection, it does dampen and absorb some shock. The covers are thick and provide a great deal of protection. In fact, that feature is better than ninety-five percent of every case I have ever tried. The organizer is handy, and all of the cutouts and accesses are perfectly aligned to an iPad's camera and various buttons and ports.<br /><br />If you need a case that will function as both a case and headrest mount this one is worth considering - as long as you understand the limitations that I have cited.",

This is his first ever tablet - dragging the man into this century is like pulling an ox out of quicksand with a rubber band.  I needed a tablet that would be:  easy to use, back itself up, was big enough for his giant hands, light weight to use while in recovery, have access to all our photos in the cloud while he was in and out of the hospital and bed rest, and easy access to movies and the books already on his ancient Kindle Keyboard.

            "question": "title: Superb Display for Multimedia, Gaming…and Developers\ntext: Not all monitors are created equal.<br /><br />There is a huge assortment of monitors on the market from which to choose, and each one brings strengths and weaknesses to the table. Which monitor is a best-fit often is driven by cost, brightness, resolution, speed, power consumption… This particular flat-screen LED monitor by LG excels in most of these areas and a whole lot more. The catch is the price - $999 as I write this – but it’s worth every penny of this.<br /><br />The monitor arrived in a huge box (which should be fairly obvious) and when we opened the packaging we could not help but notice that it was very well packaged to minimize possible damage to the contents. Everything was packed in tightly so that nothing was able to shift in the box, which shows that LG put some thought in the packaging. This was a plus before we even plugged it in.<br /><br />I have a teenage son who is an online gamer so I selected his laptop computer as the testing ground for this monitor. This particular system is a Core i7-based system (reporting 8 cores, not just 4) with two video cards and running Windows 7, making it an ideal testbed for this monitor. We plugged everything in, connected the monitor to the computer through the HDMI interface and rebooted. The resolution is absolutely stunning – it came up at 3440x1440 without any manual intervention and we did not need to load up any special drivers. After using it at that resolution for a while we decided to scale it back to a lower resolution, to make images and text bigger.<br /><br />The image quality is fantastic. There are no dead pixels at all and everything is very bright, clear and visible. The main complaint my son has had with other monitors is the lack of brightness and the inability to see certain things due to the inability to brighten the image. With this monitor, all complaints have stopped.<br /><br />When gaming, my son has exclaimed about how much extra space he has in the virtual realm in which he plays and has seen a slight increase in the game speed. That is, his complaints regarding video lag have all but gone away.<br /><br />Set at the highest resolution there is a real advantage for software developers, particularly when wanting to see more “stuff” on one screen. When opening an IDE for development, opening multiple files in a side-by-side arrangement on a screen this size becomes very comfortable. It’s easy to see most files at line width and still have room for two or three more files in a row across. This is so much nicer than having two monitors that may or may not allow for moving open windows between them (depending on the system configuration).<br /><br />One very nice feature of this monitor is the built-in USB ports that allow one to connect devices behind the monitor, clearing up desk clutter in the process. That can be used as a USB hub of sorts, which frees up ports on the connected system. One surprise we got, though, was that as a connected USB device itself it steals the sound away from the main speakers and pipes them through its own (which are of good, but not great, quality). It was a little disconcerting when we tried to connect headphones to the system and the sound was still audible without the phones on. Once we figured this out it became a non-issue.<br /><br />So, I have one and only one issue with this monitor – it is actually too big to fit on my own desk. As a result, my son uses it all the time now as his desk can handle it.<br /><br />LG has designed and built a truly amazing monitor. It’s bright, has amazing resolution and is wide enough to replace two monitors and then some. It is expensive but it is unlikely that you’ll find a better monitor for less unless you really need something smaller.",

Just by looking at the straps is one indication.  The bag is not lightweight; it is very well-padded, keeps your equipment safe, and it is spacious inside, and if you do not have enough photo equipment to fill it, consider room for more stuff.  Therefore, I use it for more than a photobag, and including for the padded lap top pocket that provides easy access.  I have adjusted the Velcro adhesives for the many compartments, and what I like is the strength and durability of the Velcro adhesives.<br /><br />The Tamrac is geared to handle the outdoors, as the rain flap covers the zippers to keep out moisture.  It would be nice if it had a full rain cover, but it does not.  Fortunately, with material will be safe during a nice wet hike.<br /><br />The design of the straps is called Strap Accessory System, which means you can attach accessories to the strap with hooks/straps for secure and easy access.  The straps are thickly-padded as is the backside.<br /><br />I like the large clear mesh inside pockets that can hold a lot of odd stuff.  Two large pockets hold enough small things without getting cluttered.  Also, for easy access are the two side wing pockets, great for holding the smaller things.<br /><br />This is considered a mid-size bag, great just to store your equipment, and keep it ready for longer shooting locations.  The external dimensions are  12 ¾ wide  10 deep x 16 high.  It weighs just over 4 pounds.  And just like most quality bags, there are straps to securely hold a tripod.  The zippers are dual sided.<br /><br />Again, this an attractive, durable, well-made photo backpack.  You will be sporting style when using this backpack.  ....Rizzo",

I discarded my [[ASIN:B00N9P8GMW Lumo Lift]] after a week or so, because my sitting posture is pretty good, and I rarely slouched badly enough to trigger the Lumo Lift.  In contrast, the Upright buzzes me whenever I start to relax my posture even partway to a full slouch.<br /><br />The Upright needs to be pasted to your back with gentle adhesive pads (60 included), rather than pinned to your clothing (like the Lumo Lift), but the greater sensitivity makes the extra effort worthwhile. Packets of one-time-use adhesive pads are available from the Upright web site for about $15.<br /><br />You can wear the Upright between your shoulder blades if you're going to be standing, walking, and sitting; or at the small of your back if you're an Upright novice or generally sitting.  As long as it's turned on, the Upright works even without the accompanying app (Android or iOS) that tracks your training progress.  The Upright app uses Bluetooth to connect with the wearable Upright.<br /><br />The app walks you through the simple setup, which mostly involves (1) finding the proper spot for placement on your back, and (2) calibrating the device so that it can detect a slouch.  Once it's calibrated, the device will gently buzz you whenever you sink into a slouch--which inevitably happens as your muscles tire from holding a single position--so that you can straighten up.  (There is no sound. The product page video that demonstrates the buzz is kind of amusing.)<br /><br />When you create an account (free), the app collects information about your height, weight, and age, and then generates a daily posture training program that is personalized for you.  The training program begins with your wearing the device for a few minutes, and then for longer and longer sessions.  At the end of a session, the app gives you a score, based on how long you held your upright posture.  (Mine was only 86%, because I intentionally slouched to test the buzz.)<br /><br />The Upright arrives fully charged.  The app tells you how much charge is remaining in your Upright.  When you're charging the device in the supplied charging dock, a solid red light tells you that it's properly connected and charging.",

I like that the LED glows under the knob, but I sort of wish it stayed on all the time so I could find it quickly in the dark (it lights up during use, but then seems to turn off the light after a few seconds of non use).<br />Personally, I wanted to use this to add a volume knob to my aftermarket car radio. For some reason, new head units all rely on buttons and touch screens, but I want a good old fashioned volume knob. Thankfully this is compatible pretty universally as a USB input device (no drivers, so even Android can recognize it!) so I can pop off the knob and drill a hole in my double din adapter to mount the knob behind my dash. Plug it in, and it changes the volume as needed. Awesome!

            "question": "title: Good head unit, excellent customer support!\ntext: [[VIDEOID:5f99a990ea71fc33e4d54b09c37038e2]] EDIT January 2023: I originally complained that Bluetooth used to only reconnect to the last phone used. This is an issue with all of their Android powered head units apparently, as the S8 did the same. However, I'm happy to say that customer support came though with a modified firmware that FIXED the problem! It will try to connect to the last device, but if not found will move on to connect to other previously-paired phones, as expected. I am now very happy with the unit for the asking price. Definitely would recommend!<br /><br />Originally review follows:<br />Before I go into what I don't like, let me tell you what this product is:<br />This is a buttonless edition of their popular A6 PF head unit. I can't tell if it is identical to the button version internally, but if you like the look of a smooth bezel-less design, this is the head unit to try!<br />I have tried and owned a few of their devices and largely love what you can get for the money. That's not even counting that their customer support has been EXTREMELY responsive! However there is one major user experience problem I just can't get past which makes it hard to recommend this to my friends.<br />If you are the only driver of your car, you'll likely never know or care about this, but all of Atoto's Android powered units (S8 included) will only pair automatically with the last phone used. That means if you share the car with other family members, and they drove the car last, your phone won't auto-connect next time you drive. It will be stuck looking for THAT phone (the last one) in perpetuity. You had to manually go into the settings for BT1 and find the list of paired phones, then click on yours, and THEN it will connect. Only to repeat this process the next time someone else drives and wants their phone to connect. It's silly, honestly. Their F7 doesn't do this, but the S8 also did. Most name-brand head units will move on to the next device in their paired list if the last one isn't found, I don't see why this device can't do that. They claimed it has something to do with security and specifically with Android units (which would be why the F7, based on linux does not have this limitation?). It does not make any sense to me and is a complete user experience failure, to the point that my wife has told me she might want us to go back to our old OEM head unit- at least that one would auto-connect to whoever is driving the car, regardless of who drove it last!<br />See attached video for demonstration.",

            "question": "title: Good for Google Users Like Me\ntext: Electronics are a fact of life and most families have multiple electronic devices to get through their day. My family of four has four cell phones, about six different pcs, laptops, and tablets, and three printers. Now, we also have our first ever Chromebook thanks to this Amazon product.<br /><br />Chromebooks, I quickly learned, differ from the usual windows or apple laptop in several important ways and chief among them is the limit on the number of things you can download. If you have specific games and other things you want to download, they may not work. I already knew this going in but I can tell from reading other reviews that some people were not aware that it worked this way and they now have a device with limited usefulness.<br /><br />Once you accept the Acer Chromebook for what it is, you will find that it does serve as a handy device. It’s excellent for browsing the internet, creating google docs, using google apps, and pretty much doing all things google. I am already a google chrome user when I go online and I already use many apps from the google play, so what this Chromebook offers is compatible with my needs.<br /><br />Looking at other specifics of this Acer Chromebook, it is about the same size as my old laptop, at least in terms of the screen size. The image is good, although I have seen other laptops/tablets with more pixels and sharper images. Still, it should be sufficient for most needs, and it has a good deal to offer for the price. I have noticed that the charge doesn’t hold as long as the manufacturer claims and the bottom of the Chromebook does feel hot a little sooner than with others. But the Acer Chromebook is still functional and it performs well enough for my needs.<br /><br />Electronics are a fact of life and as much as we try to limit their use, they are here to stay. Since we have to have them and use them, it makes sense to get the electronics that best suit our needs for a fair price and this Acer Chromebook does exactly that. It does have its limits and it cannot do everything that a windows or apple laptop can do, but as long as you know the limitations before you purchase, you should be fine.",

Just like with so many things there are aspects to like and aspects to not like.<br /><br />I will start with the negatives. If you are in a noisy environment, such as working out in an exercise room, the volume just is not loud enough or satisfactory at all. You need earplugs in the ears to get the satisfactory volume. Yes, earplugs. Of course, that defeats the whole purpose of buying headphones that do not go inside or cover your ears.<br /><br />You can test this out by simply putting a finger in each ear and then you'll hear the remarkable level of volume change.<br /><br />Because of the lack of loudness one can achieve in a noisy environment, I cannot recommend these (unless you want to buy earplugs and wear them at the same time).<br /><br />The only other negative for me personally is the lack of a way to go back to a previous song, or repeat the currently playing song. (You can skip forward to the next song, but you cannot go back.)<br /><br />The positives: These are comfortable to wear and very lightweight. The Bluez 2S offers the ability for decent call quality when using them to make calls. Microphones seem good (I have only tried this indoors, and not outdoors, so I cannot comment further on this particular subject.)<br /><br />The Bluez 2S are very easy to operate.<br /><br />In a quiet environment, volume is fine, and music quality is acceptable for this price point. (Of course you will not get the level of music quality or bass you'd get with a more expensive name brand headphones that go directly over the ear.)<br /><br />So, for specific purposes such as cell phone calls where you want to keep both ears free, these are quite good indeed, offering good voice quality for both parties. (Pairing with my iPhone 5 and 6S went flawlessly.)",

It's essential that you wash AND dust the tablet screen before placing the screen protector.  This is a thick glass screen protector that provides maximum scratch protection without interfering with touch screen sensitivity.  And it's clear that the seller gives excellent customer service.  Rating raised from 3 stars to 5 stars.<br /><br />This KINDLE FIRE HD 8 TEMPERED GLASS SCREEN PROTECTOR was a perfect fit for my 2017 Kindle Fire HD 8 (with Alexa), and it was very easy to apply.  It is a stiff glass sheet with gentle adhesive backing.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I caught a single dust mote between the screen protector and the tablet screen--and this caused a pea-sized (⅜”) air bubble that was highly noticeable.  The air bubble was impossible to remove, because the offending dust particle was trapped in the adhesive.  (This happened even though I started with a perfectly clean screen.  Removing and replacing the screen protector only resulted in even more trapped dust particles.)<br /><br />I’ve installed enough screen protectors to know that this was just bad luck, but for me the screen protector was a total loss.  I think that I’ll try a wet-application film next time, instead of another glass screen protector.",

            "question": "title: Lowepro SlingShot 202 AW\ntext: The fit and finish of this bag are top notch. I've been camping and backpacking for decades and I have to say the quality of this bag and the workmanship are among the best I've seen. The nylon material is heavy duty and durable. The bag and shoulder strap are well padded for comfort and protection of your gear. The pack includes a built in micro-fiber cloth and two memory card slots in the main compartment. There's even a tuck-away all-weather cover in the bottom of the bag for inclement weather situations. The dividers in the main compartment are infinitely adjustable and all can be removed/repositioned. The pack includes a  pull-out tripod holder/foot pocket and strapping system on the side of the bag. There's also a separate compartment at the top of the pack for personal items large enough for wallet, keys, an emergency poncho, etc. Also included are two smaller pockets on the  back of the pack suitable for lens pens, notepad, pens, what have you.<br /><br />This bag is huge. Easily as big as most hiking day-packs. There's room for everything and the kitchen sink. Currently I have my old Canon AE-1 with 80-200 mm lens attached. My 55 mm auxiliary lens. A half dozen assorted filters. Cable release. 1:1 reverse adapter AND my Kodak Z-650 point and shoot all in the main compartment.<br /><br />Ease of use is incredible. The shoulder strap and waist belt are widely adjustable for people of almost all sizes. The zippers work flawlessly and fast never catching or hanging. The velcro throughout the pack is quite heavy duty and looks like it will hold up to years of abuse. All you need do is slide the pack from your back to the front of your body and the camera access section is right there. You never have to take the bag off to get at your rig.<br /><br />Those are the pros.<br /><br />Here are just a couple cons:<br />The micro-fiber cloth is not removable. I'm not sure what you could do if it became soiled or stained and needed cleaning. The strap for the tripod is not fixed to the pack and could easily be lost. The all-weather cover fits very tight to the bag (in and of itself this is a good thing, but...) it won't fit over any but the smallest mono-pod or tripod. My [[ASIN:B00005T3TI Ambico 54 Inch Tripod with Quick Release (V-0555)]] just barely fits on the pack.<br /><br />I have no doubt this bag would last years for anyone from amateur to most demanding professional.",

With my iPod on a dock I can use these throughout my entire apartment including lobby with no drops or distortion.<br /><br />I apologize to Sennheiser for mistakenly blaming the headphones.  Here is the original review, unchanged.  Please note that any notes about the bluetooth quality is in error. I have also raised my review to the full five stars it deserves, 9 months later and I love these headphones.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I was very happy to receive a reviewer pair of these head phones.  They promise a great audio experience and for the most part they truly deliver.  I have recently moved into a very quiet apartment complex and was looking forward to being able to continue cranking my music while not disturbing my neighbors.<br /><br />I was impressed unboxing the headphones. These headphones are nicely engineered and I listened to them hardwired while charging the batteries, I was very happy with the sound quality.  The fit and comfort were nice, but a little warm and confining when compared to ear buds.  But, I lost a little love when using the bluetooth option.  The bluetooth set up was easy enough, but it was a little muddy when connected to my laptop.  Also the range was about 15 feet, and only line of sight so I could not leave the room without skips and dropouts.<br /><br />The only other word of critique I have for them is that their noise canceling is a little too effective.  I find myself missing phone calls when just 10 feet from the ringing phone.  These are very nice headphones when listening with the included headphone cable, but don't live up to their bluetooth promise for me.  I don't know if I would be very impressed for the price.

Maybe I'm just not camera savvy enough, but I seriously just wanted a simple point and shoot that would produce good quality photos. This camera comes with a ridiculous amount of fancy settings which I'm sure a lot of people enjoy.<br /><br />A big reason we got it was to replace our DSLR which I never really learned how to use and I wanted something simpler. I try to take photos of birds in the back yard and this camera is completely hopeless with that. It will not focus on anything you want it to focus on, especially if there's any movement. It'll focus right next to the bird or behind the bird or under the bird or wherever. So you have to try to zoom in to the bird so the camera focuses on it, then zoom out again and hope that it stays focused on your bird (or whatever).<br /><br />If you're looking to take photos of wildlife or anything of that sort, I'd find something else. We've switched back to the DSLR for wildlife photos so this camera will sit around to be used once a year with family or something.

The 102 is small enough for everyday toting - great size for everyday working folk who always keep their camera close at hand.<br />2. Enough space in the main compartment for a DSLR with medium telephoto/standard zoom lens attached, plus an off camera flash and one more lens.<br />3. Easy zippers allow quick access to the camera, and support straps keep it secure.<br />4. Comes with an all weather cover neatly tucked away in a pocket and a built in microfiber cloth.<br />5. Two external compartments and a pocket for small accessories.  Handy memory card pockets in main compartment.<br />6. Includes a tripod holder and strap<br />7. Nicely padded with customizable dividers<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1. The 102 is a lot smaller than it looks on-line.  A Nikon SB900 flash can't stand upright as illustrated, but has to be pivoted over the DSLR compartment.<br />2. The upper compartment can't hold a change of clothes, or anything other than small accessories, keys, a wallet and a couple of calling cards.  It can hold filters, a small lens or a point and shoot camera.<br />3. Can only hold compact tripods or monopods, and even then, it becomes unwieldy.<br />4. If you sling the strap over one shoulder, the bag isn't balanced and keeps slipping off your shoulder, especially if you're doing anything with your other hand.<br />5. If you sling it over your head and across your back as illustrated, it's stable, but not comfortable for the female anatomy, and certainly not aesthetically pleasing for frontal views.<br />6. If you use the additional support strap, it doesn't fit around your waist as it should, but across your chest, hence even more problems for female photographers with curves.<br />7. No place for water bottle, no cell phone pouch on strap<br /><br />I bought this to use for everyday toting of my DSLR.  Size wise it works for this purpose, but is not comfortable to walk around with.  It's not big enough for travel or comfortable enough for nature shoots, or weddings, or suitable for anywhere you'll need extra gear, water or clothes.  Definitely not for a theme park or hiking expedition.<br />I would recommend this to male urban or street photographers (or non-zaftig female photographers).<br /><br />Amanda Richards<br />July 22, 2013",

I have an assortment of zip ties in various sizes for various tasks. If you didn't know, it is better to go a little larger than what you think you need as the length indicated is entire length and not just working length. I just so happened to have had a need for the smaller size (6\" or less) zip ties to secure some corners on a multi tier wire crate. I ratcheted them tight and trimmed off the excess. In all, I used about two dozen immediately. With a pack of 500 I should be set for awhile. Always better to have too many of these than not enough. I'll be using them for sure to secure snow netting. Not on the posts (need 10-12\" ties for that), but to hold together the overlap going from one roll or piece to the next. Since a section of netting always gets blown apart at some point during the winter, I just head out with a handful of zip ties and put it back together again. So yeh, 500 seems like a lot, but when you have them you need a bunch of them.<br /><br />The 6 inch size is also great for wire management in general, and just about any small sized securing needs.<br /><br />No complaints.

In order to avoid disturbing him, I use a fancy pair of noise cancellation earphones that vost several pretty pennies. They work well, but can feel heavy after an hour or two.<br /><br />This set is a decent substitute that I won't feel bad about breaking/dropping etc. They are extremely light and don't have noise cancellation, but that's fine. The fit is decent and the ear covers are soft and don't feel hot. The sound quality is better than expected - audiobooks are clear and clean. I listened to a bit of country and classical music with these and the music sounds right, but not quite as pure as with my Bose headphones - of course, that's not a fair comparison. Still, these are a good option for basic stuff.",

I used the &quot;middle&quot; quality setting for the pictures, and managed to take over 130 photos (the equivalent of 5-6 24-shot rolls of film), filling not anywhere close to half the card (at that setting, the card will store over 300 photos)!<br />I'm not a digital photography technoid by any stretch of the imagination -- I just like capturing memories of the places I go and the things I see.  Having the extra memory afforded by this little card meant that I could relax and not worry about running out of space for all my photos.<br />Transferring the photos to my laptop was a piece of cake, and took very little time -- partially a function of the card.<br />I highly recommend this as the *first* accessory/upgrade you purchase for your camera!",

            "question": "title: Versatile tablet stand with unique cable management...\ntext: The arm and the base of this stand is mostly metal. All the white things you see are plastic. It's a little unique than most because the holes are for cable management. So if you're someone who likes to keep their phone or tablet plugged in at all times, then you'll appreciate the built in cable system. The arm and base weighs about 2.2 lbs. The holder is 3.6 ounces and all plastic. The 360 rotation at the neck requires loosening and tightening of the wingnut. I'm a stickler for higher quality holders. Maybe there is an engineering purpose to make the holder all plastic, but I've seen higher quality holders that is made of both plastic and metal, especially the extension spring part. I've seen metal rods for this part, and that's what I would have preferred. Overall, I give this stand a 4-Stars!<br /><br />Now if you don't care for the cable management holes, you might want to check out another tablet stand that is all metal at the base and arms, but it also has an all plastic holder. But where it has an advantage is that it can hold tablets/ipads up to 12.9 inches. This Bracwiser version only holds up to 11 inches. This other tablet is more heavy duty at 3 lbs and the 360 rotation does not require loosening or tightening of a nut. Both are vine items for me, so I have no dog in this fight.

            "question": "title: Excellent Value; Does Not Strobe\ntext: I do a lot with photography and I always keep my eyes open for good lighting solutions that will help me get the lighting effects I want or need for given situations. I saw this one at a reasonable price and decided to take a chance on it. So far I am very pleased with it. It meets the biggest requirement I have for lighting - it does not strobe.<br /><br />So many LED lights have an issue with strobing, especially when they’re low-cost. This light is not expensive when compared to a lot of others, so even though it is marketed as a video light I was only cautiously optimistic. To determine this for sure, I set my camera to use the electronic shutter only, sped up the shutter speed as high as I could and pointed directly at the light when it was powered on. Strobing lights always show banding in pictures with higher shutter speeds when using the electronic shutter; this one did not (though the display on the camera sure did but that’s a different problem). This test proved to me that this LED light does not strobe, at least not slow enough for my camera sensor to see it at high shutter speeds.<br /><br />This is a fairly large LED panel, designed for video use of course but I also can work just fine for photography or even general lighting in the right setting. It comes with a clamp mount and a pole so it can be attached to a desk or shelf, then the mounting head allows for angling the light as needed so it can light a surface at just the right angle desired. The mount is sturdy and there should be no issues with stability when it is set up properly.<br /><br />The light is super-easy to adjust. There are two dials on the back for tweaking the brightness and the temperature range, and there is a remote included that does the same. The temperature can be adjusted from a warm 2800K to a blistering white 8000K and everywhere in between so you can get the lighting just right.<br /><br />Power is via an AC adapter and there is no battery. So, this is not a travel light by any means, If you need a light to use in the field, unless you have a power generator with you then this light isn’t it. For a static setting in a studio or room, this light is very good.<br /><br />One design decision that would have been nice would have been a detachable mount so it could be used with a standard tripod instead of a clamp mount. That’s not a big deal, especially at the price point, but it would have made this light so much more versatile. I have other lights that I can mount on a tripod, so I am not too concerned.<br /><br />This is a very good video light, especially when considering the price point. It has excellent temperature range, it has a solid mount for stability, and it does not strobe. If you’re looking for a solid video LED light that won’t cost a fortune, this one is better than could be reasonably expected at the asking price. It’s an easy one to recommend.",

There is no room for a regular-sized purse inside this bag due to the design. However, this can be used as a purse and laptop carrier all in one. I have no idea how much this will cost since no price is listed at this time. The zippers flow easily except for the very top size zipper that opens to the water bottle pocket. That one sticks on me a bit.  I doubt if this will be listed for less than $25.",

I would buy it at the pre-Christmas price of $250.00, but at this price I think I will consider a TCL with more feedback and a two year warranty. Pity. I would have preferred the lower price and then I could have gotten a 3 year Square Trade warranty to buffer my purchase. I will keep an eye on this for the next few days before I make my final decision. I am giving it 3 stars for the massive, sudden hike in price.<br /><br />Update: Thanks to David Miller for the reminder, this review was due for an update. The price did come down, as it tends to when one makes an issue of it on Amazon - especially when there is an intention to purchase stated in the complaint. I have used this tactic several times now and it has paid off every time so far (3 times now, I think). And I am very glad I complained and then followed through on my intention to purchase this item. I bought it on Jan. 17th, 12 days after posting my initial complaint about the huge price hike.<br /><br />This is a wonderful TV with great, easy to use features. The most important to me were that it has a truly great picture that is easily tweaked to my preferred specs. Also, it boasts 3 HDMI ports, one of which is conveniently located on the side, along with a USB port. It also has RCA inputs and component inputs, as well as an S-video input. All in all, I can hook just about anything up to this little gem of a TV! Overall, I am not as enamored of the sound quality from the unit as some of the other reviewers seem to be, but it really is better than what most other TVs give off, so that's just fine too.<br /><br />The controls and functions are very user-friendly and it takes no time at all to be cruising along smoothly, switching from one input to another.<br /><br />I have been shopping for a second TV for the upstairs bedroom and I have yet to find one that compares to this one for price, quality and features. I may very well be buying a second one very soon... as soon as the price comes down some more... ;)<br /><br />UPDATE: January 25, 2017. Five years later. Still working perfectly.

            "question": "title: Serious (and odd) design flaw makes it uncomfortable to hold in your hand - not a good case for reading\ntext: I looked at a lot of cases before selecting this one, and I am sad to say I am very disappointed in this purchase. I have an Omoton case for my Kindle PaperWhite. I really like the design of the shell--the way Kindle fits into on it, so I was trying to find something similar, where the entire unit is enclosed all the way around. This was the only case I found which appeared to fit this way, so I ordered it. Build quality is fine, and the Kindle does fit snugly in the case, providing the fit I was looking for. Unfortunately, there is a serious (and odd) design flaw in this case: a small lip that protrudes outwards and runs all the way around the edge of the unit.<br /><br />This lip serves no purpose, and I do not understand why it was built into the design. I don't know why the lip did not register as a potential problem when I was making the decision to buy the unit--I suppose I thought it would be too small to matter. I was wrong. It matters. It is not an issue when you are not holding it: for example, using the tablet to watch movies and it is supported by the folded case on a flat surface (although this feels somewhat precarious/barely balanced). The issue is when you are holding the case in your hand and trying to read with your Kindle: the lip digs into your palm or fingers and after a few minutes becomes uncomfortable. You end up shifting the kindle to your other hand every couple of minutes. This is uncool, and makes what would otherwise be a great case almost unusable as a hand-held device. I thought about returning it, but given the hassle involved, I decided not to bother for a $12 unit.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this case. If you plan on reading with this case (i,.e. holding it in your hand for any length of time), it will be uncomfortable (sure is for me anyway).",

This cable works and it does charge my cell phone in the car, but when used with the same car charger as the other two cables mentioned above, my phone  charges much more slowly. I noticed the same problem when using this cable plugged directly into the USB outlet in my truck vs using the other two cables. I am charging a two month old LG V10 phone in the truck normally. This morning I switched things up and tried with a brand new (2 days) Sony Xperia X phone - exact same issue - very slow charging.<br /><br />My LG typically gains a 10% bump in the truck in the time it takes me to drive from Starbucks to the horse barn every morning - this is while it plays my audio book via blue tooth at the same time. Yesterday with this StarTech cable my LG gained went from 83% on the battery to 86% under the exact same conditions.

I listen to it while I'm working in the milking parlor so I judge based on how well I can hear it over the various sounds in the milking parlor.... not the greatest acoustics in there but I'm looking for function, not basing my review on any of the sound quality technicalities.  As long as I can hear the music and the speakers last throughout the 6 hours it takes to milk I'm a happy camper.  Anyway, the speaker performed even better than I'd hoped since I could hear the sound as well in the back of the parlor as well as the front (normally with the rectangular speakers I've tried either the back or front of the parlor has better sound quality - not sure why that is though) - and it lasted all the way through milking with battery life to spare (and that was listening to it at max volume.<br /><br />I did knock the speaker down one star because of the charger cord.  The minute I took it out of the box I just knew I was going to end up losing it and sure enough I did!

            "question": "title: Acer gets 5 stars....Amazon gets a zillion.\ntext: I did a little homework and this machine, especially at the price looked excellent.  I noticed in reading Amazon reviews that a small percentage of buyers had received machines with faulty screens. So I went to BestBuy to see what they had, and found nothing appealing in any where near this price.  So I ordered one.  It arrived on Wednesday (days matter in this little story).  Knowing there was a slight risk, I opened everything very carefully, saved everything in case I'd want to return it.  Sure enough  I got one with a faulty screen.  However I'd also calculated the odds: very slim chance of getting two in a row.  Thursday we started what I thought was likely to be a tricky, time consuming effort: filling forms, emails, getting to UPS, etc etc.  It went like this: one click to get to the trade request on the Amazon order, five minutes to complete it ....Including a stunning question: did I want to drop the first one at UPS, or have them pick it up at my door?  UPS would have the prepaid return label with them.<br />Then they shipped the replacement to me Thursday. SAME DAY!  Monday the new one arrived, the man had the return label in his hand.He took one look at my shipping ready packaged box, slapped the label on, and left while I watched still in disbelief. This is way beyond 5 stars for Amazon.<br /><br />And true to the odds, this machine I'm using for this is flawless. I love it.  It's everything it is advertised to be, and more. The slowness some mentioned was easily remedied for my use by clearing the &#34;Start Up&#34;,  using Blackle as a homepage, and one click to change the &#34;Next Window&#34; screen.  I don't play complex games, just puzzles, solitaire and the like so no need for speed there.  Pictures, movies and TV are all beautiful, and quick to load.<br /><br />The Windows 10 Home is surprisingly user friendly...and I'm 72.  The machine runs cool, easy to upgrade, and most of all: affordable. So don't be afraid to take a chance if you're waffling.  Thank you Amazon!  Very much.",

            "question": "title: It's Small, but it Makes a Big Difference\ntext: When listening to your favorite tunes, videos, etc., sound enhancement makes a noticeable difference. Cell phones and other electronic devices are often quite lacking in sound quality, mainly because the sounds are directed to a tiny speaker. An enhancement can make music and other noises come to life and the Xboom Mini Portable Capsule Speaker is ready to serve in this regard.<br /><br />This speaker is small, stylish, and versatile and I have used it with several different electronic devices. It is very compact in size, operates on a rechargeable battery, and can be collapsed to a size so small that it fits into tight quarters with ease. Just plug it into a cell phone, tablet, or other device, flip the switch, adjust the volume, and listen to your favorite music like never before.<br /><br />I was skeptical when I first used this device because it just didn’t seem capable of much. It looks cool, but it’s just so small. How much sound could possibly release itself from such a tiny speaker, I wondered. But a few uses demonstrate that this little speaker is capable of many great things. It doesn’t produces deafening decibels, no. But the volume is much louder than that of a typical cell phone or tablet. And the bass enhancement makes it sound like a true stereo speaker. I was pleasantly surprised when I used it and I couldn’t believe something so seemingly miniscule and insignificant would be capable of so much.<br /><br />The battery in this little guy is good for about 12 hours of use, according to the manufacturer. Truth is, I have never had to worry about this because, if you use the USB cord and plug into a computer, you don’t need to charge it first. My kids like to use it in their cell phones and they are always careful to maintain the charge. Twelve hours is a long time and the reason I know it’s a long time is because, in a few months of use, it has never exhausted its charge. The kiddos can use it on a lengthy road trip and it maintains its juice.<br /><br />Many smaller electronics need better sound and the Xboom Mini Portable Capsule Speaker is a very good device for improving your next audio experience. Multiple units can be plugged together for even greater satisfaction but even if you have only one, you will find this little gadget is more than able to deliver very good sound quality. It’s one of my favorite electronic enhancers and one I and my kids will continue to use.",

            "question": "title: Excellent Cables at a Great Price\ntext: I have a good tangle of cables in my home office for a variety of devices that require a micro-USB cable. Most of these cables are very nondescript and I have no idea who made them, though there are a couple of them that have manufacturer names printed on the plugs on the end. Most are plain black and are mostly indistinguishable from one another. These cables from Magic-T are absolutely the most easily identifiable cables on the desk and it has made it very easy to assign cables to every device on the desk. But, there is more to these cables than just pretty colors.<br /><br />The most obvious advantage of this cable set is the colors. Each of these cables is a different color and none of them are black or gray - there’s blue, pink, orange and green. And, even more important than the color is the fact that they are insulated in nylon weave, not plastic coating, which in my experience holds up a bit better under stress and the result is a more reliable cable.<br /><br />The plugs on both ends are metal shielding with a plastic base, sufficient to give these strength for the connections. The cables have been inserted in the bases and attached within, not attached to the plug base, but those connections are very tight and seem to be solid so I am not concerned about them pulling loose.<br /><br />Each cable is about six and a half feet in length which is much more convenient for me than the regular 3' cables.<br /><br />These cables are capable of high-speed charging so if you have a device and a charger that are both capable of high-speed charging then these cables will work well for you. I used one for my tablet and a high-speed USB charger and the tablet did charge faster than when using a lower-grade cable.<br /><br />I want to mention the pricing. As I write this, the price on this set of four cables is about $9. That’s about $2.25 per cable, and the cables are of good quality. The price can change of course, but at the current price this is an absolute bargain.<br /><br />There’s something else I need to mention. The manufacturer offers a 12-month warranty on these cables, and to me that’s just amazing. For a cable that costs less than $2.50 per individual cable the manufacturer thinks enough of their product to back it with a 12-month warranty. I doubt I would ever need to use the warranty for one of these, but it’s reassuring to know the manufacturer believes in their products.<br /><br />It is hard to find fault with these cables. They are made well, they are easily identifiable and they are very inexpensive. This is a fine set at a great price.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.",

            "question": "title: Poor support\ntext: Lenovo warranty service is non functional. When trying to resolve and issue I was presented with an option to purchase a solution. We have a Lenovo G580 laptop with wireless network connection issues. We have been dealing with this issue from time of purchase, about 4 months. The laptop will loose connection and will not be able to connect without shutting off the laptop and then powering back up. When I called for support I was given the latest drivers to update the laptop, this looked like it fixed the problem but not for long. The laptop still had problems with losing connection. When I called again the hardware department stated that the issue was due to the software on the system. This has happened from time of purchase, so I asked if this would still be covered. The answer was no because they did not feel it was a hardware issue and the only way to continue was to purchase a $179 warranty support package or a $89 single case package. With a guaranteed solution to be provided after the purchase.<br /><br />I was not going to go forward with this option because I do not want to pay for something that should be covered. If Lenovo knows the solution and charges customers more to fix a problem that is from the factory then this will be the last time I purchase and Lenovo or IBM equipment.<br /><br />I instead purchased a $14 usb wireless adapter from the local electronics store. After installing this device and using it, instead of the onboard device, I have not had any connection issues. The system is working without any issues. If this is a software issue then it is a \"hardware\" driver software issue that is only supported by Lenovo.<br /><br />I feel that this is just a way for Lenovo to make extra money from the customers who purchase their products.",

Not only does it work in the car for road warriors that need to meet a deadline or watch a lot of videos, but it makes it easy to power up off other DC sources without an additional inverter.<br />In my case, I do a lot of live streaming events and need to power a laptop for hours, usually too far away from a plug to be charged. So I carry around a portable power bank that offers 12v DC car outlets, and this is PERFECT for use with that!<br /><br />Something to note: While my Lenovo and HP laptops were easy to identify the correct plug right away (yellow square and blue tip), my Acer was a little bit more difficult. Each plug tells you what voltage it is (printed on the plastic), and I found one that fit but was .5 volt lower than it needed to be. Usually if it is within range of the specifications it would work, but in this case it would power the laptop but not charge it. Only when I opened the booklet and saw there was a listing of different specific numbered tips with compatible models did I notice there was a better match, and upon switching to that one I'm happy to say my Acer was charging fine after that. I took a picture of the booklet for reference and am uploading it here.<br /><br />Also interesting to note, I own both a MS Surface and older magsafe Macbook Pro, neither of which have tips included in this set. Strange as those are popular laptops. However those aren't ones that I use for live streaming, somehow all of the ones I DO have the included plugs here. But I feel like it is important to point out that certain popular models are omitted in case you are looking for support. If you have any of the laptops in the list shown, it's a great product!",

But no night vision.  And some record only when motion detected,  but only 6-12 seconds, what use is that? And many have a privacy policy that you absolutely have to agree to, or camera doesnt work. And those policies state that the company can access your personal information, files and data.

I am quite pleased; in heaviness and thickness these are the same as the old Fitbit bands, and instead of having that annoying \"button\" closure, these bands have a proper buckle. In fact, they are a little difficult to get off because the little retainer strap that keeps the end of the notched part of the strap from sticking out has a little protrusion on it that clicks into the notches, so when taking the band on and off you have to figure out how to lift the little protrusion from the slot to get the band to come out of the retainer. However, this gives you a little measure of extra safety when the Fitbit is buckled on, so I feel it's a fair tradeoff.<br /><br />These come in a variety of colors; you can go wild with metallics, or bright pinks and blues, or just do as I did and give your wrist a tiny fillip with purple or blue if you don't want to resort to sober black and grey.",

All you have to do is add an SD card, and you can insert one up to 32GB. To be honest, all you need is a 4GB card since the camera itself will operate for an hour fully charged. For the extreme sports type videos this was designed to capture, an hour is a long time, so the operating time is certainly not a limitation.<br /><br />Video quality is respectable and after you spend some time experimenting to fill in the gaps in the documentation you will fall in love with the camera. I attempted to use mine mounted to a microphone stand to capture practice sessions with me and a pianist. It can be done, but the results were less than spectacular. However, strapping this to a handlebar or helmet and dirt biking, skydiving or similar activities would result in some priceless shots.<br /><br />For the right audience this is a great camera.

The phone receiver is so clean looking, it plugs directly into the port and is self powered by your phone, so no additional batteries or charging needed. It just sits there, like a chin bump. The transmitter needs 2 AAA batteries (4 if you want to use both transmitters).<br />Note: On some devices like the OnePlus phones, the built in camera app doesn't recognize external microphones, so you'll need to download something like Open Camera (excellent free app I recommend anyway for more camera control). Pixel and Samsung phones I tried this with did not require that.<br />ALSO- when this is plugged in, it registers itself as a \"headset\" to the phone, so it will not play back audio until you unplug it. I was able to monitor the audio via the headphone jack going in, but then I could not hear it recorded until I unplugged the receiver. This is simply how it works on Android and not the fault of the unit, however it would be nice if a future version could route outgoing sound over the included headphone jack (I was a bit disappointed it did not do this, however the product was so good I still want to give it 5 stars).",

They can be fairly loud and can be heard even with (especially with) earplugs.<br /><br />The advantages of an open-ear, bone conduction headphone is that you can hear everything going on around you while still being able to listen to your music or audiobook.  Put earplugs in your ear and you can retreat into a more private listening experience.<br /><br />The disadvantage is that the sound quality is just not going to be as good as headphones that cover your ears.  That is especially true for this pair of headphones.<br /><br />The sound quality from these headphones is not good.  The lows are barely audible most of the time and when you turn up the volume to try and hear more of the lower tones (including human voices), the higher tones are already too loud.  This is alleviated by putting in earplugs.  The plugs will block most of the higher tones as those come out of the speakers themselves while the low tones come in through the vibrations.<br /><br />Another issue I have is that the buttons are horrible.  They are made of a single piece of rubber on the outside and the buttons themselves are recessed pretty far in.  This means that I have to push quite far before actually hitting the button and there is just no tactile response to know that I've actually pressed it.  This makes everyday use of these headphones a chore.<br /><br />The last problem I have with it is the custom charging cable.  I really do not like devices that do this.  Not only do you have to remember to bring the cable with you if you need to charge in your car or elsewhere, if it breaks, you're pretty much screwed.<br /><br />For the price they are charging (more than Aftershokz Titanium), this really isn't worth it.",

I wish I could review them separately because the USB host part works perfectly!

I wanted this for my Amazon FireStick 4k, which was successfully given a USB port which can be used for things like game controllers and wireless keyboard/mouse combos, etc.<br />The USB hub + Ethernet works alright- the USB ports, at least, work fine. I'm able to plug in a keyboard and wireless controller adapter dongle, and everything works fine and is recognized by the Firestick. You can even plug in a USB storage stick to play local content. But I REALLY wanted the Ethernet port to get a stronger connection by the TV for streaming. I know there are other USB host / ethernet combos that work with the FireStick, it is capable of working with the right hardware. I thought this would be one of them since it claims to be \"for Streaming TV Stick\" in the description, however the Ethernet port does NOT work. I'll have to try to source my own and see if I can use it with the USB host this offers. The Ethernet port did show up on my Windows desktop when I tried the hub there, so maybe it just isn't compatible with Android/non desktops? I don't know.

It was also immediately recognized and functional on my ThinkPad T61 running XP.<br /><br />As great as it is, you need to pay attention to details when unpacking it. Specifically, the cardboard insert in the retail packaging has a web site for the manual. That is important because this thing will make no sense to you without it, unless you have used one of these before. The manual you will want to download is for model KP-810-10.<br /><br />Basically, the dongle is cleverly stored in the body of the keyboard, and the key is to find the small power switch, which is on the upper left side. After that you are literally up and running. While this makes a wonderful remote for a PC doing presentations, it's even handier connected to any android phone or device that recognizes an OTG connection. That is where this thing excels.  However, for Windows PCs this is also optimum because it has Windows keys.<br /><br />If you need a remote for a Windows PC, or want a convenient way to interact with your OTG-capable phone or tablet this may well become your best friend.

I've tested using in another room from my phone about 30 feet with the door closed. Did not drop the signal.<br />2. Noise isolation is very good. Can't hear my kids yelling and the dog barking.<br />3. Quality of sound is very good. Bass is good.<br />5. Charge lasts at least 4 hours from my testing. They will last longer but I have not tested beyond that. They recharge in about an hour or so. Standard USB connector for charging is good. So I can use other cables if need be.<br />4. Fit works very well after getting used to putting them on. They do not fall off during jogging or other high motion exercises.<br />6. BT connects automatically after first setup. My other BT headphones do not and it's an extra painful step that these allow me to skip.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Fit gets to be uncomfortable after longer uses. This is acceptable, as these need to be secure in your ear so they don't fall out while moving around or exercising. I would not recommend if you will be using for longer periods of time, as comfort will probably be an issue. Not as much a Con on the product but the type of headphone.<br />2. Profile could be a bit smaller. They sick out a bit far but not any more than other BT headphones I've seen. I would have liked to wear these under my motorcycle helmet but they stick out too far.",

Upon extending the legs to set it up, it broke and I cannot fix it. There are these little thin, plastic tabs inside each piece of tubing that extends. The washer came off, the plastic tabs went flying, I placed them back, and the leg was stuck. I tried to retrieve them to try placing it again, and they were lost in the larger section of tubing. I carefully and methodically removed the larger washer to find the tabs, and they were so far up inside I couldn't retrieve them, so I replaced the plastic tabs from the larger piece, carefully placed it back... and low and behold those disappeared inside as well.<br /><br />This is the worst engineered product I have ever encountered in my life. I cannot fathom paying anything for this. It's worthless garbage to me now. It cannot be used. I feel sorry for all the people that spent precious time of their life designing, manufacturing, selling and shipping this piece of trash. An entire tripod leg will no longer fix into place, because of these thin plastic tabs. Maybe this could have been saved by threading the adjustment washers differently, or even a piece of tape holding the plastic tabs. I cannot say for sure. What I can say is, this would be a waste of money. It's much too easy to unscrew the washers, then those tabs come out. They cannot be placed back. Once they are inside the tube, they are gone.<br /><br />If I can somehow manage to fix this, I will update. Until then, don't waste your money. I would not even recommend this to someone I don't like.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review. I hope you have found it helpful.",

It has lots of great features, including a Wifi app, but resolution/quality even on the highest settings are slightly disappointing. I have everything configured to provide the sharpest possible image (highest resolution and bit rate, etc.), and if a car is more than 30' away, zooming in on a screenshot of a license plate is iffy at best, even if the footage was taken in bright daylight (screencaps taken in VLC). Something seems off to me. Yes, I removed the protective films, and yes, my window is reasonably clean (normal conditions). I have attached two photos: one of the unit in a fantastic little case I found for it (see below), and a screencap showing the problem I described. The van in front of me is semi-readable, and was about 25 feet away. The car 15-20 feet further away on the left is unreadable, as is the plate close to me on the left. And yes, I have the CPL filter installed on the lens.<br /><br />Configuring this was a bit of a hassle. The Wi-Fi app is not intuitive, and some quick googling led me to discover you have to temporarily disable your cellular data the first time you use it to get the camera to connect. Once configured, the camera itself acts as the network your phone connects to. This means your phone cannot be connected to any other Wi-Fi network while you are connected to the camera. I have no idea why they don't just allow you to use Bluetooth for this--it would be simpler to set up, that's for sure. Honestly, having integrated security video will be a factor in the next car I purchase. This is all way too much work.<br /><br />Many PCs will not play the default file format this records in as they lack the correct video codec (H.265) or enough processing power. I think there must be a way to change the format it records in, but I was unable to find the configuration setting to change in either the app or the camera itself. To get this to play files on your PC, I suggest using VLC Player. It is free, and if you are running the latest version (check for updates in the application), it will run them just fine if your PC has the juice for HD at this level. If you experience dropped frames or choppy video when playing back on your computer, this is probably because your computer is not equipped with a GPU to support this high resolution of video (many aren't; if you don't have a dedicated video card in your PC, you may experience this). My office desktop does not have a dedicated video card and the video is a bit choppy if other things are running--expected.<br /><br />If you are interested, the case is the \"Mchoi Hard EVA Travel Case for Garmin inReach Mini GPS\", (ASIN: B08F9QV1BQ), which is very sturdy and cost me $13.49 in Feb 2021.

You can easily compress the sides with one finger.<br /><br />The description also claims this has a 'padded inner pocket.' The elasticized strip that divides the case in two is no thicker than a heavy-weight T-Shirt. It offers your GPS no real protection at all.<br /><br />The walls, sides, faces of the case have no padding whatsoever. I was forced to improvise padding with a divider taken from one of my camera gear bags.<br /><br />The case does not seal. The zippers come ¾'s of the way up the side and then there's an extra piece of vinyl stitched to both sides of the case. Forming something like a collar. The flap that velcro's over the top does not hold the collar section tightly closed. You can easily slip a finger into the case with it 'closed'. This means dirt and moisture, etc. have an easy path to your GPS. Additionally, I've had this for less than four hours and the velcro patch the flap attaches to is already pulling free of the case!<br /><br />My [[ASIN:B005HSDL8S 5\" Garmin nüvi 50LM]] barely fits in the Zeikos IR-CA101 Large Hard Case side to side but there is a lot, too much really, front to back room.

I guess that's a good thing meaning the seal it tight but I would hate to have to move a Kindle in and out of this as due to the weight and design I would only want my device in this type of case when such protection was necessary.",

            "question": "title: Created and fit rocksolid.. Love the extra neck support!\ntext: How great is this.. sure! It’s a phone cord- and that falls along the same lines of reviewing a pair of underpants… But hey, just like underpants- we all need them, appreciate when made of good quality and love it when they’ve got a good trustability factor- A factor that they’re going to do their job.. and do it well!! Yep- totally the same😝!!<br /><br />• Ordered 3ft. red cord- And I’m loving the integrity of the nylon braid.. In our house, we are hard on charge cords! Love love love the red.. and here’s a HACK: assign each one of your kids a color of a cord- that way, no one is taking the other persons bc, “they know it’s theres!” or accidentally, leaving behind at a friends- bc, a colored cord is so obvious to locate and easy to see!! You’re welcome..<br /><br />• Love the neck support.. in fact, I look specifically for this when ordering a replacement cord! With the ergonomically cut, bendable rubber protection, it offers extra support and keeps the cord from the ever dreaded breakage these are prone too.<br /><br />•Comes in a perfect box. So, Keep it!! Then, if traveling you have extra protection and safety for the cord itself- I included a photo, showing the slide box mechanism. It’s perfect for storing again and again..!! Box reminds me of a match box- it’s perfect.<br /><br />•Connecting into device is a smooth fit. It connects without issue- and does so, firmly. I haven’t received the obnoxious “cord not supported by this devise” message.. Hallelujah!<br /><br />•Charging speed is an important factor- I don’t know that I notice a large difference in length of time to charge from 0-100... but, where I do think this has high speed factor- is in quick “boosts” -When needing to get the phone a solid 25-35% amount of power and in a hurry.. this gives good, quick burst of power, quite fast!<br /><br />Overall, getting a replacement cord should be about quality. listed at a higher price point- I feel longevity should be a must.. As of now, all my picky requirements have been met and then some. If, looking for a dependable replacement option- this is a great option.<br />Hope this info helps.. feel free to let me know!",

I upgraded my cpu to i9 9900k and GPU to 3080 FTW3.  Im likely bottlenecked at the CPU level, but ill take care of this later.<br /><br />UPDATE 10/19/2021 4 to 5 stars after using for 2 years:<br /><br />CPU had random starting issues for a long time. as I initially wrote..  I never updated my bios since there wasnt any major updates.  Then one day it stopped working.  F7 error.  I was perplexed.  So I updated my bios directly through the motherboard.  A bit of a hassle, took about an hour or two to get it figured out and reset.  Its has been working flawlessly for 2 months now.  OS actually starts and loads a bit faster without any weird startup issues.  In any case, really enjoy this motherboard.  So definitely recommend getting it. Just update it and make sure you have backup BIOS on the other 2 slots since the working one can get corrupted for whatever reason.<br /><br />Without adding to what others have said, I will say this is the great sounding motherboard.  Assuming you dont use the internal DAC and just use the SPIDF output cable to an external DAC you will get very good results.  Dont bother wasting money on external sound cards.  That being said, the internal DAC is passable[for non-serious listening], but thats besides the point. This motherboard isnt made for audio. However, its apparent they use quality parts on the motherboard.<br /><br />There are some negatives to this motherboard, and I dont know if its just because I bought mine from AMZN warehouse, which is supposed to be LIKE NEW, or because its how it is generally, but it gets a bit temperamental sometimes, and wont start right away. The bios boots, resets, multiples times before it gets to windows.  Sometimes it doesnt boot right away.  Ive checked against my other parts as well and they are fine.  However, this only happens very rarely. Ive had this two months or so and maybe 4 times?<br /><br />The other negative is the cheap I/O shield. They need to do something about this one.  It may have something to do with the fact that it makes it easier to adjust to different cases. However, it is really cheap...",

            "question": "title: Impressive\ntext: I have put together many, many computers using cases of all shapes, sizes and costs.  Dollar for dollar this case is hands down the best value I've ever seen.  As others have noted the materials are a bit flimsy but this is a computer case, not the frame for a tank.  As long as it isn't abused it should last and give good service for years.  And I like that is fairly light weight, many cases that are \"sturdy\" are also on the heavy side.  By the time you have them loaded with a good power supply and several hard drives they begin to feel like a tank when you need to move them.<br /><br />The cutouts and gaps to make routing cables easy are nice, they not only improve the appearance but also help air flow freely through the case.  I was a little worried about sharp edges but have not found any, which is good because knowing me if there was even one I would have cut myself on it.<br /><br />I read several reviews which mention the hard drive rails being difficult and backwards so I wasn't sure what to expect.  At first I was a little confused about how the hard drives are meant to be installed but once I understood it, it makes perfect sense and is no problem to work with.  If you have right angled power and data cable ends you can mount the drives facing left or right which might make things easier if you have several drives installed.<br /><br />Another thing that both surprised and pleased me was when I was installing the power supply I noticed there were two extra holes which makes it possible to mount the ps either right side up or upside down.  I am not a huge fan of bottom mount for power supplies and as others have said, it can cause problems if the leads for motherboard power are not long enough.  Mine just barely reached to the cpu power connector after running it up the rear of the case, resting as it is on the motherboard and running under the video card.  I have extensions on order though I'm sure I could get by for the life of the ps as it is now.<br /><br />I like the long, thin blue light on the front for power on though the green light for hard drive activity is a bit hard to see.  Most of all though, I love the paint.  No more of that ugly, dingy looking gray metal with thoughts of how I want to paint it black.  I am not an expert on such things but I believe the paint is baked on giving it a very nice texture and appearance.<br /><br />This is a case I would not have been disappointed by if I had paid 60 dollars.  Getting it from amazon for 36 with free prime shipping is one of the best deals I've ever found.<br /><br />Three cheers to NZXT !!!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B002UDK9U6 GAMMA Classic Series ATX Mid Tower Interior Steel Chassis (Black)]]",

I say a lot of faith because, though the magnet is very powerful, and the unit is very well crafted, there aren't any metal surfaces on the dashboards of most cars, so the camera would have to attach to the outside of the vehicle.

It's kind of a monster, so this is subjective, but it definitely lets people know there is serious power inside.<br />-SO MUCH STORAGE. seriously I ran out of SATA ports before i ran out of drive space.<br />-excellent cooling. my roommate has a similar build as mine in a phanteks case that gets uncomfortably warm.<br />-lots of room for modding or decoration. for the DIY inclined i would strongly recommend it<br />-the GPU holder is a great addition<br /><br />CONS:<br />-didn't fit my motherboard. did not have the correct standoff holes for an MSI 970-A KRAIT edition, which i believe is a standard ATX motherboard. The right side of the motherboard is to this day completely unsupported. this makes changing RAM a pretty scary endeavor.<br />-a PSU basement would be nice<br />-the front dust filter sucks. it is removable, but i would much rather see something more like the PSU filter than the flimsy grate thing that sits behind the door.<br />-the fins on the top don't line up too well. again, at this price point I don't expect the mercedes of cases, but I would gladly pay more to see satisfyingly perfect alignment in the plastic bits.<br />-it looks great from far away, but once you start building in it, you notice that a lot of the parts are a bit cheap",

I did a lot of research, and this model had everything I needed (at the time) at an unbelievable price compared to other brands with the same specs.  The picture quality if wonderful, especially the HD channels on my cable.  Every time I'm in a store with HDTVs on display, none of them seem to compare to the great picture I get on my Soyo.<br /><br />However, I've just purchased a PS3, mainly for the Blu-ray player, and realized I wasn't getting full resolution because the TV resolution goes to 1080i only, but full Blu-ray needs 1080p.  I had bookmarked a review from 2006 saying there was really no reason to buy 1080p at that time, and I took that advise.  That's no longer the case.<br /><br />If you don't care about Blu-ray (the TV does an amazing job with regular DVDs), then this is probably still a great deal.<br /><br />As another reviewer mentioned, this model had an update somewhere along the way.

The sensation is a little unsettling at first but when you get used to it, you are rewarded with the ability to hear deep bass in your sounds without covering your ears completely the way ear buds and over-the-ear headphones require. They're not for everyone admittedly, but I love that I can feel/hear the sound and still be aware of my surroundings and able to respond if someone calls my name.<br />Good bone conducting headphones are easily 2x-3x the price of these, so keep that in mind. This is not going to be an alternative to a big name brand set. However, they aren't terrible either, and I kind of like them for the novelty of it at the price point.<br />If audio quality is your primary goal, understand that for the same money you can get a very decent pair of traditional headphones that will outshine this.

            "question": "title: Amazing for those with vision trouble!\ntext: I had decided I did not \"need\" a Kindle, having tons of other gadgets for all sorts of things. Then I began to lose the vision in one eye and realized over a period of weeks that I could not read normally (or at all some days). Magazines, books, the newspaper.... heck even email was difficult to impossible some days. All my friends have Kindles, so I borrowed one for a day and fell in love. We immediately ordered the Special Offers Wi-Fi Keyboard version. I've had it about 45 days now and my quality of life has seriously improved! I can enlarge the font and change the style of the font depending on my needs at that moment and on really bad days, when my eyes are tired or refusing to focus, the voice function is amazing. The very idea that it reads aloud to me is tremendous and once you adjust to the sometimes robotic pronounciation of some words, it works like a charm. So far, all the books I've purchased have allowed the voice option.<br /><br />I signed up for Audible.com about two weeks after getting the Kindle and the quality of the audio books on my Kindle is excellent. No robotic voice here - you get the narration exactly as read by the real person - it's an MP3 file I think. Additionally, getting the local newspaper every morning on my Kindle has returned to me my morning tradition of the local editorials & coffee. I do love the number of free books available as well - some are garbage, but most are pretty decent and some have been excellent books. (Loads of Sc-Fi for free too, what's not to love?) I have used the sample option for a ton of books and it's helped me decide to spend the money purchasing a novel, or not. In case you are worried about the Special Offers... they are the screensavers while the Kindle is in sleep mode and NEVER show up in your actual books. I've used a couple of them already now that I think about it.<br /><br />One last thing - the Kindle in a case, fits into almost all of my handbags and has saved my sanity sitting in doctor's office waiting rooms and at the car repair shop, and I can now sit out under a tree on a pretty day with my horses again while I read a great book. This version of the Kindle will also play my own music while I'm reading. Bottom line is that the Kindle has helped me get a valuable part of my life back and this in turn has allowed me to be more rational while facing possible permanent loss of vision in one eye. Very worthwhile purchase!",

It achieved a full charge in just over an hour.<br /><br />I removed the ear buds from the case, the right one first and then the left and they paired with each other immediately.  I went to my Bluetooth settings in my iPhone and found Haylou-GT1_R and my phone paired with the set with no issue.<br /><br />I was surprised at the sound quality these tiny ear buds deliver.  They can definitely be turned up as loud as you’d want to listen.  The bass, midtones and treble is on par for ear buds - even those that are much larger.<br /><br />I did figure out that the initial way I had them in my ears was upside down when I went to test the calling features.  The microphone needs to be pointed towards your mouth for best audio reception and sound quality improves a bit in this position.<br /><br />Call quality was excellent for both hearing the other person and them hearing you.<br /><br />In my testing the earbuds had no problem receiving within the 33’ stated range (actually making it to around 40’) and even received clearly through multiple walls - 2 rooms away with the doors closed and many obstacles in between.<br /><br />The only issue I struggled with was tapping the ear bud to stop / start the music and answer / end calls / activate voice assistant and skip tracks.  There is no button, you just tap an area of the exterior of the ear bud but you have to tap a very exact area which isn’t necessary easy to locate as it is not differentiated from the rest.  It would have been helpful if the manufacturer put a different texture in that area so you could feel it with your finger to locate it.<br /><br />While the manufacturers claims these last for 12 hours I found it was closer to 8 under normal use - still excellent.  And the case will charge them without it having to be plugged back in which is always a nice feature.<br /><br />These earbuds excelled in all of my tests showing that they are a high quality, dependable product.<br /><br />This is a set I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend.<br /><br />⭐️As with all Drew’s Reviews, if I discover something new about this product - good or bad - I will UPDATE my review.

Bought this new one through Amazon for $40 and it worked OK for a few months before it stopped transmitting internet as well.  So I bought a Linksys instead and there's a stark difference.  No more restarting my router every other day to get it to work, and NO MORE NETGEAR FOR ME!  There's a reason I guess why their routers are less expensive.  Do yourself a favor and pay the extra ten dollars for another brand like Linksys.<br /><br />If you do buy this one note that when I followed the instructions on the included setup CD it didn't work.  When I just did the setup manually it worked fine.  If you know anything at all about wireless routers then I suggest you set it up manually without the CD.",

            "question": "title: Worth every penny!!!\ntext: This LG soundbar is simply fantastic. It was easy to hook up physically and the app works great. I don’t know how often we’ll actually use the app, but I like having it as a backup option (our kids manage to lose remotes all the time!). Once we had the soundbar and sub hooked up, the technical portion of setting the sound set up and configurations took a while for my partner to get right. I thought the sound was amazing and beautiful, practically right out of the box. But my picky husband fussed around with the settings for a better part of an hour getting it just right. I’m kinda glad he did though because the sound quality went from “now this is nice” to mind blowingly “excellent!!!” We watch a lot of Disney and nature shows, and now it sounded like we’re right there. As if we’re sitting in a real movie theater or in the middle of the rainforest! The sound really is that impressively good.<br /><br />The only thing I didn’t love is the bar itself is a bit bigger than our old one (which is nearly 10 years old); so check the measurements if space is tight. I am sure I’ll get used to it in time. But the sub is quite small, so I can really hid this one! I think that is really nice. Overall, LG this set it looks modern and looks great in person. It works amazing well and we couldn’t be happier with it. I usually try not to comment on price, since what affordability is subjective. But I think this LG bar is worth it’s weight in gold.",

            "question": "title: USPS LLV Comparison: OontZ Angle 3 Plus vs Anker SoundCore\ntext: First off, I am not an audiophile. This is a review from a simple person who wanted music at work.<br /><br />I am a Rural Carrier for the United Stated Postal Service. I deliver mail in an LLV truck and these vehicles are basically mobile tin cans. Every panel rattles, making for quite an unpleasant environment, audio wise. I tried playing music directly off my phone, but alas my speakerphone is only so loud and is constantly drowned out by the LLV.<br /><br />So, I researched Bluetooth speakers and, based on the reviews and popularity, recently purchased two:<br />-[[ASIN:B016XTADG2 Anker SoundCore Bluetooth Speaker with 24-Hour Playtime, 66-Foot Bluetooth Range & Built-in Mic, Dual-Driver Portable Wireless Speaker with Low Harmonic Distortion and Superior Sound - Black]]<br />-[[ASIN:B01LZV6TYQ OontZ Angle 3 PLUS Splashproof Bluetooth Speaker - Designed & Engineered by Cambridge SoundWorks for Richer Bass, HD Sound, and 30-Hour Playtime, 10W+ Power, Water Resistant, Portable Wireless Speaker]]<br /><br />The Anker SoundCore is being returned while I am keeping the OontZ Angle 3 Plus and here is why.<br /><br />I tested both speakers in my home at first. My very first impression, out of the box:<br />OontZ Angle 3 Plus - was nice to touch and just felt solid and very well built.<br />Anker SoundCore - just felt like a simple lightweight brick. It really didn't give the impression of longevity or durability.<br /><br />The set-up guides were quite different from each other.<br />OontZ Angle 3 Plus - Extremely easy to read, follow and understand (remember, I am not a music nut lol. This was my first time ever using a Bluetooth speaker and was in completely uncharted territory.) It was all in English, and only English and the diagrams were detailed and made the entire set-up process seamless and carefree.<br />Anker SoundCore - This guide was very hard to follow. It is printed in darn near every language, in tiny print and the diagrams were quite small as well. I ultimately did get the speaker paired with my phone and figured out what buttons did what, but it took nearly 15 minutes to do so.<br /><br />Bluetooth Pairing<br />With both speakers and my phone lined up on a table (well within the proximity specified in each set-up guide), both speakers paired, however:<br />OontZ Angle 3 Plus - MUCH faster in pairing (mere seconds!).<br />Anker SoundCore - took nearly two minutes to complete the pairing process.<br /><br />Pause/Play Button<br />Since I dismount to deliver packages to a customer's door routinely on my route, I really need to have a simply way to pause my music. I really like how both speakers offer this function on directly on the units, saving me from having to handle my phone.<br />OontZ Angle 3 Plus - I barely press the Play/Pause button and the speaker immediately reacts. There is NO hesitation.<br />Anker SoundCore - I press the Play/Pause button and there is a delay of about 5 seconds.. just long enough to make me think I didn't press hard enough and reach to do it again only for the speaker to finally react.<br /><br />Volume/Overall Playback Quality<br />OontZ Angle 3 Plus - Wow. Just wow. It is truly unbelievable to hear such full sound, and bass(!), coming from such a small unit. I found myself perfectly pleased with the output without ever reaching max volume on the speaker itself. So I am looking forward to how well it will work in my LLV during my first road test. As for now, I am thoroughly impressed!<br />Anker SoundCore - I maxed out the volume on my phone and the speaker and was just not impressed. If I could guess, I'd say the max output this speaker achieved was only about 25% more than my speakerphone alone (while the OontZ Angle 3 Plus blew it out of the water with close to double, if not more, output than my speakerphone alone).<br />I also noted some kind of distortion or interference type background sound with the Anker SoundCore at mid volume and above.<br /><br />Speakerphone/Mic<br />I was able to answer an incoming phone call on both units as described in each set-up guide. The quality of in-call sound on each speaker differed:<br />OontZ Angle 3 Plus - My husband's (the caller) voice was crisp and clear, as if he was sitting talking right next to me. There was no distortion or feedback out of the speaker. Husband reported nothing but a clear voice on his phone.<br />Anker SoundCore - Husband's voice was clear, but echoed horribly. No matter what volume level I used. There was no distortion (I was expecting this given the distortion with the music playback) bu the continuous echoing is a major issue for me. Husband reported a slight &#34;faded&#34; type of echo on his phone.<br /><br />Road Test (in my LLV)<br />OontZ Angle 3 Plus - The sound is amazing in the truck! Thinking I would need it, I maxed the volume on both the speaker and my phone then pressed play on my music. Well, I certainly don't need max volume. I reduced the volume on both the speaker and my phone and found a very happy medium output. This speaker performs perfectly in the loud, rattling setting of a USPS LLV.. even while bouncing down rural dirt two tracks and washboard gravel roads. I am extremely pleased with this tiny speaker.<br />Anker Soundcore - Even with maxed volume settings, I could not get this speaker to perform anywhere near as well as the OontZ Angle 3 Plus. It had volume and was loud enough to hear over the vehicle's own noise, however the distortion/interference mentioned earlier was still present and in the truck during the road test it had what I would describe as an echoing effect on the music, specifically the singers' voices. It just wasn't clear. (I hope that makes sense.)<br /><br />Battery Life/Listen While Charging<br />OontZ Angle 3 Plus - So far, the battery life is impressive. After receiving it, I charged it overnight (as recommended). I then had it connected to my phone for about an hour of home testing. Turned it off and I next used it at work on a Saturday.. had it powered on and connected to my phone and actively playing music for about 5.5 hours. I then used it again on Monday (much longer and busier days in the USPS, FYI).. had it on, connected and active continuously for nearly 9 hours. I have yet to see the low battery light come on. I plan to see just how many days of work I can get out of a single charge.<br />Anker Soundcore - I have no information for this section on this speaker since I am returning it.<br /><br />Exterior/Cleaning<br />At first, I had the OontZ Angle 3 Plus setting on the dashboard of the LLV. This didn't last more than two stops. Despite having the four rubber &#34;feet&#34;, the speaker still slid around causing more of a distraction than I would like. I ended up setting it on top of my personal bag, in a bin by my feet with the speaker facing up. This move really helped my piece of mind, knowing it will not go anywhere. This speaker has a soft rubber exterior. It is quite nice and feels luxurious, however... this exterior attracts all dust particles within 50 feet! USPS LLVs are *not* known for being the cleanest and even though I moved the speaker from the dust-ridden dashboard to a bin, it was still slathered with dust and dirt by the end of my route. I figured it was a fair trade, sacrificing the appearance for the gain of having decent music. But.. I got home and went to clean it. I will tell you, my expectations of this working were very low. I didn't think the dust would come off that supple rubber. But with a wet paper towel and a few slow wipes, it did. So, it can be cleaned up!<br /><br />Case<br />I did purchase the case for this speaker ([[ASIN:B01NBDY6VP [Official] OontZ Angle 3 Plus Bluetooth Portable Speaker Carry Case, Neoprene with Aluminum Carabiner, reinforced zipper, by Cambridge SoundWorks [NOT FOR OontZ Angle 3]]]). I was mainly wanting a safe way to transport and store the speaker, but after reading the other reviews I was hoping I would be able to keep it clean in the case and still enjoy my music on my route. I received the case and used it yesterday. The case is extremely nice and I appreciate the interior mesh pocket. I have no need for it now, but I'm sure it will come in handy if I ever take this speaker on vacation and need to take the charging cables along. As for playback while in the case? Yeah, it was terribly muffled. It didn't work for me as it apparently has for others. Yet, the case itself is exactly what I was wanting for taking it to and from work. It is not as thickly padded as I would have expected, however it does protect the speaker.<br /><br />Overall, for my specific purpose and intended use for a Bluetooth speaker, the Anker SoundCore simply won't cut it. However, it is still a nice speaker and will perhaps fit your needs perfectly. After all, most people don't drive LLVs and have the same high demands that go along with that. For me, the OontZ Angle 3 Plus is what I'll be bopping down the road to, mailbox to mailbox.<br /><br />Happy hunting! Hope this review helps you out!",

            "question": "title: Fantastic Radio\ntext: To mention right off the bat, I am not even an amateur radio operator, just someone who enjoys radio. I find radio to be far more romantic and compelling than modern methods of broadcasting. Staying up late in the night and turning the dial with the soft glow of the tuner, the sound of static and mystery that can sometimes accompany radio broadcasts offers something truly genuine that you can't get anywhere else today. That feeling is priceless and not duplicable (If that was even a word).<br /><br />Anyway, this radio is good quality and contains the capability needed to reach further than most others. If you enjoy radio as I do, a clock radio, ghetto blaster or home stereo won't cut it. If you know what I am talking about, then this radio is for you. I've stayed up many nights listening to Coast to Coast AM on the internet, but it lacked the feeling something like this radio will bring you. I was unable to pick up a station on my home stereo to listen to CTC and was forced to use the internet. The internet provided a clear, stereo sounding broadcast and was very clear.<br /><br />The CC Radio has been spoken about on the program for many years. I finally picked one up and am very pleased with it's performance. I can now pick up the radio broadcast of Coast to Coast AM and with all the nuances I expect of a a late night radio broadcast. When interesting speakers talk about compelling topics, a crystal clear internet broadcast does not move you inside. However, using the CC Radio, the slight static, the slight fading in and out and all other fantastic experiences you can only receive using a real radio, it has the ability to make you feel and even send chills up your spine. There is just something a good solid radio can do for you that nothing else can and the CC Radio delivers on that 100%.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed and I really need to get my license.",

            "question": "title: These won me over\ntext: Prior to receiving this review sample I was happy with in-ear type phones, but always grabbed headphones when I wanted to listen to music without disturbing others, These phones changed that.  For one thing they are super comfortable. For another the sound is incredible. In fact I have been testing various phones - mainly from this brand, but also some Sennheiser models - and this is head and shoulders above the pack.<br /><br />I'll be honest and disclose that comfort edges out sound when phones sound good enough. I will normally not quibble over a few hundred Hz one way or the other as long as I can wear the phones without noticing them. These are not only unobtrusive, but downright comfortable, which is a major reason why these have now replaced my trusty [[ASIN:B00ENZRS76 Brainwavz HM9 Hi-Fi Noise Isolating Headphones]].<br /><br />Soundwise the specs do not begin to describe the richness, especially bass. In fact, when I read the 20 Hz to 20 MHz range I thought that the sound would be somewhat generic for phones in this range. I own a pair of IEMs (in-ear monitors) that go as low as 18 Hz at the same 95dB at 1mW sensitivity, yet these sound much deeper than those. I love the balance of sound across the frequency spectrum as though it's on a smooth continuum. Every one of my test albums I played through these phones sounded so good that I decided that it's time to hang up the headphones and go with these.<br /><br />Part of the reason why I love these from a comfort perspective is the over the ear memory wire. I prefer that style, but not everyone does. They are definitely stiff and take on a shape that will be uniquely yours over time (and a very short time at that!) Also, while this ships with a [[ASIN:B00HPPL1M4 Brainwavz Hard Earphone Case]] the phones will not fit after you have contoured them to your ear. The case is useful for carrying around the array of adapters and tips that are included. In fact, the final reason I love these phones is the included triple-flange style silicon tips, which block out the rest of the world and allow me to focus solely on music.<br /><br />If you love music and want to hear every note faithfully reproduced in their natural frequencies these phones are it. I can honestly say that I have not used a better set of phones from any brand in this price range, including some Sennheiser models that have a street price of fifty to seventy-five dollars more than these, so the value is definitely there.",

            "question": "title: Effortless performance\ntext: Just a phenomenal cpu.  This is probably the best upgrade Ive done, coming from an i7 7700k. I had 30 days to use and figure out if I wanted to stay with this or go with the latest AMD cpu.<br /><br />Work- I used to have trouble running programs that were either too complex or inefficiently coded that it led to stutters, hitches, delays or freezes.  One program that always caused massive trouble for me over the years was the Think or Swim trading platform.  I originally upgraded to the i7 7700k and it could not handle more than 2-3 chart at a time running the time and sales and L2.  Run some side charts and you could forget about trading, especially at the open when calculations need to be run at an extremely rapid pace.  I even added a total of 32gb ddr4 3400 ram and it still wouldnt run properly.  Arguably, the program is encoded really inefficiently requiring much more from the CPU than necessary.  Ive tried many different trading programs and this one caused the most trouble.  After stepping up to the i9 9900k I can now run this inefficiently encoded program on my main chart screen, with two different tickers having 4 different time frames each with its own L2 and time and sales, PLUS 15 side charts without a hitch! Also im running my browser with at least 5 tabs open and video/audio running.  Absolutely amazing.  I never thought I could get it to work like this.<br /><br />Gaming- even if the cpu doesnt run at 100 pct it affects the quality of the experience of the gameplay, especially for demanding games, or just poorly coded, inefficient ones.  RPGs fall into these categories. I.e., Kingdom Come Deliverance.  Video and streaming is flawless as well.<br /><br />Vs AMD- Performance isnt always about raw numbers, if there are too many peaks and valleys, it affects the quality of the experience.  I havent personally compared it directly to the newest AMD cpu, but having looked at the side by side comparisons, AMD cpu seems to put out better numbers for work-related applications, but clearly on the gaming side, intel is superior.  From my observation, the quality of the experience with Intel was greater because the frame rate was consistent with much less, if any micro stuttering, which you can see with the AMD chips.  As a result, Intel's presentation was more effortless and smooth.  With the AMD setup, you can see some graying/discoloring/hazy effects in demanding scenes.  It seems like AMD is an overcharged chip that experiences these dips because of that, causing a deterioration in the experience. AMD is perfectly fine for work I presume, but not for me when it comes to gaming. Intel performs like a more refined, polished product.  This is just based on my personal observation of their performance in these two different areas.<br /><br />Overclocking- its perfectly fine using it the way it is.  No need to overclock, but of course you can overclock it.  I run mine 16 hours a day without any problems. Top recommendation at the asking price these days.",

So I drilled pilot holes and screwed in by hand.  The screws are made of a fairly soft metal, and several stripped out even after drilling a bigger pilot hole. It would be nice if they used some sort of mounting bracket that you could mount with a drill, then snap these into place.  As it is, they probably work OK for softer desks, but maybe not the best choice for a really dense wood.",

I downloaded a 3rd party migration/cloning software and that didnt work either. I tried nearly everything I could for 1.5 days!  I even tried backing up/restoring manually and then repairing. Nothing worked. It was a complete waste of time. I didnt even learn anything in the process other than learning that I should go with a company that has a readily available comprehensive solution that doesn't needlessly waste your valuable time.  1.5 days down the drain.<br /><br />So I ended up migrating my Samsung 1tb NVME to a new Samsung 2tb NVME and it couldnt have been any easier. &lt; 15 minutes, very quick!  I previously, migrated from a corsair SSD to Samsung 1tb NVME (when i couldnt get another SSD to migrate properly), and that was flawless as well. Why didnt I initially go with the Samsung 2tb instead of WD? Press had positive news about it.  I am not a fanboy so I like to try different solutions.  That was a mistake.  What's apparent to me after this experience is that Samsung is better than all their competitors at providing a comprehensive package of the best hardware and software.  The experience is FLAWLESS.  I havent had any issues with any of their storage solutions to date.<br /><br />Why did I bother writing this review? Because I wasted 1.5 days. Something has to come out of it. Maybe itll help someone or maybe WD will get their act together and work on their cloning/migration software because the hardware seems to be fantastic.<br /><br />Disclosure, I bought and paid for everything myself and I still own HDs/SSDs/MicroSds by WD (only old HDs), Sandisk (microsds, ssds), Seagate (HD), Samsung (SSDs, Micro SDs and NVMEs).",

I selected this one because I like cables with braided insulation and so far this one has worked out well for me.<br /><br />This is a 6' cable which is just about right for my needs. It is long enough to reach my devices when I have it plugged into my USB brick on my desk without requiring rearrangement of everything on my desk just to make it fit. Longer would be handy but unnecessary, but shorter would make it a lot less useful for me.<br /><br />I have not used it for data transfer, just charging up devices, and so far it has worked out well in that capacity. The connection is snug and I have not noticed any particular difference in charging speeds between this cable and the OEM cables that came with my devices.<br /><br />I am especially pleased with the build quality. The cable is stiff (as to be expected) and it should hold up for a long time against kinks and twists. The junctions where the cable goes into the plastic casings for the connectors are tight and allow no play which is a big plus for me as these are the spots where I have had cables fail most often. Overall, I am not unhappy with the build quality.<br /><br />This is a decent third-party USB-C cable that works very well for me. It is made well and it does a fine job charging my devices.

They also tend to overstate their resolving power, claiming to send a 1080 sized image that looks more like an upscaled 480. I'm happy to say this is a degree better than those!<br />The sensor is still small, as expected, but the optics aren't super wide to the point that edges distort. In fact, it seems pretty rectilinear (straight lines stay relatively straight in the background). The resolution seems decent as well. I'm not sure if it's actually resolved a full HD image like it claims, but it is definitely more resolution than a lot of the cheaper webcams I've tried. It looks pretty good and I'd argue that any live web call, skype, zoom, etc, will look perfectly fine with this camera and play at whatever resolution that protocol is capable of clearly.<br />The thing that sorta disappointed me, however, was the \"ring light\" built in. I mean, I have a REAL ring light so I get what that should do, but this sorta does... nothing. It doesn't create soft shadows or a circular catch light in my eyes- in fact, it's very hard to discern the difference between capture with the light on versus off. In a dark room, it can add a bit of illumination to the subject to make you a little easier to see, but it really isn't all that bright and under normal lighting conditions in my office, it makes zero difference at all. It also seems to get kind of warm as long as it is plugged in, even if not currently active, so I'm going to be in the habit of disconnecting it when not using, and only plugging it in when I need to make a video call at my desk.<br />For what it is, it is definitely a better webcam than most of the cheap ones, but it definitely is not perfect!",

The connector bases are reinforced at each end of the wire which really help hold all of the wires in place even if you have to bend and twist it to fit it within the plug.<br /><br />One area where this cable could use improvement is the plug hood lacks a protective rubber boot guard that protects the clip on the plug - this becomes very important when snaking the cable through walls and tight spaces.  Due to not having this feature it is critical to wrap the boot and plug with a small piece of electrical tape to make sure not to unintentionally snag anything as the cable is being snaked.<br /><br />I love the grey PVC shielding on this cable - not only is it waterproof, durable and will help the cable withstand damage but it can be run along a wall and then painted to match the wall color.<br /><br />I used this 65 foot cable to run between a PoE switch and an external security camera, this cable supplies power and transmits data to and from that security cameras - after thoroughly testing this cable over the last 3 months I’ve been nothing but impressed by this product.<br /><br />This has proven to be an outstanding, dependable Ethernet Cable - this is really a top of the line cable that you’ll love.<br /><br />This is a purchase that you’ll never regret.  I’ve been utilizing two ZOSI cables for a3 months now and I’ve had nothing but outstanding results from them.<br /><br />This is definitely a brand and product I recommend.",

You can’t get these cameras to monitor and record motion triggered clips that you can review whenever needed without putting them in “armed” mode which means that it will want to send you an alert every time the cat farts. You can mute the alerts for a max of 4hrs at a time, but that’s obviously not long enough for someone who isn’t interested in being on high alert. Also, they don’t want to save your clips without you paying for subscribed services. If Tend wasn’t always out of stock when I checked, I’d prefer them.",

It's amazing how difficult it was to find something like that that fit my needs, and I ended up with this unit although I really wasn't intrested in the iPhone/iPod connections.  I went to a local electronics store and first tried a litte Sony machine, was set to buy it, and then the salesman showed me this Phillips unit.  The sound was overwhelmingly better on the Phillips unit.  I admit I'm not an audiophile, but I just want something that sounds good when I played CDs at bedtime.  I quickly dismissed the little Sony and went for this unit.  Since having it about a week now, I really like the sound from the CD player.  I did try my iPhone 4 on it to see if it would connect, and it did and it played music like a champ.  Strong and clear.  I have a rubber bumper on my iPhone and had to remove it to make the phone fit properly but that's no big deal.  In fact what I'm thinking of doing is reprogramming my older iPhone (first generation) with nothing but music on it and leaving that plugged in the Phillips unit.  I keep my iPhone 4 in a different charger in a different room so it doesn't disrupt my sleep AND so I won't forget it when I'm leaving the house.  So far I'm a happy camper with this little Philips unit.  The only con is the brightness of the backlit display which is rather bright.  I placed the unit in a different part of the room where the remote still works but the brightness of the display doesn't affect my sleep.  I like a dark room!",

            "question": "title: Decent Basic Player; Minor Odd Behaviors\ntext: The last Blu-Ray player I owned bit the dust about a month after we got it and I have been quietly looking for another one to replace it. I was given the opportunity to try this one and I took it. It's not a bad player and it seems to work, but there are a couple of behaviors about it that I do not like.<br /><br />It is as simple a player as it gets. It's not fancy and it doesn't do a lot of extras beyond basic player functions - pause, play, eject, skip, etc. At the end of the day it's all that's needed. It connects via HDMI which is fine, and the resolution and picture size can be tweaked in the menu system which is good. Playback is fine and I have had no issues with picture quality.<br /><br />There are two things about this player that bother me, both of which are annoyances but neither are deal breakers. First, when the unit is powered on it asks for the user to set the language and voice prompting. That's fine the first time. But, this player does it every time it is powered on again and that gets irritating. Second, when a disc is put in and playback starts, there's a very brief hesitation in the sound within the first 10 seconds of playback. This hesitation is just enough to notice, and then it's gone, almost like it skips a quarter-second of sound or something. It doesn't happen again until an eject operation and a disc is inserted again. I have observed this with multiple discs.<br /><br />There is no HDMI cable in the box. Keep that in mind when you buy - you'll need to either have a cable already or you'll have to buy one separately.<br /><br />This is not a bad player and so far it is working better than our previous Blu-Ray player. It sticks to the basics and it gets them right. There are a couple of minor odd behaviors that bug me a little but at the asking price I can overlook those.",

            "question": "title: Low battery and camera shuts off with NO WARNING\ntext: Problem #1: Camera eats up normal AAA Energizer batteries quickly.  Maybe get 5 pictures and then it quits. Change to AAA Lithium Entergizer Batteries. Now, you are OK. The sensor on the camera trips just after a few underwater photos.<br /><br />Size, and functionality seems comfortably nice. Not too technical to get started using this camera. Found this camera a great first step for beginners who want to document their scuba dives, take photos on surface, on the boat, on the shore, etc.  But, hold on... when you want to go scuba diving:<br /><br />Problem #2: Does not have an underwater setting for diffused lighting. Only Flowers and Landscapes. What dah? Is this not for underwater use? Hello! All of my underwater photos could have improved by 100 percent if there was a setting for underwater lighting.  The sunny days at the shore, boat photos, trees and countryside photos, ok.  These were nice, the detail in the landscape photos were good. You can even use the camera without its plastic shell.  The protective casing makes this an excellent choice as a first step scuba camera.  But, how are the photos underwater? This is a $100 camera, so  please do not expect high quality photos from your squid, lobster, or grouper ... posing for you underwater, even at 25 feet.  This makes a great first step camera, getting your feet wet with underwater photography.<br /><br />Problem #3: strap holder is on right side only (for right hand use.)  Better if there was a strap holder on both sides, for those who need on left hand side (underwater.) Why?  My first hand experience is that you want to use this point and shoot camera using either your right hand or your left hand.  Not both.  This camera is a quick shot camera, not \"oh, wait a minute, pose, look this way, now smile, ok, cheese ...\"  This camera sits on your right hand or left hand while diving.  Now, if you see that nice fish, and want to take a picture, you try with one hand.  If the strap is on the wrong side, it blocks your ability to use the left hand to hold the camera.  So, this camera is ONLY FOR RIGHT HANDED folks. But, do not let go of the camera underwater, you may loose it.  Right?  Not really.  Nice thing about this basic camera is that it float to surface (rather than sink into the bottom.) Wow, did that save me a few times. Dropped off my wrist.  Then floated for a few feet, and I got it back.  If it sunk down 300 Feet, I could have kissed this baby --- good bye.<br /><br />I have taken about 50 surface images, and 50 underwater images, using this Intova.  All 50 surface photos, with reasonable sunlight, were excellent considering this camera.  Of the 50 photos underwater images, about 10 were acceptable, the other 40 were blurry and not acceptable.  Yeah,  I had to spend another 15 minutes per each of the 10 photos to convert the poor colors into something more exciting, adding RED, adding CONTRAST, adding BRIGHTNESS using a photo editor.  But, I did get 10 acceptable underwater photos. And that was great.  Really Great.  These photos were generally above 25 feet.<br /><br />Scuba divers need to know the difficulty of taking photos underwater while attempting to swim around reefs, wrecks, squid, lobster and other photographers. Buy this camera as a first step.  Just correct that battery issue, take lots of pictures, and learn the responsibility of underwater photography is the PERSON BEHIND THE CAMERA.  For $100, not bad, eh?",

            "question": "title: Fine Two-Pack of Cables\ntext: If you own an iPhone, iPad or one of the newer iPods you are familiar with the need for lightning cables. These are basically special USB cables that are reversible and are specific to Apple electronics. The problem with these cables is that they can be expensive, especially if you go with Apple-branded cables. There are some good third-party cables available, and they represent a good value when compared to Apple cables. I get offered a LOT of lightning cables for review and I have noticed an unpleasant trend: most vendors hawking their cables to not mention MFI certification at all, anywhere, and this is important. This particular cable is clearly marked in the description as certified, so it is worth some consideration on that basis alone when compared to many of the others available.<br /><br />These come in a two-pack, and they are a little more than 3’ in length. These have hard plastic plugs on the end and the length is insulated with a vinyl sheath for protection. So far these have shown no signs of fatigue at the plugs and they work very well. I have been able to charge my phone as well as connect it to iTunes. I attempted to pull the shielding away from the plug and was unable to do so, so I see no risk of exposing the wires inside the casing.<br /><br />I mentioned the certification above, and I will restate that this is a very important feature. Because these cables are certified, they are guaranteed compatible and will work. If you use a cable that is not certified you might get messages on your phone or tablet that the cable is unrecognized and it might not work as desired. I have worked with non-certified cables and sometimes they work while others do not work at all. I have never had a certified cable fail me.<br /><br />If you are looking for a less expensive alternative to Apple-branded cables, make sure you select a product that has been certified to work. This two pack of cables is a good choice; so far, they have given me no trouble at all and they have worked well for me. They are definitely compatible and are made well too. And, getting two of them instead of just one in the package means you can have one in the office and one at home.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at minimal or no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.",

            "question": "title: Reliable, no-frills tablet for folks on a budget\ntext: I received this as a review sample and have been using it for a little less than a week. At the time of this review this tablet is shipping with Android 4.4.4. Before I dive into what I like and why I rated it so highly I want to set expectations.<br /><br />This DOES NOT come with bluetooth, and the screen and cameras are not especially spectacular. The screen is readable (easily so) and has nice, vivid colors. However compared to even my Note 3 phone it falls short. As the cameras, for some reason tablet makers seem to skimp on those as though they are an afterthought.<br /><br />Since there is no bluetooth you are stuck with the internal speaker or using phones. The internal speaker is not what I would call optimum for listening to music, but the included phones are surprisingly decent. I also connected one of my bluetooth speakers that accepts 3.5mm input and the sound was excellent, so while this does not have bluetooth, you can still stream music to it.<br /><br />Another thing it does not have is bloatware that every other tablet (and phone) seems to  be plagued with. That is one of the reasons why I rated this so highly. But the real reason why I gave this tablet five stars is price. At the time of this review it is selling for sixty bucks, which is not a bad deal for an entry level tablet - especially if you want to browse the web, stream music or wile away the day on facebook.<br /><br />It is a complete package that includes a stylus, soft bag, charger and cable, and OTG adapter. The latter allows you to connect USB peripherals to the micro USB charging port. I tested it with a keyboard, then a mouse and it recognized both. The USB charging port is another thing I like - it;s a micro USB type, which is a major improvement over some entry level tablets that I have tested that use a non-standard barrel connector.<br /><br />You can add a 32GB SD card using a TF adapter. I tested it with an old SanDisk Ultra 32GB MicroSDHC Class 10 UHS Memory Card that was immediately recognized. The application manager allows you to move some apps to the SD card, so as you add your favorites some will be eligible for running off an external card (depending on the app, of course.) Browsing the web, using Google's location feature and maps, and Youtube all performed with no lag or issues. In fact I would put the performance head-to-head against my Verizon Ellipsis 7 4G LTE Tablet, Black 7-Inch 8GB tablet. Do note, though, that if you have all services turned on and are constantly using this tablet you are going to get about 2.5 to 3 hours of use time if you are not connected to a charger. For some folks that may be a deal breaker, so take that into account.<br /><br />Basically this is a stripped down, but very functional tablet for folks on a budget. If you can live without bluetooth and will be using it near a power source it's a decent tool (or toy, depending on your outlook) at an affordable price, It is a perfect first tablet for someone who also has an Android phone, and is definitely useful for folks addicted to the web.",

            "question": "title: Exactly what I expected--maybe a little better, even.\ntext: I spent a long time hmmming and hawing over this purchase. I really wanted the OEM Panasonic case for my LX7, but at $65 here on Amazon, it was just too expensive. I compared the aftermarket cases for this camera and examined photographs closely. This was the winner for apparent quality and design. And it lived up to expectations.<br /><br />I was worried that it would block some of the screen or controls in the back, but this is not an issue at all. This case fits almost perfectly (screw mount is slightly out of alignment with the hole on the bottom of the camera--but it works), and is of as high-quality materials as one can imagine, given that this is *not* a leather case. The prospective purchaser should be aware that the vast majority of the cases on Amazon for the LX7 are not real leather. You can tell a case is real leather on here if it costs a fortune. The real leather cases on Amazon are all >$50, and some are $100+.<br /><br />For $15, this case represents an excellent value, as it fits pretty well, is well-made (sturdier than I expected!), and looks very nice. (I have the white LX7 and I bought the light brown case--the color of a well-worn baseball glove). One thing: as expected, the strap is made of vinyl, and looks it. I will likely be upgrading to a proper, padded camera strap though, so this is of little import, at least to me.<br /><br />If you are on the fence, take my advice and go for it. This is a good value, and a decent case--especially for this price. I did, and I have no regrets.<br /><br />Note: you will have to remove the case to access the battery/SD card compartment and the ports, as is the norm with all cases of this type for this camera (I was unable to find one that did not require this).<br /><br />---<br /><br />UPDATE: After several months of hard use, this case has held up remarkably well. No evidence of wear. I get compliments on it, as well. Note: Do not attach the camera to a tripod with the bottom of the case on. The knob on the case is threaded to allow you to do this, but getting it off the tripod mount afterwards is a nightmare. Just take it out of the case--trust me.",

My favorite to this day is how intelligent the lighting is on the buttons; lift them slightly and the lights turn on, but remain off when lying still for a while.<br /><br />I haven't used the voice features after the initial night, so I can't comment on that. Everything still works great, and overall I find the button configuration pretty intuitive. I still confuse the Exit and Last buttons sometimes, so maybe some tweaking could be used between those two (if there hasn't been yet). But the main issue I have is how the power buttons don't work properly. When turning on both box and TV, the TV will turn on but the X1 box won't. It's been like that with two TVs. And when powering them off the TV will turn off but the box won't. I have to manually turn it off, which is a step more than I'd like but I've adjusted.",

            "question": "title: Good Hardware, Not-So-Good Setup\ntext: I work a lot with smart watches but this is the first health monitor/GPS watch I have used. I was excited to have the<br />opportunity to work with it, and I was hopeful that it would be a good unit. Epson is a brand I know well from their printers, so out of the gate I had some expectations. This watch has proven to be a mixed bag.<br /><br />I will start with what I believe are the strongest features. This watch has a much better-than-average charger. Many watches I have used have a magnetic charger that is either poorly constructed or will not stay on the device it'’s charging. This one, however, is a clamp-based charger that does a good job of holding the watch even under its own weight without letting it slip or shift. I would have liked to see other manufacturers adopt this kind of charging clamp.<br /><br />The battery lasts for a very long time. I charged it up completely and after taking it from the charger I deliberately left it on the shelf to drain. It's rated for 20 hours, and I assume that is for active use. Letting it sit idle, it lasted two weeks for me. It of course drains much faster when it is actively being used so once I started using it I had to charge it again. This is a handy data point if you're traveling - if you're going for a weekend, it holds enough charge to get through in most cases, and if you are an infrequent user it will retain a charge for a while.<br /><br />The display is very clear and easy to read. I have had no issues at all with the display and I am very pleased with how easy on the eyes it is.<br /><br />One of the issues I have with most wrist-wear of any kind is getting it to fit properly. I have large hands and wrists, and I found this watch to be a bit snug on even the loosest setting. This is par for the course for me. I was hopeful it would fit a bit better, but it wasn't to be.<br /><br />The aggravation started when I set up the software and paired the watch to my phone. The Bluetooth pairing did not go smoothly and I tried several times to get it straight. I finally switched over to setting it up through the watch instead of through the phone, and I was able to get it working and connected. While this is an acceptable work-around for someone with patience, it is an aggravation for someone who prefers things to just work the way they're supposed to.<br /><br />I will say I am not especially impressed with the software app. I think it is a little too overly complex and counter-intuitive, but it does work and it has a lot of features. It does a good job of tracking progress.<br /><br />So, aside from setup and fit, how does it work? It seems to work well. I am very familiar with sport GPS units so I assumed this one would work about the same, and it does. It acquires the satellites and uses those to report position back to the phone app so you can track yourself. This is useful when you want to see where you went and how far. The speed of acquisition of the satellites seems to be roughly the same as with my hand-held units. The heart rate monitor seems to be good and in measuring manually for comparison it appears to be accurate. The step feature is a good quick measurement and is sufficient to replace a dedicated pedometer.<br /><br />Overall this is a decent health watch, but there's some room for improvement. It looks great, it works well and it's easy to read. It is hampered by less-than-idea setup and software, and it would be nice if it fit a little better.",

I like this speaker, it sounds good, it plays loud and since I use it 12 hours a week I generally get a year or two out of it before it breaks.

In fact, it even seems to come with the original Nougat firmware- usually a phone that has been used recently would have been upgraded to Oreo already.<br />Only problem is that I was looking for a version that would work with T-mobile, and while this handset is unlocked from Verizon, it doesn't work as well as an actual T-mobile branded would be (that's the H918 model). So sadly, I have to return this gem of a phone and get the one with the correct bands and software for my needs. Its a shame, I wish I could keep it.

If the battery starts to go or you need more power than a stock one offers, you can easily replace them and get BIGGER capacity ones. IR blaster, second screen display (which is really neat!)

For that purpose this is an excellent deal and all the tripod one needs. For SLR cameras like my Canon T7i, this would be OK (and merely OK) as a table top tripod with the legs fully retracted. It wobble too much otherwise. For me this is all I need. Had I purchased for my camera it would have been returned. Bottom line: if you need to mount a stationary device or use it as a tabletop tripod you will love it and the price. Otherwise I recommend spending a few extra bucks and getting a tripod that is sturdier.",

The number one problem with mine is that the heart rate monitor does not accurately measure heart rate, or even close.  After 15-20 minutes of running, the readings fluctuated wildly.  At first it was 120, then 131, then a few seconds later 85!  I tried looser and tighter band settings, and also tried rotating the watch to position the sensor on different areas of my wrist (to detect pulse better), and it still never worked correctly.  I'm not sure if mine is just defective, or this product is poorly designed.  There are also a few other minor issues, such as the dull screen (see photo - very hard to read when outdoors) and also my device has randomly shut off a few times.  Overall, I would not recommend this product for anyone.  It's too bad, though, because the design is nice (as is the price) and the bluetooth connectivity and software work well.",

            "question": "title: What is the purpose of this device?\ntext: My AT&T/Direct TV salesman talked me into buying this worthless overpriced junk to somehow enable voice commands for my DirectTV remote (they are about the only tv service that has a remote without it).  Didn't work.  3 IT people in the family worked on it for over 2 hours just to get it connected to the Internet.  The only instructions I found on the Internet about using it to voice control my remote basically required \"hacking\" and reprogramming the Echo.  So gave up on that and cancelled by Direct TV service to go back to my old service that had voice commands and a wonderful search engine built right into the remote.  We did get it to stream music - and it sounded like a scratchy LP. So I have to buy expensive speakers for that? I'm out of table space for all of this and hate ugly cords running everywhere.  I'll just stick a CD in my DVD player or computer and listen to the music I want to listen to.  Siri on my iPhone has a better search engine.  It seems like every device you want to connect to (and I really don't want to connect it to anything - I simply don't care) costs more money for special equipment that will work with the Echo.  Spent HOURS of research on the internet trying figure out it's vague instructions.  The only time I need a smart anything is when I'm in my car and need directions - Siri does that quite well most of the time and I don't need to buy anything else.  In my home I have two computers, my iPhone and television.  All are pretty smart and keep me well informed on news and weather.  I have enough noise in my life - I don't need a device that just adds scratchy noise.  As far as music streaming Sirius is a huge waste of money so I stopped that service and decided my hundreds of CD's and/or an MP3 player can play all the music I want to hear.  I don't need any more complications in my life and I'm sick of trying to get devices to talk to each other - and the echo is the worst example of this.",

I've tried other products from dry cloths, to alcohol rubs, to my t-shirt, nothing else comes close to clearning so thoroughly. One cloth is plenty!!<br /><br />They may see a little too dry to work when you are first using them. Don't worry. They are the perfect moistness.<br /><br />A trick. One side of the cloth is more rough than the other. Use the rough side to clear the phone screen. It works much better than the smoother side.<br /><br />I fold the cloth in half so there are two of these rough sides. I use one side to do the initial cleaning and the other side to do the final - perfection clean.<br /><br />Then, I fold the cloth inside out to clean off my finger tips before discarding the cloth.<br /><br />A suggestion - could you make a biodegradable wrapper?<br /><br />The price varies between 10 and 17 cents.

I have a wireless media remote keyboard that I used to use with an HTPC that needs a USB dongle, and wanted to also take advantage of the wired Ethernet jack I had previously installed by my TV (wired is always more reliable for streaming in our experience). This device seemed perfect! It connects to the power socket of the Fire stick and offers a USB hub with ethernet jack.<br />The problem is, the ethernet jack doesn't seem to be recognized by the Firestick at all! I know what it is supposed to do when it recognizes a network jack, but the option to use the wired internet simply doesn't show up- it doesn't know or acknowledge it is there!<br />On the upside, at least the USB sockets work, so I was able to use my media remote keyboard. In fact, this device comes in two parts- one is a USB host plug that allows a single USB connection while passing power, and a standard USB hub + ethernet that attaches to that. In all honestly, if I just want to use the USB media remote, I don't need the hub... I can plug it directly into the host port without the hub attached. Its a shame because I really want ethernet.

It is easy to set up if you're familiar with normal router setup procedures (connect to its wifi or via ethernet cable, then access the router configuration through a browser).  It will normally create a wifi SSID that's different from your original wifi, but you can just force it to use the same name.<br /><br />For my phones and computers, I use my 5G wifi network but the older 2.4 Ghz is great for home automation products such as switches, doorbells, and cameras.

            "question": "title: Fantastic battery life.\ntext: These are my first wireless ear buds. I've got a couple of $100+ IEMs, the Sony WH-1000X M3, and Audio-Technica over-the-ear headphones. I think I've got a good sense of under-$500 sound quality, and these Technics are slightly overpriced in my opinion, but they still sound fanstastic.<br />I have smaller ear canals than normal (as told by my audiologist), so I always opt for a size down when trying on tips. I followed the instructions to insert these Technics buds into my ear holes with the smaller tips, and they fit great. They don't come out with vigorous head-shaking, and haven't come out during my work commutes. I walk about half an hour a day, and so far so good.<br /><br />The ear buds pair easily, and they always connect to my phone when I take them out of the case. I tried the noise-canceling, but found it to be sub-par compared to my Sony headphones. Sony actually sucks out the volume outside; these Technics add a white noise filter, which to me obstructs the audio I'm listening to. There's an app you can download to your phone which turns off the white-noise filter, so I did that, and turned of equalizer settings. On my phone I use Poweramp v3, AntennaPod, and Amazon Prime HD. They all sound great, but, because the Technics don't slide all the way into my ear, some of the bass gets lost. Higher volumes help, but then you run into ear damage.<br /><br />Overall, I'm pleased with my first set of wireless ear buds. While they won't take over my Shure IEMs, they're super convenient to have during my work commutes.",

The clever Velcro interior can be rearranged in any number of configurations; there is room for two camera bodies and numerous lenses, along with a built-in laptop pouch, memory cards, and ample side pockets. It also comes with a rain cover. You can use the bag as a roller bag (preferable) or as a backpack.

            "question": "title: Inexpensive solution for upgrading some older vehicles\ntext: I received this as a free review sample. Since Vince McLaren's exceptionally helpful review of August 21, 2016 covers what I also discovered, take the time to read his (and mark it helpful because he did an excellent job.)<br /><br />It took me a few weeks to get around to writing this review because I needed to order an adapter for the 1998 Ford Explorer it was destined for, and also to have it professionally installed. The adapter I purchased is [[ASIN:B01ES32D7C Fits Ford Explorer 1998-2001 Double DIN Stereo Harness Radio Install Dash Kit]].  There are other kits by different brands for most vehicles. One of those will allow you to install (or have professionally installed) in older vehicles where this system will add some modern touches.<br /><br />The reasons why I subtracted a star are the touchscreen is not as sensitive as I had hoped (not unusable, but frustrating sometimes), and the instructions are not that great. A professional will have no problem installing this unit, and there is a comprehensive wiring diagram in the product photos on this page. If you are planning to do the install yourself, refer to that photo to get an idea of the complexity of the job.<br /><br />For me, the bluetooth capability and radio make this is great bargain in my opinion. I have a back-up camera that attaches to a license plate holder that adds that feature (you will need to provide your own camera, but they are inexpensive.) While this will display videos, you will need to load them via the TF card slot because this has no DVD (or CD) slot for that kind of media. Frankly, streaming music via bluetooth obviates the need for a CD (in my opinion), and I do not foresee myself ever needing to use any video player in the driver/front passenger compartment of a vehicle. If those are important to you, this is not the in-dash solution for you.<br /><br />My overall impression is this is a good - and very inexpensive - solution for upgrading in-dash entertainment and hands free solutions in older vehicles. Before you plunk down your money, though, make sure that this will fit your vehicle, and that there is an adapter kit available for installing it in your vehicle's make, model and year.",

Even when it is hot, a little bit of a draft can make it seem cooler. Large desk fans and box fans can create too much air flow, but a small desk fan like a USB fan is often just the ticket for getting the air flow without blowing papers everywhere. I have worked with other BTOOP products and they have all been very good, so I had high expectations for this fan. The only real issue I have had with this fan is that my son has absconded with it and claimed it for himself.<br /><br />The most obvious advantage of this fan is that it does not require batteries or direct AC power. It plugs into a USB port on a computer, power bank or even a charging block and that is all it needs to run for hours.<br /><br />What has struck me as most interesting about this fan is that it is all metal, not cheap plastic anywhere. Even the blades of the fan are metal. It’s a refreshing change from all of the plastic junk that is prevalent everywhere. I have a huge air mover in my bedroom and even that fan is mostly plastic.<br /><br />Considering that this is a metal fan and not a plastic one, the current asking price (under $15, subject to change) is surprising. I would have expected it to cost a lot more.<br /><br />This fan operates quietly but still is able to move substantial air, enough to cool down a work space.<br /><br />There are a couple of small improvements in design that would make this fan even better, in my opinion. It is not the easiest to adjust the tilt and having a wing nut to loosen/tighten the screws for tilt would be a big help to that end. That is an easy modification that can be made at home without really any effort. The other improvement would be a variable fan speed setting but this is not a deal-breaker. The price of the fan is compensation enough for these two minor quibbles.<br /><br />Overall, this is a nice little fan and I like it. I especially appreciate the fact that is it all metal and it works so quietly.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

My old 500w PSU is still working fine.<br /><br />I was running some overclocking on a Vega 56 and Ryzen 5 2600 on a different 500w CPU and everything was fine.  I decided to get this PSU as an \"upgrade\" for more headroom and a bit of future-proofing.  Not only can this PSU not handle even the minimal overclocking I was doing on my Vega and Ryzen, and not only can it not handle just one of the two, for some reason it causes my computer to shut down with absolutely no overclocking.  This seems to be a very bad PSU and I will be returning it.  I took a gamble on this brand and I wish I wouldn't have.",

            "question": "title: Another non-standard use\ntext: I decided to take a chance and use this a bit differently than designed.<br /><br />I have a Foscam WiFi security camera in a steel pole barn. Even with a high gain antenna on the camera and a fiberglass door, my connection was pretty bad. Choppy video and lost connections were common. I needed to get the antenna outside.<br /><br />Although this antenna isn't outdoor rated, it is pretty easy to make watertight. Some tape over the mounting screw holes on the back and a little self vulcanizing rubber electrical tape around the antenna joint and no water is going to get in. You could use something like RTV silicone too. Keep the moisture out and you now made it outdoor capable. It was pretty close the way it comes and I'm sure it would probably be fine for a long time, but sealing it completely is pretty easy. The magnet mount works great on the steel siding. The camera I have, like most, comes with a standard SMA connector vs.the SMA-RP (reversed pin), but you can get an adapter here on Amazon. [[ASIN:B005H488Y4 SMA Male to SMA-RP Female Adapter]]<br /><br />Added a 20 foot cable with standard SMA male and female connectors and now I have a great outdoor antenna for an indoor camera in a steel building that is great for blocking radio signals. It works very well and the results exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />I've bought another antenna for the same setup on another camera. Although it isn't exactly what they intended it for, it works extremely well.",

But since this MBP will be used between two people this time, we decided to get some sort of protection for it besides the padded sleeve. This one was far more expensive than others, but I love the colors and that I could see a majority of MBP. It snaps-fit into the MBP. They're a bit stiff and the snap sounds like it damages the computer, but obviously it's supposed to protect it I guess that's normal.<br /><br />The kit comes with two filters that fit over the MBP as well, in case you're worried about having full coverage. Though I&#34;m not sure if there are any films to remove from them; they come with tabs that you have to remove--like from phone screen protectors--but they remove nothing when I remove them. I lifted them up and out and just the tabs took off. Weird.<br /><br />It's very pricey for what it is, but it looks sleek and doesn't add much bulk. I like the blue accents in the inside, though they're barely noticeable when on the computer.<br />The bump at the bottom where you rest your thumb when using the track pad takes some getting used to. I've been used to the groove of the MBP for years, which has been improved with each subsequent model, but this one tries to make it easier to find the notch but at the same time throws me off because I'm not used to it.<br /><br />It's a nice case; maybe a bit pricey, but I love the colors.

I love the build quality of this material, it's a solid feeling metallic body instead of cheap plastic, and it gives the impression of a product that will hold up to the test of time.<br />The price is also impressive for a name brand product with this kind of build quality. However, I had almost forgotten how slow USB2.0 can be. I'm so used to USB3 storage speeds of easily over 150MB/s, that the benchmarks on this one seem almost painfully slow at around the 20MB/s mark. But, that's par for the course with the older standard, so I can't really fault the product for it. This is a great value but you could easily get a much faster storage stick for a bit more money. I could see this being useful for someone who wants to distribute a hard-copy of something by hand and would like to order a bulk supply of durable and fast-enough but still affordable media. Otherwise, I think I'd recommend one that is USB 3 compatible at least since you can always be backwards compatible with 2.0 if necessary, but have the increased speed when available.",

As a chubby woman, it brought back flashbacks of trying to put on pantyhose too soon after a shower, or on a humid summer day...good luck! 😄<br /><br />But, I persisted and slowly got it on correctly. It has a textured back to help keep your grip. It does kind of cause the volume button to feel recessed a bit, but that is not a deal breaker. It also includes a wrist strap, but there is no designated punchout for it, so it seems useless to me. The strap is also too small to go over your wrist, so just a pointless addition.<br /><br />I love the colors though, and it will definitely help me find it on the floor, or amid blankets. The silicone might even help stop my cat from ceremoniously shoving it off his spot by my pillow, but we'll see about thay one.<br /><br />Overall, I'm pretty happy with these.

There was something wrong with the configuration, and the tech support people could not get the computer to perform properly.  After many hours online with tech support, the situation started to seem hopeless.  The pandemic began to become worrisome both here and in India (tech support), and I returned the desktop for a fully refund.<br /><br />Last week I started again trying to find a desktop with Windows 10.  I didn't want to spend a small fortune for a computer that I use primarily for shopping, email, browsing, and, rarely, online banking transactions.  I found this Acer after reading good reviews.  Since my current desktop is an I3 and has basically the same specs, I chose this computer rather than the I5.<br /><br />One of my siblings told me that Acer has a long history of excellent quality and that I would be pleased.  He was right! This desktop is great.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Comes with Windows 10 pre-installed.  Plug it in. It's ready to go.<br />Norton Security is pre-loaded with a 30-day trial period.<br />The computer is extremely user friendly.  I had no struggles with glitches with any of the programs.<br />Bloatware is easy to recognize and easy to remove (a Windows 10 feature).<br /><br />CONS:<br />There really are no cons except that the \"feel\" of the plastic components is not as hefty as some of the desktops that I have used in the past (other companies).  The plastic casing of the tower, the keyboard, and the mouse are beautifully designed but not quite as heavy as prior desktops that I have owned.  That isn't necessarily a \"con,\" and I like the keyboard, mouse, and computer case.  Very attractively designed.<br /><br />MY RATING:<br />5 STARS<br /><br />The price, the ease of use, the beautiful performance -- a great buy!",

            "question": "title: Decent for TV, not great for PC\ntext: I was looking for a simple keyboard/mouse combo to use with a Windows 10 htpc attached to a projector. Pairing was simple enough- unfortunately, I needed to dig up a real USB mouse in order to pair, but that's true of all Bluetooth input devices. Unlike a unit that uses a USB dongle, you need some other form of input to initiate the process first. On my fire stick, I was able to pair it using the remote pretty easily as well. Once paired, you are able to use it like a directly connected keyboard or mouse by just powering it on in the future.<br />The lights are cool looking (and very nice when using in the dark with a home theater setup), and the keyboard is nice and large, easy to type on. However, the mouse was little bit too jumpy for my taste. It was difficult to nail icons with accuracy due to how erratically it moved. On Windows, I'm sure I could have turned down the mouse speed to make it better, but on my fire stick there isn't that kind of control available. I definitely would not use this as a keyboard/mouse replacement for a desktop experience due to the mouse experience, however it is ok for a presentation control or htpc that doesn't require a lot of pointing or clicking.<br />The only thing is that I KNOW there are smaller keyboard-only devices on the market if you aren't going to need the mouse that much, and ones that can use a USB dongle to avoid the pairing process. And if you want to use this with something like a firestick or Roku, one could argue the mouse part (which takes up a significant amount of real estate on the bar) is superfluous and doesn't have such precision control even if you DO want it (using Silk browser, for example). I sort of feel like you can get better options in all those scenarios, but it is OK at what it does. So 4 stars at best.",

You don't need external power for this hub, unless you want it; in which case you need to provide your own power source (there is a USB-C port on the side that you can plug the power source into). If you are going to be using this hub for everyday devices (flash drives, mouse/keyboard, etc.), you don't need external power anyway.<br /><br />Having 7 (!) expansion USB 3.2 ports sitting on your desk is a game changer. Much easier than plugging directly into your computer. The high transfer speed is SO nice. Most (newer) PCs only have 1 or 2 USB 3.2 ports, so getting 7 with this hub is awesome.<br /><br />It seems like a selling point for this hub is the 32 degree angle that it sits at, which at first I didn't think would be a big deal at first, but it is definitely better than a lay-flat hub (i.e., every other hub I've had). Makes it quite easy to plug in/out of.<br /><br />The only thing I'd wish for is faster charging (even with external power plugged in, it's not very fast).<br /><br />Bottom line: a great hub.",

In truth, the Type-C port is a huge mess.  There are so many functions that the port is designed for that a normal consumer would have a hard time understanding all of them.  In my case, the type-c port on my computer doesn't support HDMI video output.  This port came in handy with its Displaylink technology.<br /><br />As a dock, the iVANKY 15 in 1 Triple Display dock is a great product that, if your laptop has USB charging capabilities, can connect all of your external devices with just one USB plug.  You can connect multiple external monitors, external USB drive, your keyboard/mouse, and gain the ability to read SD and MicroSD cards, all with a single plug.  In terms of charging, the PD port outputs 18W of power which is good enough for fast charging your tablet and phone, and the computer port outputs 94w, powerful enough for many laptops running a CPU up to an Intel i5.  All this is packaged in a modern, metal shell and it even has a 100w power adapter included.<br /><br />Already, this is a great dock, but the DisplayLink feature sets this dock apart from the rest of the pack.  DisplayLink allows a computer to output video to a computer monitor (up to 4K) through a standard USB 3.1 port.  This means that if you have a type-c that doesn't support video output or if it only has Type-A ports, this dock can still give you the ability to add more monitors to your setup.  Just install the included drivers (the dock shows up as a computer drive when you plug it in) and this dock will extend your desktop.<br /><br />While it is a little pricey, this dock has the quality and functionality to justify it.",

The following are my observations that, with  Debbie Lee Wesselmann's excellent review, should give you a complete picture of this hub.<br /><br />First, word about using this hub for charging devices.  The specs on this product page at the time of this review claim that this hub will NOT charge devices. Actually, it charged my two phones and another device while I was doing other tasks. Perhaps the specs mean it is not intended to be a standalone charger. The only thing that I do NOT like is the wall wart type power supply that is approximately 3x2x2 inches. It can (and does) block adjacent plugs in my surge protector. However, I can live that that considering the functionality I get from this hub.<br /><br />My favorite feature and the reason I awarded this hub five stars is the integrated electrical safeguards that protect against over voltage, over current, leakage and short circuits. This may not be a big deal for cheap peripherals like mice, but for an expensive hard drive or my Galaxy Note 3 it's a welcome feature.<br /><br />If you have a computer and peripherals that are USB 3.0 compliant this hub will boost your transfer speeds significantly. For example, my new Samsung Note 3 will transfer at the 5gbps speed, but frankly I do most of my data transfers over WiFi. However, if you wanted to attach an external 3.0 hard drive to your laptop this hum will allow it to operate to it's full potential - which is lightning fast.<br /><br />Set-up is easy. You literally connect the included power supply, plug it into your system's USB port and switch it on. All of platforms with which I tested it immediately recognized the hub and the things I plugged into it (which included a flash drive, mouse, two snart phones (Galaxy Note II and Note 3), and a speaker that is powered by USB.<br /><br />This hub works with Windows 98 (I have an old Sony running it and this hub plugged in and worked with it), and above. I know it works with Win XP, Vista and 7 because I also tested the hub on those platforms. I do not have access to a Windows 8 system so am taking the manufacturer's word that it works on that too. If your experience is different please leave a comment.<br /><br />One final feature that makes this a five star hub in my opinion is the fact that this will simultaneously support maximum data transfer of up to four high speed devices (three of which can be USB 3.0) plugged into it. Of course the host system needs to be USB 3.0 too, but the hub will sling data as fast as the host can accept it. Not all hubs will operate in this mode, and I suspect that the external power supply has something to do with that level of performance.",

            "question": "title: Mostly excellent, but does disconnect once in a while.\ntext: Having recently dug my music collection (odd how we go back into hobbies after years of stagnation), I took time to curate my setup (and by setup I mean my Note8 with a USB DAC) for optimal listening. Until recently, but \"best\" headphones were my Shure Aonic 4, which are excellent for the price range. The cable it comes with is okay, but preferably replaceable. It comes with an inline mic and makes a lot of feedback-noise when moved. I know cables are a mixed bag when it comes to audio equipment, so I shied away for years. But rather than place the emphasis on audio-quality improvement when looking at cables, I realized I'd rather get a cable if it looks and feels good. This one fit the ticket.<br /><br />This is the only cable I have that's meant to be swapped with MMCX in-ear headphones. They pair well with the Aonic 4. First, I'll get the problems I have out of the way.<br /><br />Since this cable is meant to connect with around-the-ear IEMs, there's a plastic wrap near each MMCX adapter. It makes wearing around the ears easier, but putting them on initially takes a few tries. They are easy to tangle, even if I use the \"roadie wrap.\" Putting them on while on the go proved to be suboptimal; I have to be sitting or standing to put them on.<br /><br />Sometimes I get some feedback noise, but rarely. Definitely not the same as the stock cable that comes with the Aonic 4.<br /><br />The biggest problem I have is that the end connection disconnects nearly every time I use the cable. Having a modular cable is awesome, but the connection from the cable to the audio jack doesn't lock. I expected there to be a click, indicating it's on and snug, but no such thing. Since I use this cable while on the go, it's connected to my phone, which rests in my pocket. At least once the cable end will come loose. It's easy to press back in (just a little nudge will do), but it is rather annoying.<br /><br />Now for the good.<br /><br />The cable feels awesome. I get now why people prefer to upgrade certain cables. I care very little for how much the audio quality is \"improved\" (there's too much immeasurable subjectivity in that area), but having a cable that doesn't tangle easily and is very light makes enough of a difference to justify the upgrade. The cable is soft to the touch, though I don't doubt its ruggedness in the long term. The MMCX connectors snap satisfactorily into the Shure IEMs; at least those haven't come loose. The metal ends and Y-splitter are very nice and definitely attribute the cable with a premium look.<br /><br />This cable has sold me on the reasons to upgrade headphone cables.",

Can't figure out how to boot though\ntext: I have an older HP workstation that predates M.2 SSD drives, and I REALLY wanted to add some high speed goodness to it for improving boot times. This adapter was super simple! Just assemble it using the screws and bracket (which are self explanatory if you've ever installed a card before), and then CAREFULLY mount the SSD to it. This actually took me a bit to figure out, I'm used to having a screw that holds down the SSD, this is more like a holding mount that it fits into which screws in on the back. But once I got it figured out, it installed fine and allowed me to initialize and format my SSD in Windows 10.<br />Speed was good, about what it should be on a MB mounted nvme, but the only issue I'm having is figuring out how to boot Windows from it. It doesn't show up as a recognized boot device in my Bios, which isn't really the fault of the device and more an issue with my computer in particular.

            "question": "title: Enterprise/LTE/4G version works with Verizon\ntext: Do not buy this if you're looking for the fastest tablet. That's not what it is, though it's by no means slow. It will take a lot more abuse than the fastest tablets available for the same price. You can stand outside in the rain or snow and use the touchscreen when it's wet. You can drop it in the mud, pick it up, wipe it off, and keep using it. I wouldn't take it scuba diving though. I will take it off-roading. This one has enough storage to preload maps for off-road hiking/biking/riding/driving for when there's no signal at all.<br /><br />I've seen several questions about whether this works with Verizon, and several people answer that it doesn't. Those people are wrong. The Enterprise/LTE/4G/WiFi version does work with Verizon. It should work with others. Find this model number (SM-T577UZKGN14) on the Samsung site to check. Samsung knows. Those other people don't.<br /><br />This is the third tablet I've used my Verizon SIM card in. The first was a tablet I bought through Verizon. The second was a TabActive2, and now I'm using the same SIM card in this TabActive3. This does not apply to the WiFi-only version. Don't confuse the two.<br /><br />I pulled the SIM card out of the TabActive2, inserted it in the TabActive3, restarted the device as requested, and a few minutes later the line was active on the new device. I ignored Verizon's emailed instructions, because they don't appear to apply to swapping a current SIM card into a new device. I even restored a Google backup from the 2 to the 3 and saved a lot of time installing apps.<br /><br />So, why this tablet? It's rugged. It's Samsung. I really like having an 8\" tablet. It works with Verizon.<br /><br />Why 4G/LTE? It's not 5G. I drive a truck through at least 5 states on a regular basis, and in some areas the signal constantly switches between 4G and 5G and the data connection is interrupted. When I can't access online banking, credit cards, and apps relating to business with my 5G phone, I often can with a 4G tablet. I have unlimited data on a second plan for only $10/mth, since I already have a smartphone plan. No hotspot/WiFi needed.<br /><br />Why upgrade? My TabActive2 only had 16GB of internal storage. The TabActive3 I bought has 128GB. The TabActive3 has DEX. The TabActive2 didn't. I didn't manage to hurt the 2, and the 3 is physically very similar. The 3 has a faster CPU, and a faster GPU.<br /><br />From the beginning, everything about the TabActive2 as a usable tablet simply wasn't enough. It wasn't fast enough. It didn't have enough storage. But it was rugged. It still is. This is the first time I've upgraded when the old tablet still worked as well as it did when I bought it. It appears that the TabActive3 is just as rugged.<br /><br />Con: The biggest downside to these is that there's no external charger that I can find for the replaceable battery. At least I can't find one. Maybe one exists. I have no evidence of that. It is possible to buy another compatible battery, but I can't find any way to charge said battery other than to charge it in the tablet, and it's a pain to get to, because of the lengths Samsung went to to seal the battery compartment. The battery life is substantial, partly due to the less-than-premium performance, but it would really be nice to be able to easily carry a fully-charged spare.",

            "question": "title: Nice but very fragile\ntext: I got one of these for the holidays last year (12/06) and I was totally stoked. This was my first iPod--what a shame that it turned out to be such a fragile, poorly engineered device. I mean, this thing got dropped once from about 2.5 feet (it was only 2 months old) and it was TOAST (and it was in a plastic hardshell case!). I have had Laptops that survived worse. Come to think of it, I've had a lot of (far cheaper) devices that are better able to take abuse than this $400 item--including TV remotes, cell phones, Nintendo Game Boys (designed to be nearly indestructible), OTHER MP3 PLAYERS, etc. It seems that a physically appealing design does not necessarily equate to superior engineering--quite the opposite in this case. I do like it, and the replacement I got from Apple works very well. It's great looking and it does the job well. Too bad I'm so terrified of dropping it that I had to buy a big, bulky silicone case to improve its chances of survival. Let me tell ya, in its crash-test-dummy outfit, it no longer looks even the slightest bit sleek.<br /><br />Have you ever dropped your keys when getting out of the car? Your cell phone? If you answered yes to either of the above, then you can probably expect to drop your iPod one day. I hope you have a (thickly) carpeted garage--or that it lands on your foot. Bottom line: If I were thinking of getting an MP3 player, iPod or another brand, it would have zero moving parts; on other words, I would buy a flash-based device instead of one with a hard drive.<br /><br />I also cannot help but wonder why Nintendo does not take what they have learned about building child-proof, nearly indestructible portable gaming devices and apply this to a worthy competitor to the iPod. I would be the first in line...<br /><br />I gave this product 3 stars because it does a good job of what it is touted to do: play MP3s & video/images. In fact, the user interface, including the GUI and the click wheel is one of the nicest, most intuitive designs I have ever seen on a piece of consumer electronics equipment. Too bad it's put together so cheaply. Grossly overpriced? Most definitely. I hope the iPhone turns out to be a higher quality piece.<br /><br />---<br /><br />UPDATE: 8/2013: still working fine... :)",

Speakers are horrible and bad viewing angles.\ntext: Very easy to use this- I set it up in like a minute without even reading the instructions thanks to the on screen prompts. It was very painless.<br /><br />Picture quality is so so- it's decent looking but basically, you have to be standing somewhere in front of it to see full color- the image and color is distorted if you look at it from the side or any other angle. But other than that- it does look pretty good and the picture is very usable and nice looking.<br /><br />Sound- it calls the speakers \"loud speakers\" but some videos I can BARELY hear sound, others I can hear it if everything around me is quiet and that's with the frame's volume turned up to max! Nothing \"loud\" about this and sadly it doesn't have bluetooth or amy sound output. I guess if you want sound, your best bet is the play music with some other device along with this.<br /><br />Overall this is a fairly nice, easy-to-use frame. I loaded pictures and videos on it with ease. The speakers need major improvement. The only other complaint is the price point but these frames all seem to be higher priced than a tv which seems silly. You can get a 24 inch tv with a usb slot cheaper than this 15\" screen and it'd probably have better picture. For the price, It should have much better viewing angles/ better video quality.",

This kit arrived in great condition and was very well packaged. Each piece had it's own box, so this was great protection for the shipping process. This includes everything I need to use with my own camera to make my own quality portraits. I work nights and often struggled with lighting to take photos at home. I really like to pose dolls from my collection to make photo stories to share with other hobbyists. This can sometimes be a long process that takes several sessions to complete. This kit does not take up too much room for me to use it over the course of several days to complete a project. It does not take much time to setup after the initial opening. Between uses, it is easy to store in it's own nylon case underneath my bed. The only minor problem I had was one bulb did not work out of the box. I found this to be a very easy issue to remedy as bulbs are the only part of this kit that will need replaced with use. I especially appreciate the thoughtfulness of all the inclusions of this set. The backdrops are light-weight and easy to store. When I set up a backdrop after storage, I find that a little bit of wrinkle spray works right away! I do use the green screen often too, and that is included as well as 2 others. This is a great set for me and my uses.<br /><br />This is an ideal set for anyone that wishes to shoot photos as a hobby. It is sturdy enough to stay setup for days on end, but not so sturdy that it could take much abuse. I would not recommend this for professional portraits of children that may be prone to knocking over equipment, as the components of this set is not designed for abuse. I find that for all of the inclusions, and the ease of storage, this set makes a really great value.

I’m not a gamer or a professional photographer, but I still can appreciate having crystal-clear resolution and stunning color for everything on my desktop.  The extra width (27” diagonal) means the desktop itself is huge, even when the display is set to show text, apps, and other items at 200%, as I prefer.  (If I use the included Split Screen 2.0 app, which makes full use of the 3840 x 2160 native resolution--using tiny icons and text, and offering multiple options for 2 or more split screens--there is an incredible amount of desktop workspace available.)<br /><br />The one snag that I ran into, is that the on-board graphics in my 3-year-old ASUS computer (running Windows 10) were NOT capable of displaying the 3840 x 2160  native resolution.  This meant that the monitor would not display my Windows desktop until I purchased and installed a new graphics card.  My card is a NVIDIA GeForce GT 710 (in stock at Best Buy in the gaming section).<br /><br />Any of the following graphics cards will work, with either a DisplayPort or HDMI connection.  For Windows OS:  (1) the Intel HD4600 or higher; (2) the AMD HD7000 or higher,  the AMD R7 or Higher, or the AMD FireProW600 or higher; or  (3) the NVIDIA GeForce GT 640 or higher, the NVIDIA Quadro K500 or higher, the NVIDIA GeForce GTX960 or higher.  For Mac OS:  MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, early 2015); MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, mid 2014); Mac Pro (late 2013); iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, late 2014 and after); MacBook Air (early 2015).<br /><br />The monitor worked with the drivers that came with the NVIDIA card, but had a barely visible flicker.  Installing the drivers that came with the LG monitor itself corrected the flicker and resulted in the beautiful display that I love.<br /><br />The monitor's simple, elegant design is also worthy of comment.  The stand is rock-solid, and the curved base not only looks great but takes up little space on a table or whatever you have it resting on.  The flat display screen is adjustable to many, many angles.

            "question": "title: Much Better than TomTom's EasyPort Mount\ntext: I have a TomTom Start and I have disliked the EasyPort mount from the day I got it. I had been telling my wife for months that I was going to get a “proper” mount for my TomTom and that day finally came when I accidentally broke the EasyPort mount. After a little research I decided on this particular mount, and so far I have been very pleased with it.<br /><br />I wanted a more “normal” windshield mount - a suction cup with a lever instead of a twist ring, and that led me to this particular mount. The design is simple - press the suction cup against the windshield and flip the lever to make the cup stick to the window. In operation this is an easy-to-use mount and it seems to hold the navigator in place without too much trouble. As expected it does not hold well when it the windshield is cold, which is an issue with every suction-based mount I have ever used - including the EasyPort.<br /><br />The ring in which the TomTom attaches to the mount holds the TomTom in place well enough but I have observed that it does not hold the navigator tightly. That is, the TomTom has a tendency to turn a little in the ring. So far this has not been an issue and the TomTom has not fallen out of the ring so this really does not bother me.<br /><br />The mount is adjustable and provides for a couple of places where the position can be tweaked for maximum visibility. There should be no issue with getting the position of the GPS just right so it can be seen but not in the way.<br /><br />So far I am pleased with this mount and am happy to recommend it. It’s a lot easier to use than the EasyPort mount that comes with the TomTom and it’s adjustable enough to make visibility a non-issue, even while in motion. If you have a TomTom and you don’t like the EasyPort mount, this mounting system is a big improvement.",

While I was pretty sure the bags would be that crunchy plastic you see on Easter baskets or grocery store flowers. I hoped it would be a bit closer to something softer or maybe silicone like. The heat shrink works great and fits all my remotes well. The downside is you end up with corners of hard plastic with sharp/pointy edges after the shrink (tried multiple methods or sealing and still rough corners). And getting the air out is near impossible. You end up with a balloon around your remote and some of the buttons can't be pressed (a plus if you are just storing things). Or you put a pin hole in the plastic and the seal is tight, but maybe too tight after you get the full heat shrink smooth. One remote of mine has a frequently used button 2 in from the side and it is hard to use now.<br />You get a lot of bags and it might be trial and error to find the balance if you plan to use the item you shrink wrapped. Its a good product and serves the purpose I wanted it for. Just wish they could come up with a softer less crunchy plastic.<br />Hair dryer is all you need to shrink the plastic.

This interface is in the form of sounds the relate to each of the functions - power on/off, paring, etc.  These headphones have a TERRIBLE interface.  When you power them on an annoyingly loud series of tones blares in your ear.  The tones rise in pitch.  When you continue to hold the power button, to access the paring mode, all you hear is an extremely brief, muffled tone.  Apparently, the makers thought this was enough of a signal to indicate you're in paring mode.  Believe me, it is NOT obvious at all.  When you power off the headphones, you hear the same annoying loud series of tones.  In this case, the tones do not decrease in pitch, which one might expect.<br /><br />By comparison, the audio interface of my other Bluetooth headphones are a joy - unfortunately, they do not have volume controls or skip and rewind.  When powering them on, a pleasant female voice says, \"Hello\", and when you enter pairing mode, the same voice says, \"Ready to pair.\"  When pairing is established, the voice says, You're connected\", then tells me how much charge I have - either full, medium or low.  These Cootree headphones do none of that.  You'll be lucky if you're able to tell if they've been turned off properly.<br /><br />In terms of sound quality, they're okay - nothing exceptional.  In terms of fit, they're okay as well.  Again, nothing exceptional.

It can also work as a doorbell, too.<br /><br />Installation was simple and easy. It works fine. The only thing is that it does require batteries so you will have to change those to keep up with it.

            "question": "title: Spacious and Well-Designed Backpack Camera Bag\ntext: I have a growing interest in photography and I have been learning as I go. One of the things I have discovered is that a good camera bag – sufficiently large to hold the camera, lenses you need and any accessories – is absolutely essential. I have a messenger-style camera bag that works well enough but I have run out of room in it and it does not have the capacity to hold all of my extra lenses and filters. I looked to this camera bag as a solution. It definitely holds more than my old bag, it seems to be made well and there are some nice features to this bag.<br /><br />This is a backpack style bag and it is about the same size as a small travel backpack, though it is an order of magnitude thicker. There are zippers and pockets everywhere. There's a lot of padding to protect the camera and multiple movable partitions.<br /><br />The main compartment is large enough to hold a small laptop if all of the partitions are pulled out. There are three small partitions and two large ones and these can be arranged in any configuration to accommodate a wide array of accessories. As shipped, the partitions are arranged to allow for the camera lens and camera to sit through the middle of the pack which maximizes the padding and protection for the most valuable parts of your setup, and the smaller partitions are about right for 2-3 lens kits. I have a smaller camera – a Samsung NX300 with the 18-55mm lens – so I need less room for my camera and rearranged the configuration to permit room for several filter kits, a telephoto lens, a fisheye lens and a few smaller accessories, all in the main compartment. I have not yet purchased additional lenses but will rearrange when I do.<br /><br />The main compartment also has a pocket that is suitable for either a thin book or a tablet. So, even with all of my other gear in the main compartment, I still have room for my tablet. I really can't ask for much more than that.<br /><br />There is a smaller zippered compartment on the front that has room for even more accessories. In this I have loaded up a spare set of macro lenses that would not fit in the main compartment. Inside this compartment there is yet another pocket suitable for holding a tablet as well as a mesh pocket for loose items, my choice being a couple of pens. However, the most interesting item in there, attached by a tether, is a waterproof nylon cover for the whole bag. So, if you need to go out in the rain with this backpack, you can do so without fear of getting your equipment wet.<br /><br />On the sides there are two small pockets, sufficient for holding a couple of small items like a filter or two or even a very small flashlight.<br /><br />On the front there is one more zippered pocket that is well suited for thin items, like a map, magazine or papers.<br /><br />The shoulder straps are adjustable and padded so getting the pack to fit just right is not an issue. However, there is a carrying handle loop on the top of this bag and I prefer carrying this bag using that instead (I have always preferred carrying backpacks this way).<br /><br />This is a very nice camera bag. A lot of thought went into the design and it can hold a lot of equipment for its size. It has replaced my other camera bag outright.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.",

Be careful when you tear off the pictures because if not enough paper is extending out of the slot, the printing can jam. It's very easy to fix however.<br /><br />The camera also includes a micro USB card which records all of your images. Be sure to charge the camera when you pull it out of the box because it doesn't come with enough energy to print right away.

            "question": "title: Smooth\ntext: This is the first Logitech keyboard I've gotten, and now I see why Logitech is considered to be a proficient manufacturer in keyboards and other computer-related paraphernalia.<br /><br />Without installing any such programs or software, either from the website or from the included disc, I plugged in the USB receiver right out of the box, followed the easy-to-setup instructions engraved on the back of the keyboard, and away I went.  I was able to type flawlessly at the office, and the keys are very smooth and quiet.  Even though it's just a keyboard, I kept opening up different programs to test out the typing.  Pure joy!  (For a nerd like me, at least.)<br /><br />I guess the only gripes I have, and I noticed it almost immediately, is that there are no lights to indicate locks for the numbers, caps, or scroll.  It's a minor gripe, but a gripe nonetheless since I have to utilize the Caps Lock every so often at work.<br /><br />When I used the extra buttons for various computer software, I found that the respected programs opened up right away.  There was some stall, but that was the result of my slow, crunching computer.<br />The mouse worked just as it should.<br /><br />Now, I have to admit, what I really wanted to get this keyboard for was my Wii at home.  I know, it sounds nerdy.<br />But the keyboard I was using before was an old office wired one that was given to me.  That one worked fine, but I wanted a wireless one.  So, I took home this MK300 keyboard and USB receiver, plugged in the latter into the back of my Wii console, opened up the Internet Channel and found, to my delight, that the keyboard worked flawlessly.<br />There was some range betwixt the keyboard and receiver--about ten feet or so--but it made no matter: my sitting spot isn't too far from the console, so it's not like I'm going to be typing in a completely different room.<br /><br />Since this keyboard works so well, I was hoping to use it on a Mac.  I've yet to buy the MacBook Pro--which is why I'm stuck with the Wii's Internet Channel for now--and since the specifications for this certain keyboard doesn't include Apple's OS, I'm assuming that there is simply no way around hardware setups (ever tried?) and will have to resort to something else, when the time comes.<br /><br />All in all, though, if you're looking for an excellent wireless (not Bluetooth) keyboard at a relatively inexpensive price tag for any PC machine or Wii, look no further.  The MK300 works like a charm.",

Slim feet that slide into place with no tools- only have ONE configuration. 2 USBs, 4 HDMIs, Ethernet, optical & headphone outputs, & a mini a/v input. Operating system is Google Tv which works smoothly and has lots of apps built in. Works with Google Home and Alexa.<br /><br />Has some intrusive ads on the homepage. You can go into the settings/privacy/ ads to opt out of personalized ads though. You can use your remote microphone to do voice commands on the tv. It also has the nice shortcut buttons for Youtube, Netflix, Disney+, and Prime Video.<br /><br />Sound has tweeters on the side. It upscales the audio to give you a surround sound effect. Acoustic auto calibration which when you go to your sitting area with the remote and start this- it sends these crazy alien laser blaster sounds out of the speakers for a couple seconds and your remote reads them so the tv can process the information and adjust your speakers accordingly. It will then adjust the speakers so it sends sound to where you're sitting to give you the best experience possible!<br /><br />The cognitive processor in this puts more emphasis into the areas of the picture that you'll be focused on- definitely makes a noticeable difference!<br /><br />XR TRILUMINOS PRO technology gives you better color accuracy and depth.<br /><br />XR Contrast booster gives you better contrast.<br /><br />Very deep blacks with very little light blooming (meaning it has very even brightness across the screen.) The screen has PLENTY of brightness, that is definitely not an issue with this tv!<br /><br />Ambient optimization option which changes your screen based on the ambient lighting in the room. Controls brightness and color tones. There are settings to optimize the screen for Netflix, Imax, Cinema, Etc that are amazing!<br /><br />Motion is great, it has 120 hertz which keeps up with the action very well! You can adjust the Motionflow settings to your custom settings or just set it to auto and let it do it's thing.<br /><br />Comparing it to the other top Sony models:<br />If you're on a budget and this is on the higher end of that, you might look into the Sony X80J- it's also a 2021 model and is 4k Ultra HD. It's not quite as nice of a picture as this Full Array but it's still a great tv! Otherwise if you can swing it- this X90J Full Array is definitely a fantastic choice! If your budget can STILL swing more though, you might even look into the X90J OLED tv, it's picture pops even more than this Full Array. Whatever your choice, you'll love any of them! I have all 3 models and we absolutely love each and every one of them- the X80 and X90 line are just fantastic tvs at a really fair price point.",

Does change the typing height of your laptop\ntext: I received this as a free review sample and it was sorely needed because the internal fan in my ThinkPad T61 finally died. Note: if you are looking at this as a cure know that many laptops report a fan failure then shut down. In the case of mine, I found that I could press the On/Off button briefly when that happened and it would power back up and boot Windows.<br /><br />This fan array moves a lot of air, promoting excellent heat transfer. So far it has worked well and I have had no premature shutdowns (although I still have to go through the On/Off button sequence every time I power the ThinkPad up.)<br /><br />Do be aware that this fan array will interfere with other USB peripherals if you power it directly from your laptop, and especially if you add even more peripherals to the ports integrated into this unit. That is because the power draw form USB ports may exceed the capacity of the laptop, especially if you are running it off an unpowered USB hub. I had that problem when I tried running this, a mouse and a speaker from my laptop. I moved this one to a powered hub and the problem was immediately resolved.<br /><br />Also, this raises a laptop 1 3/8 inches higher at its lowest setting. For me it took a day to become accustomed to the raised typing height, but since it solved a genuine problem the tradeoff was worth it. Just know that you will need to adjust to that and it may slow down your productivity for a day or two.<br /><br />If your laptop has a fully functioning internal fan this array will augment that and keep your laptop cool even in unairconditioned spaces on a hot day. That will definitely prolong the life of the internal electronics and the hard drive.",

            "question": "title: Great case! (But read below about problems with features!)\ntext: ***The first part of this review is for the Red option***<br /><br />I needed more than just a simple case for my Kindle as it pulls double duty serving as my tablet and my planner. I also needed something that would provide it with supreme protection as it accompanies me to and from work every day.<br /><br />I purchased this case/portfolio in the red color in hopes that it would make it stand out at work. Many of my co-workers have Kindles as well and I didn't want mine to accidentally get picked up. The red is nice, but way too much for me. I have been considering exchanging it for the black and the following issues are what sent me over the edge and led to my returning the red case.<br /><br />This case/portfolio worked nicely for my needs. However, I removed two stars for two reasons.<br />#1 The case stunk to high heaven. It was so bad that I thought a stink bug had gotten into my house. Though the \"scent\" did lessen over a few weeks, it was still very present after five weeks.<br />#2 The description claims that this case has the ability to put the Kindle to sleep when you close it up. Not true. After my battery died over night, I realized that the sleep/wake feature was not working in my case. I had to physically turn my Kindle off before closing the case (may not seem like much of a hassle, but it quickly becomes a time consuming annoyance).<br /><br />There was one benefit to this case though. It is the first case I have had for my Kindle that does not have any issues with using the Camera App while still encased in the removable inner sleeve. This was a very nice feature, however not nice enough to get me to keep it.<br /><br />**This is the review of the Black option**<br /><br />So, I just returned the red case and opted to give the black version a shot. It arrived this evening and wow, what a difference!<br /><br />It doesn't stink at all and the sleep/wake feature is functioning properly! I do, however, now have the ghastly on-screen message of needing to slide my Kindle up in its case to take a picture. But this does not bother me very much as I have not used my Kindle for taking pictures more than a handful of times in the month that I have owned it.<br /><br />All in all, it is a nice, professional case/portfolio that offers the features for my Kindle that I was needing. It also has a fair amount of pockets inside, though do not expect to be able to store much bulk as you will run into two problems..<br />#1 If you add too many things to the pockets, you run the risk of the pockets bulging and possibly damaging your Kindle's screen.<br />#2 Also, if you add too much to the pockets, you will possibly not be able to close the case. And if you manage to close it, you may run the risk of stretching the zipper and ultimately damaging the case.<br /><br />Personally, I keep a small stack (about 10) of my business cards, five gift certificates and a little cash in the pockets and the zippers still flow smoothly with no issues and nothing from the pocket side comes in contact with my screen. Overall, I would recommend this case, as long as you are willing to take a risk on getting one that has the features you are wanting/needing as it seems to be a completely random toss-up as to which case has which features.<br /><br />On a side note, the included stylus/pen is a great idea, but it isn't executed very well here. The plastic tip leaves a lot to be desired - it takes more force than I care to apply to my screen for the Kindle to register the stylus' contact on the screen. I did some research and purchased [[ASIN:B00E0GV9IC The Friendly Swede Bundle of 6 Micro-Knit Hybrid Fiber Tip Universal Capacitive Stylus Pens 4.5\" for Smart Phone Touch Pad + 6 x 15'' Elastic Tether Lanyards + Cleaning Cloth in Retail Packaging]]. These stylus' are VERY nice in appearance and easy to use without requiring much force on the screen at all.",

I'd originally found the case to be far too shiny and cheap looking, but the shine wears down and it's starting to get a bit more lived in and is actually looking kind of nice now.<br /><br />The light seems fragile, and it probably is more delicate than the KK's light, but it's doing its job well, better than the KK's since the light is more even.<br /><br />I love the front cover, which is super thin and stiff.and the case itself doesn't add that much bulk.  The whole package is the size of a slim mass market paperback.  I can't stand reading the KT caseless.  It's too small and thin and it bugs me.<br /><br />My only complaint is that there's nothing to keep the cover closed.  I get that they were trying to make the case as thin as possible, but the cover will flip open in one's purse.  I just make sure to put it in open side down now, but I'd have preferred some kind of closure.",

I went through all of the Windows10 fixes thinking it was an update issue, then I went to two new DVD drives from two different vendors, two full sets of cables, all to No avail!<br />It turned out to be that the first bank of SATA connectors of the MB were nonoperational.<br />Secondly, I kept getting error messages that the USB device(wireless mouse, keyboard),were drawing more current than the connector could supply. I connected this two other computers and had no issues.  The computer I took it off of had no issues, either.<br />Aorus/Gigabyte  \"tech support\" is vaporware.

Sadly,  the magnets only hold the cover closed.  Despite that shortcoming, I do like this case.  My HDX rarely travels anywhere, so all I need is a simple case with a built-in stand that will protect the tablet from dust and scratches.<br /><br />This MarBlue Ultra Lightweight case is made of thin leatherette.  It has an interior flap pocket that holds the fairly heavy Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" securely.  The case has a faux-suede lining that makes it feel just a tiny bit luxurious.  The case doesn't have any padding to cushion the HDX from accidental drops, or from loose items in a backpack or bag.<br /><br />The back cover of the case has cutouts for the speakers, power button, volume control, light-level sensor, and rear-facing camera.  As you can see from my accompanying video slide show, these cutouts aren't placed with laser precision.  However, all of the control buttons are accessible, and the off-center cutouts don't faze the rear-facing camera or the light-level sensor.<br /><br />The built-in stand is solid in the \"writing desk\" position, and reasonably solid in the upright position.  The big HDX tablet doesn't wobble in the upright position, but it can be easily knocked over because of the steep upright angle.  The worst feature of the stand is the tab support.  To set up the stand, you need to fold back the front cover, pull the tab on the back cover up with your fingernails,  and then fumble a bit to secure the edge of the folded-back front cover beneath the tab.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the price (about $20) makes this Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" case an attractive choice if all you need is a bare-bones tablet cover.  Still, because the case doesn't wake my HDX automatically, I rate it at only 4 stars (\"I like it\" on the official Amazon scale).",

This surge protector will protect up to 1500 joules - what makes it especially impressive is it is safe for outdoor use!<br /><br />I have thoroughly tested this surge protector and it has passed all of my testing.  This will definitely protect your important investments.<br /><br />The only thing I wish was different was the outlets should be spaced a bit further apart to allow for larger power blocks. So many plugs are nonstandard and end up blocking surrounding outlets.  The only thing that would make this product better would be if the outlets rotated which would make them far more adaptable to oddly sized plugs.<br /><br />The 3 USB ports are definitely a nice addition as this helps avoid having to use plugs for USB powered devices.  What is even better about this particular surge protector is the USB-A ports are 3.0 (which charge far faster than previous versions).<br /><br />This is an outstanding surge protector that has proven itself through my extensive use and testing.  While this, nor any power supply should be submerged in water, this can definitely withstand moisture and splashes of water.

            "question": "title: Perfect for casual listening\ntext: I own a number of Brainwavz models, all of which compare favorably to more expensive in ear monitors (IEMs). I am going to compare the review sample of this model to two other Brainwavz IEMs: [[ASIN:B00G4UQ6U8 Brainwavz S1 In Ear Headphones]] and the [[ASIN:B009UNZ5WQ Brainwavz R1 In Ear Noise Isolating Earphones]]. What I will try to avoid is repeating the other reviews - many of which are excellent - and the product specs on this page. Here are my impressions of these phones. Bear in mind that I listen primarily to acoustic jazz, so my listening needs may be vastly different from yours.<br /><br />The first thing I do with I test phones or speakers is to play Miles Davis' [[ASIN:B00136JQMI Kind Of Blue]] to get a feel for how well the various frequencies are reproduced. That album has instruments in the low, mid and high bands, and these phones seemed to have more bass than the R1 or the S1. The mids and highs on those models, though, had more clarity. I tried a few other albums that had heavier bass and these definitely did a better job of reproducing those frequencies. When I switched to some tracks with female vocalists the R1 and S1 were better phones, and both of the other phones were clearer with higher register instruments.<br /><br />From a comfort perspective these phones were a little lighter than the other two IEMs against which I compared them, although I would consider it a tie among them for overall comfort. These phones and the R1 had a value-added bonus in that a [[ASIN:B00HPPL1M4 Brainwavz Hard Earphone Case]] is included.<br /><br />My conclusion is these are nice low-to-mid range IEMs that can compete with much more expensive IEMs from both Brainwavz and competing brands. I am impressed with the quality, completeness of the solution and the way these sound on lower end audio gear like MP3 players, phones and tablets. For higher end audio I would probaby use the S1 model  because to my ears that one sounds better. However, you cannot go wrong with this one for everyday use when you want to listen to your music without disturbing others.",

They have come a long way over the years, with more features and more comfort. One that is great for those who like to add a little color to their navigation is this wireless mouse from PEIOUS.<br /><br />Shaped for your hands, this mouse is comfortable to hold and click. It’s easy enough to use and you can’t feel any strain on your hands, so it earns good marks there. But the feature that is most appealing is the lights. You can change the lights to different modes and even shut them off completely, if you prefer. I like that the lights are soft- you notice them, but they are not so bright that they distract from what you are doing.<br /><br />The bluetooth works okay on this mouse and one of the more unusual features is that you have to plug it in to charge. With most others I have used, you need to supply batteries, but this one charges by plugging it into a usb outlet. It’s nice not to have to buy batteries, but it also means you need to have a usb nearby for charging purposes. I consider this feature a plus, as I hate having to search for batteries when the need arises.<br /><br />To conserve power with this mouse, there is a switch to shut it off. Plus, it will automatically shut off, to preserve power, if there is no movement for several minutes. This is good because, with regular use, you will need to recharge this more than you realize and saving power makes a difference.<br /><br />Computers need a means for navigation and that requires a mouse of one type or another. You could go for the boring, ordinary mouse with buttons to click and nothing more, or you could have a little fun and get this wireless mouse from PEIOUS. I vote for the latter. It might only be a mouse, but the lights and the elimination of batteries make this a standout mouse and one I recommend.",

Not sure of the total weight, but did not notice any flexing or leg slippage once set.  Once I changed over to my Nikon D750 w/ 200-500mm...I felt a little less secure that this was the right setup. Anything smaller (video camera, Lumix fz200, spotting scope ,etc) I am 100% confident in these legs.  Not really fond of that particular tripod head but was all I had when the legs arrived. Big problem was that it would not fold back neatly because of the design of the head....  So, having recently purchased a Sirui K40x for my super heavy Bogen legs, I was so wowed by that head that I bought a smaller Sirui head k30x . I could not be more pleased with the function of either. I'd never heard of this brand or seen one, but took a chance based on the first few reviews. Really like the hook at bottom.. Never been a fan of the twist locks, but I can change. Only other CF I have is a small Monopod for traveling in a suitcase.  I have no regrets ... I got a quality product.. Light and strong. Don't think I'll ever pull the leg off for a monopod, but it's nice to know it's there if I need to splint a leg or need a walking stick. Have yet to try it on a sandy beach... that will be the ultimate test for me. Have always used heavy aluminum pods that are easy to disassemble and clean from sand and salt water.

I tried it again with the TV turned off and then it worked fine at power up and paired perfectly.  I had great hopes for this device and it seems to work fine if you have a QWERTY keyboard displayed on the screen or an actual input area for you to type in.  In some places it simply doesn't work, such as YouTube.  The search screen for YouTube does not display a keyboard, but the letters in alpha order and you have to move around and select letters instead of just being able to type in your selection.  My wife uses the TV a lot and watches almost everything from YouTube, so this isn't going to provide much of a benefit over the remote that came with the TV.  There is nothing really wrong with the keyboard; it is just that various services provided on the TV just haven't standardized on one way to do alphanumeric input and on searches.  Some of the services just aren't responsive to typing from the keyboard, which is too bad.  The keyboard is a great idea and may work for you; just be aware of the limitations and that you probably can't type in your search strings in all places on your Smart TV.",

I've had this extender installed for about two weeks now and it's definitely improved things.<br /><br />It took several tries to find the right location to push the Wi-Fi signal where I wanted it outside, but once that was figured out, we were set. Relocating this unit is pretty simple - once it's tied into your router, just plug it in and watch the lights until you see all green. I repeated this process four times before I had the exact spot I wanted. It never failed to connect after being unplugged and moved.<br /><br /> It actually throws the signal significantly farther than expected. I can use my tablet sitting on the bridge over the creek, about 250 feet from the extender's location in the house - in a straight line. I'm pretty pleased with the performance so far for my simple needs. It's really close to the speeds our direct router puts out, so we're not seeing any noticeable signal degradation on tablets, cell phones or a laptop outside.",

I love how much adjustment there is with this mount once it is up. It is easy to pull the set away from the wall & also turn it to the sides. The tilt angle is also adjustable but requires hand-loosening & then tightening a couple of fasteners. There are 2 height positions for the TV that are pretty easy to change &, at least with my Sony, more room for adjustments based on how the brackets attach to the TV.<br />The instructions for this mount are pretty good but there is a lot of measuring, math & test fitting involved in setting up the height which isn't addressed in the instructions. The kit comes with a variety of hardware options & even comes with a small, magnetic level to help position the mount, an HDMI cable & some cable organizers.<br />The only issue I had was concerning mounting to the brick chimney. There are a variety of holes laterally for different stud spacing but only two sets vertically. The vertical spacing was not to my liking because it pushed the mounting holes too close to the edge of the bricks. I was also a bit weary of the plastic inserts to mount to brick or concrete walls instead of the metal expanders but the screws bit hard and gave a good, tight feel when they were snugged.<br />Now I just need to sort out those wires.",

First, it's a lot less likely get get tangled or kinked which is great. It can be tangled, of course, but it is a lot less likely. The other big plus is that flat cables seem a lot less likely to break near the connectors for some reason. As such, I expect this cable to last for a while and to be easily accessible as long as it's not tangled up with other cables.<br /><br />In use it works great. It charges my phone without issue and it also works just fine as a data cable.

            "question": "title: Mind blowing wifi coverage, but had some minor hardwire issues\ntext: Honestly, I wish I had a tried a Wifi6 mesh system sooner. This is NIGHT AND DAY difference over my previous D-link router + extender. I thought that since both my router and extender were D-link and had the ability to \"communicate\" with each other, it would work pretty well, but honestly even when it \"worked\" it was pretty laggy, and outside on the porch it would drop to single digit speed tests, if anything at all (forget about streaming for backyard movie nights!).<br />This system, however, is incredible. I'm now getting nearly 200mbps outside where I used to have nothing, and in most of my house I'm hitting my maximum 250mbps that I'm paying for with my internet service. Everything responds quickly and smoothly, and I love the control that the TP link system gives over what devices are connected (it alerts me when a new device connects!) and being able to set restrictions and time limits as well!<br />The one downside, however, is the physical ports. For starters, there are only 3 of them per unit. If you use ethernet backbone to connect them, that leaves only one on the primary node (one for the internet connection to the modem, and the other going to the second node- only one available for anything else). In my case, I have an ethernet cable going to my desktop for work (the most reliable connection), and another going into a telephony system. The 3 port limitation would have been difficult if I hardwired the satellite, but thankfully I didn't have to. The wireless mesh over 6Ghz actually works quite well so far so I managed with only the 3 ports on the primary one.<br />That being said, at first I had a major issue with the speed on my hardwired connection. The desktop claimed to only connect at 100mbps. Meanwhile, if I turned on wifi I was pulling 250mbps. That can't be! Many chats to customer support and we couldn't figure it out until I switched ports on the Deco and now I'm getting the full 250 over ethernet. I don't know if it was the port having trouble or just reseating the wire that did it, but I never had that on my previous D-link router, and it had more ports too in case I needed them.<br /><br />In a nutshell, I got it working, and for what it is supposed to do, I'm VERY very impressed at the performance. But the hardwire hiccup and limitation in number of ports available makes this a 4 instead of 5 star review.",

            "question": "title: awkward design, hard to get used to, finding it irritating to use\ntext: So, I have this backpack, and it is kinda weird. You have to see my pictures as it is a different style than what is pictured in the description. I don't really care for it as it is awkward to handle.<br /><br />--It is a basic looking back pack. I like the bright orange in contrast to the black. That is likely the only feature I really like.<br />--The bag is deep. It measures roughly 21\" long, this includes the top portion being unfolded, as that is usable space if need be. @17\" wide<br />--The access to the main compartment is a velcro closure with adjustable hook straps for added security (and to keep added length folded down). Unlike many backpacks, there is just one slit opening across the top with velcro to close. Most backpacks have a zipper closure, as well as going a bit down the sides, for ease of access. I'm not fond of how my bag is styled in that way.<br />--Inside the great nylon cavern of the main compartment, it splits into several more compartments and pockets, including a lightly padded pocket.<br />--exterior pockets included two open side pockets that would be great to stick a water bottle in or an umbrella.<br />--two good sized compartments on the front- one zippered, one velcro flap closure.<br />--one rear zip pocket, as well as what appears to be a pass through strap of material- perhaps for use on a luggage handle?<br />--padded shoulder straps are comfortable. Straps include d-rings for clipping keys, or whatever to.<br />--overall feel is good<br />-I cant for the life of me find the USB port that it claims to have. I don't see anywhere for headphones, etc.. so I don't know what is going on.<br /><br />The part that makes me really not like it is the main opening. First, it is deep, which can be good or bad depending on your needs. But, the top folds over way to easily. So it takes some major rooting around to find stuff, and the flap wants to fold down, and if it manages to fold down, it is easily closed tight by the velcro. This is super annoying if you want to get into and out of the bag repeatedly. I'm just like STAY OPEN. If it zipped, it would be better, then at least if it folder over it would be easy enough to get it, but with the velcro closing it up, it is irritating.<br /><br />The other aspect that I dont care for is the hooks on the front. Well, they are anchored on the front, but since they are used to help keep bag closed (in addition to the velcro), when they aren't hooked, they are dangling down the front. So you have those kicking around in the front, and the shoulder straps and all its extras kicking around in the back. It isn't as clean or stream lined as it could be. It feels frumpy, I am sorry to say. I was hoping to replace my every day carry bag- I like to have a little cross body purse, plus a back pack for all my additional daily needs. This might get old quick as I try to get used to the odd features.",

I sent it off to Canon to fix under a warranty claim and they had it back to me in about 3 weeks.  From that point, it worked for about another 8 months before reverting back to the same state of disrepair.  I resolved to just use MF on it, however, just having this lens attached to my camera nearly instantly drains even a full-battery....must be some kind of short in it.<br /><br />Regardless of the failed mechanics and weird behavior, the glass was good and I really liked the way it handled indoor light....great colors and warm tone, nice FOV.

In addition to these 2 connection options you can connect via optical cable.<br /><br />I followed the instructions - plugged the HDMI cable (included) into the ARC HDMI port, plugged the sound bar and subwoofer into the surge protector and turned everything on. The TV automatically recognized the soundbar and changed my output.<br /><br />The sound bar automatically connected to the subwoofer without me doing anything at all. I decided to move the subwoofer to another area of the room - I unplugged it, moved it, plugged it back in and it again reconnected without any problem.<br /><br />I was able to pair the system with my iPhone without any issue and the sound is stunning.  From the rich bass of the subwoofer, the vibrant midtones, to the crisp highs - every note is clear and distinct.<br /><br />While I have a true 5.1 surround system most of the TV broadcasts are not going to utilize that type of system and the sound is actually richer through this sound bar with a subwoofer.<br /><br />This soundbar can be easily wall mounted using the included template. Since I have my TV on an entertainment center base I’ve used the “AmazonBasics Universal Sound Bar TV Bracket - Adjustable Arm for Mounting Above or Under TV, Black” to mount the sound bar below the TV where it hangs perfectly level.  Since this is a universal bracket it requires a bit of figuring out the best configuration but it comes with everything you’ll need and it works great.<br /><br />The entire system is intuitive and user friendly. While many sound systems require hours to hook up and figure out how to use correctly this one is so straightforward. The remote doesn’t have a bunch of excess buttons that you’ll never need or use.<br /><br />The new sound technologies Sony employs with this sound system are incredible.  The “Immersive AE” function changes the directionality on the sound and is remarkable.<br /><br />In my instance my TV remote was able to control it immediately with no issues.<br /><br />I have always been impressed with the quality of Sony’s audio and video products - they are constantly innovating and improving on their products and in my experience they hold up far better than other brands.<br /><br />I highly recommend this soundbar for anyone looking for an easy way to improve the quality of the sound from your TV - and you’ll be pleasantly surprised by the rich sound it will deliver regardless of what you play through it.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review.

Therefore, with a nearly $400 device, it will make sense to try to keep it safe. This case does the job well enough. The front cover uses magnets which activates the screen when opens, and turns the screen off when closed. This does not work for the first couple of minutes as you turn on the tablet, but this is because the OS is booting.<br /><br />There is one gripe, and that the tablet doesn't do well with Qi charging pads. This is a minor annoyance as of now, but I am a proponent of Qi charging as I feel more devices should have this feature. Therefore, case manufacturers should make a better effort in making sure that their case will work well with such charging pads.<br /><br />[Update - 2014-06-28]<br />The magnets for the case is falling out. I would have thought they would have screwed or glued the magnets in. Now, every time I open the case's cover, the magnets come along with it. Since I bought this on 2014-02-08, this is less than 5 months since it is malfunctioning. Now, I can only hope that the company will honor the warranty.

The battery lasts 2+ days with reading books all day. I love the green color, I'm glad they are finally adding colors to the mix instead of just black. Much lighter than previous fire tablets.<br /><br />Cons: The newer they are the faster they seem to fail. This is my 4th kindle 2nd 10\" the first 2 were 7\". My first one lasted 5yrs befor the charger port failed. The second was the same but only lasted 3yrs. My first 10\" barely lasted a year. I used it until bed time, got up the next morning and nothing. It won't come on. I tried several different things but nada. I think the battery gave out and when I have time I plan on taking it apart myself to try to repair it. I'm hoping my new one is a little better. Aside from those issues the only thing I can say is since it is large it can be hard to hold so for any one with hand or arm issues that may need a holder so they can use these easier. They are much lighter than the older models. Also the screen on every kindle fire I've had had bad glare so I buy IQ Shield matte screen protectors for them and it's fantastic.<br /><br />*** All of the mentioned tablets were only used by me and were well taken care of.

            "question": "title: Not A Stellar Case\ntext: Okay, before I mention what is wrong with this case, I will mention two things that are right:<br /><br />1. The leather feels so soft.  For a mass produced case, they did a good job at this aspect.<br /><br />2. The strap, which I am going to call a negative down below, does look cool if you are thinking of your KFHD as an ebook reader because it resembles the straps that are sometimes found in books.<br /><br />Okay, done with the good.  Now for the critique:<br /><br />1. The spine likes to stay open.  By that I mean when you open the device and then close it you have to use the strap to hold it shut because it will not do so naturally.  Since the device turns on and off when you open and close it, this means that the device will waste power staying on because it thinks that the case is open.  There are many ways to avoid this, but they manufacturer did not try to.<br /><br />2. There are no pockets to put note cards or business cards.<br /><br />3. There is no loop to hold a stylus or pen.<br /><br />4. The case is open around all sides.  This isn't a design flaw, but if I were the company I would offer a zippered version to protect the device from rain.<br /><br />5. The strap SUCKS!!!  I mean really, it takes effort to properly close this case!  Why not design it not to need one like my Toshiba Thrive case, or design it with a magnetic clasp like my Kindle Touch case?<br /><br />6. The rotating mechanism is pretty cool, I have seen similar for other devices, but it is pretty tight.  Perhaps this will loosen up, but after 3 days I still report this to be difficult to turn.<br /><br />7. The hand strap is useless.  If you hold it open like that, the device is secured only to one side and can flap about.  If you are going to put in a hand strap, this should provide secure and stable device placement.<br /><br />8. And now for the most annoying factor:  they get a point for designing a case that can sit at several angles, but then loose several million for designing it so that NONE of those angles are comfortable.  They range from pointing slightly down to pointing slightly up, and all of them are best if the device is at or within 6\" below eye level.  If you sit it on your desk and not a long way off, it is not angled enough for a good view!  Seriously?  Didn't they test this before going into production?<br /><br />My advice to the user is to find another case.<br /><br />My advice to the manufacturer is to redesign.  And while you're at it, please send me a free one of the new cases after the redesign so that I don't have to buy a new case!<br /><br />One more word about the price.  I know that this is a high end case with the rotating feature and all, but anything over $30 is just ridiculous!  I got mine free in exchange for this review (sorry about that, but I am always fair and I have never been bribed in my reviews), but I wouldn't have paid for it if I had to do so!",

            "question": "title: Dynamic \"Quality of Service\" Feature Helps Out Home Network With Many Attached Devices\ntext: I'm not a gamer, but I do have around 30 devices connected to a home network.  These include WEMO switches, Amazon Echos, a smart TV, a playstation, Kindles, iPads, printers, and smartphones.  The &#34;dynamic Quality of Service&#34; feature of this NIGHTHAWK X4 ULTIMATE GAMING ROUTER (R7500v2) seems to prioritize these devices, so that all of them are more responsive (faster connections) than they were with my previous router (a rock-solid NIGHTHAWK (R7000)).<br /><br />When this NIGHTHAWK (R7500v2) is set up, it recognizes all of the &#34;Internet of things&#34; devices for what they are.  In the &#34;attached devices&#34; list, these aren't given device names (e.g., &#34;iPad&#34;, picked up from the device itself) but have &#34;n/a&#34; in the name column (and you can't assign them names even if you know them by the MAC numbers).  I don't know exactly how the &#34;Quality of Service&#34; feature performs its magic, but now when I ask an Amazon Echo to turn on a light or a fan, the Echo performs the task immediately--instead of with a delay while it searched through the router's list of connected devices for the correct one.<br /><br />The PCs and other devices that use lots of bandwidth (instead of being on standby much of the time) seem to connect faster, and they test (using OOKLA) at significantly faster Internet speeds.<br /><br />My R7500v2 is broadcasting signals for both bands (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz), and my compatible devices connect with the 5 GHz network whenever I ask them to.  However, I don't use the 5 GHz band for anything at present (because it's easiest to have everything that uses a printer on the same band with the printers).  Thus I don't know whether the router frequently drops the 5 GHz signal, as other reviewers have stated.<br /><br />I've used several high-end Linksys routers, and they have performed very well.  However, I find that Netgear routers lose their Internet signal far less often, and almost never require rebooting--when Netgear routers need rebooting, the issue is almost always traceable to Comcast problems.<br /><br />Another reason that I prefer Netgear routers over Linksys routers is that Netgear has no limit (or a very high limit) on the number of devices that you can list by MAC number and tell the router to &#34;allow only these devices to connect to the network&#34;.  I use this feature as an extra firewall, and find that the Linksys 25-device list is inadequate for my needs.<br /><br />Finally, the Netgear &#34;Genie&#34; app for managing the router settings is clear and easy to understand.  The initial setup for this router is easy, unless you have a nonstandard home network (e.g., my router is connected with the Comcast-supplied equipment in &#34;Bridge&#34; mode), and/or you interrupt the setup routine before it's run through all its steps.  If you do land in setup limbo, you can start over by resetting the router to the factory settings (use a paperclip to hold down the reset button for 10-30 seconds--light will blink; unplug from wall for 30 seconds; follow Quick Start instructions again from beginning).",

            "question": "title: Disguises Kindle Keyboard, 1st Gen Kindle Fire, or Nexus 7 as Beautiful Book\ntext: [[VIDEOID:mo4US5M5XC9DUY]]This case, the VERSO PROLOGUE (MARBLED BLUE),  is so pretty, I'm going to use it for my Kindle Keyboard even though it doesn't fit quite as well as the case I've been using (the [[ASIN:B003DZ165W Kindle Lighted Leather Cover, Black (Fits Kindle Keyboard)]] ).  Because the Verso cover is designed to fit a number of e-readers, and the Kindle Keyboard is the thinnest, the cover's \"book spine\" is a little wider than I'd like.  But the spine itself is fun, showing a gold-stamped book title,\"Verso II\".<br /><br />I tried this case with all of my small e-readers:  the 1st Gen Kindle Fire, the Kindle Keyboard, and the Nexus 7.  As you can see from the accompanying video slide show, the case works (or as the manufacturer would say, \"is compatible with\") all three.  However, depending on the device, you may have to adjust the elastic bands so that they don't cover important keys or buttons.<br /><br />The best fit is with the 1st Gen Kindle Fire.  The device's power button and ports are at the center bottom, and the ambient light sensor is at the upper left corner, so the case's elastic bands interfere with nothing. The Kindle Keyboard is a good fit.  The case's elastic bands come close to covering the outside keyboard keys at the lower left and right, but the bands can be pushed back for clearance; and the bands don't interfere with the Keyboard's power button on the lower edge. The Nexus 7 (which is slightly larger than the Fire, and slightly thicker than the Keyboard) is a snug fit, but the case still works.  The elastic band at the top right must be pushed back to clear the Nexus 7 power and volume buttons located on the side  edge at the top right.  Although the case covers the Nexus 7 speaker on the back, the sound is the same whether the tablet is in or out of the case.<br /><br />Once adjusted, the elastic bands stay in place, because there is a rubbery material on the underside of the elastic that grips the surface beneath it. (I have screen protector film on my Kindle Fire and Nexus 7, which seems like a good idea whenever a case holds the e-reader by elastic bands instead of a hard plastic shell.)  This Verso case lacks any elastic closure, magnetic closure, or automatic wake/sleep feature.  However, the case stays closed fairly well (like a book), and offers good protection if your device is placed carefully (not tossed) into a bag or tote.  There is a pocket on the inside cover that is supposedly for \"important papers\", but it only holds a few thin items.  Apparently you can use this pocket to hold your e-reader when the cover is folded back.<br /><br />According to the retail literature that comes with it, the Verso Prologue Marbled Blue case is \"compatible\" with the Kindle Fire, Kindle Keyboard, Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (7.0), NOOK, Kobo Wi-Fi, Kobo Vox, Sony Reader Daily Edition, Sony Reader Wi-Fi, BlackBerry Playbook, HTC Flyer, Dell Streak 7, and other 7\" tablets (e.g., the Nexus 7).  This case is extremely well made, using superior materials, and makes your e-reader look like a beautiful handmade book.",

It seemed like the Sony WF-1000XM4 and Bose Quietcomfort earbuds were the top picks in this space. After a lot of research i went with the Sony earbuds. Besides their sound and level of ANC. i liked the fact the Sony earbuds still had a lot of playback control available from the earbuds and you can use either earbud individually. I also felt like the fact that they sit in your ear canal rather than on the outside would contribute to the noise cancellation.<br /><br />The earbuds felt and sound good and the accompanying app was nice but the case had a cheap, almost cardboard feel. My main issues were, although the earbuds never actually fell out of my ear, I think their top-heavy design made them feel like they were always about to fall out. The bigger issue i had, which won't apply to everyone, is how much effort went into getting them to sit correctly in my ear. Even with twisting, and pushing, I could never get the right earbud to fit securely in my ear like the left one did.<br /><br />After a day of wearing the Sonys i decided to pick up a pair of Bose Quietcomfort ear buds as i already had a pair of Quietcomfort 35 over the ears that i loved, i figured I'd give Bose another shot. As soon as i opened the Bose, I immediately fell in love. Besides the unboxing and charging case feeling more premium, the earbuds went into my ear effortlessly and securely. I wore them the first day and they stayed in place all day and sounded great.<br /><br />Although the Sony WF-1000XM4 is a great set of earbuds, The Bose earbuds have the same functionality, sound and ANC but are designed in a way to comfortably fit a wider array of ear shapes and at a cheaper price.

I have a habit of misplacing one or more of them on occasion and I was hopeful this organization system would help keep them all together. It does work well for that purpose but in my opinion this is overpriced and cheaply made.<br /><br />At a glance, this is a small and lightweight case, made of plastic with aluminum framing. The inside is a foam rubber sheet with grooves cut into it that hold on to small objects, in this case thumb drives and two slots for SSD or laptop hard drives. It’s not as big as a typical briefcase, and in fact will likely fit inside most briefcases.<br /><br />My complaint is that it is cheaply made, especially when considering the price ($40 as I write this). The plastic handle and the clasp are both chrome-plated plastic that is easily scratched and flaked. The clasp itself isn’t even straight on my unit and there’s enough play in the hinge that I expect it to break off completely over time. The no-slip feet on the bottom aren’t even straight, and they’re installed loosely enough that they can be turned and wiggled freely. The foam insert has the feel and consistency of packing peanuts, cheap material.<br /><br />There are better solutions for SSD and thumb drive storage. This one is so cheaply made and so overpriced that I have real difficulty recommending it.",

It isn't the greatest, the instructions are poorly written and the build quality is marginal, but it does work pretty well. I'm giving it 4 stars just because it's price is so good. This thing is sold elsewhere for as much as $90.<br /><br />The user interface, (button) is a bit confusing but once you play with it for awhile and figure it out, it does seem to work as described. The alignment of the camera with the little hole on mine was a bit off, but it was pretty easy to &#34;tweak&#34; it into alignment. The video quality isn't too bad as long as you have adequate lighting. The sound pick up is amazingly sensitive. Need to buy a micro SD to use it. It doesn't come with one.<br /><br />It is an ingenious design but could have been implemented just a bit better. Still it is convincing enough and unobtrusive, The way it is made, it completely comes apart quite easily and I can see opportunities to retrofit the electronics into any number of other objects.<br /><br />Overall, if you're not a little bit tech savy, you may have probelms with this, but it's a great buy for the money if you don't mind having to play with it a bit to get it to work the way you want.",

            "question": "title: Not bad.\ntext: Was actually pleased by the caps when they arrived. I used to be particular about keycap quality, but in the last few years the quality and cost of keycaps have been awesome; I'm so thrilled about those new to the hobby (although it's still expensive). When GMK 9009 was originally announced, I thought it was the perfect modern edition of classic beige. Everyone should have a good classic beige set, and 9009 is it.<br /><br />Right now, my workhorse keyboard is a polycarbonate 910 with Cherry MX Grays and third-party springs (I forget the weight). Typing on it is a dream every day, and the keycaps can enhance the experience. I prefer PBT on this keyboard because it has a more pleasant, thocky sound than ABS caps. There's also a bit of tactile pushback with ABS, at least from what I noticed. While I love 9009, I'm not thrilled about ABS. Sure, ABS is cool and develops a nice shine based on use, but I prefer the consistent feel of PBT; having some keycaps stripped of their coating from use while others still feel new can throw me off. All that to say that I'm glad I was able to get this 9009 set in PBT. I was very hesitant, though, because the price for this many dye-sublimated, PBT keycaps was too good to be true.<br /><br />When the package arrived, I was disappointed to find that there was no shipping box. The keycaps arrived in their manufacturer box with a shipping label slapped on it. Not only can that increase the chances of theft, but the shipping label covers the rendering that shows all the keycaps included. So now I'll have to resort to the listing to see what all should be in the box. However, nothing appears damaged. The keycaps come in wonderfully secure, plastic trays, three stacked on each other. There are a lot of keycaps here, so most keyboards should be covered. Of course, not everything will be perfect; for my 910, the Home cap is taller than the rest of the row, and there is no 1u Tab cap, nor a R1-height Fn cap. There's only one 1u blank keycap, which doesn't sit flush with the rest of the caps in its row. Minor gripes because I know my layout is particular.<br /><br />But, again, there still is a great amount of keycaps so I'm sure most boards will be covered.<br /><br />Now, as for the keycaps themselves. As I mentioned, I was very hesitant when the package arrived, but overall I'm pleasantly surprised. The keycaps are slightly thinner than enjoyPBT and BSP caps, and the stem can be a bit snug, but not too tight so that they don't come off easily. The sublimation is very good; I haven't noticed any that appear sloppy. Some num pad legends seem a bit thinner than others, but overall the legends are consistent and have that Cherry-legend appearance.<br /><br />I wish there were more color options here, but for the price I can't complain. Truly, at $40, this set is an amazing bang for the buck.",

            "question": "title: Night Owl’s Rejoice!\ntext: If you are someone who tends to stay up later than your partner watching TV but don’t want the volume to disturb them this is an excellent option.<br /><br />I have tested this set on 3 TVs and my computer.  This will work only if you have RCA audio outputs (red and white outputs), a headphone jack or an optical output.  One thing to not on this, I’ve found the optical output tends to have a lag in sound while when hooked up through the other outputs there is not.  Once plugged in you may have to search and adjust your TV’s audio output settings to find which one works for this set.  I found depending on the TV they may be labeled differently.<br /><br />Adjusting sound can be a bit tricky.  Press the sound adjustment buttons on the headphones + or - wait a second then press again.  If you just keep tapping or hold it down it will not change.<br /><br />The battery life on these headphones is excellent and the charging base is small and convenient.  I have this set up next to my bed so they are always ready to go.<br /><br />In terms of sound quality, I would say they are a bit over average.  While this would not be a pair I would use for listening to music if I wanted the experience of truest high definition it is definitely adequate for watching TV.<br /><br />This is a solid pair of wireless headphones for watching TV.  While they don’t have high definition sound quality they do sound good.  Make sure you have the correct output ports available prior to ordering as not all TV’s have multiple sets of RCA output ports and if your’s are already occupied switching it every time you want to use these is a pain.<br /><br />I’ve really enjoyed having this set and being able to enjoy watching TV at night without keeping anyone else awake.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review.  I enjoy writing them as I value reading other’s reviews when I’m making a buying decision.

Yes, the camera has a plastic body, but it's been very durable while travelling and seems no flimsier than any other electronic device made today.  The plastic body is one reason why the camera is so easy to take everywhere.  It's light, compact & not a chore to haul around, which is nice.<br /><br />Rather than a short battery life, I have been suprised at the long life of the battery that came in the camera.  I bought an extra battery because I expected it to run out quickly, but I've never used it.  I've never needed to.  During a 4-day weekend in the mountains, I plugged the camera in at night, and was able to record any time and every time I wanted all day long each day.<br /><br />The noisy zoom lens?  I don't know.  My model doesn't have a noisy zoom lens. I can barely hear it when I use it, and have never noticed the sound of the zoom during playback.

I have learned through experience that Philips makes good headphones, though, and based on the brand name I selected this set of headphones to try out. So far I am pleased with them.<br /><br />As mentioned, these are on-ear phones. For me, I prefer over-the-ear phones which are more comfortable most of the time, and that is probably the only complaint I have with these. After wearing these for a while I need to take them off for a short time before I can put them back on and keep going. This is true with most on-ear phones I have tried. For on-ear phones, though, these aren't bad and the ear fatigue is less than many I have used.<br /><br />This particular set boasts an on-demand bass boost, and for me that's a huge plus. Most headphones have the bass boost baked right in and there's no way to turn it off. I don't care for heavy-handed bass (gives me headaches), so for me it is a feature I will leave turned off most of the time. However, there are times when the bass needs some help, and these deliver. When activated, there is a very noticeable increase in bass response that will certainly make some people happy.<br /><br />So, about the sound profile... A set of headphones isn't worth any amount of money if they sound bad. These are fairly balanced phones when the bass booster is turned off. The highs are bright and clear, the midrange is warm and the bass is present but not overwhelming. The bass becomes front and center when the boost is turned on.<br /><br />These connect via Bluetooth and they pair and establish connection quickly. I have no complaints.<br /><br />These are good on-ear phones that work well. They're reasonably comfortable, and they connect well. The most interesting feature, to me, is the on-demand bass booster which is better than having a continuous bass boost that's built in. For me, that's a major positive point and is the reason I will continue using these.  These sound good.",

However, I have a Lifeproof fre case on my phone, which means that the charging port is much more recessed than normal.

The reason for five stars is the design, which is convenient for folks who own USB Type C devices.<br /><br />My acid test is to overfill a drive. On a poorly made thumb drive once the file is at capacity the files will become corrupted and are impossible to remove. In essence, the drive is useless. This one passed that test with no problems. I did not test the transfer rate because the only port I had open on my Thinkpad T61 was an ancient USB 1.1. It was slow (as expected), but the transfer was steady and error-free.<br /><br />If there is a flaw, it's the loop for attaching this to a key ring is too small for one. Not a show stopper for me since I normally do not keep a thumb drive on my key ring, but if you do, this is NOT going to fit (and that I know of.)<br /><br />This is definitely for folks who are now using USB C. I would have loved it even more had it come with a piggy back adapter on the C side for a USB micro adapter as well. Perhaps the next version will, but since USB C seems to be the coming thing, perhaps my personal wish is not practical in the long term.",

The track wheel works pretty well but it's kind of like driving an old truck with very loose-feeling steering. It works, it just spins fairly freely so it feels strange at first. I like it though! The optical on this works well, I'm using my laptop's sleeve as a mouse pad and it works great!<br /><br />Taking away one star because the usb dongle on this has WAY too tight of a fit! I can't even get it into one of the laptop's usb ports and it's a matching branded Acer Vero laptop, same color and everything! But I put it in a port on the left side and had to nudge it in a bit harder than anything else and it went in. I tested it in various other usb ports around my house and in ALL of them it's a very snug fit and in some, it's hard to push it in. The dongle itself isn't bent or anything so the only thing I can think of is poor design.<br /><br />Other than the dongle issue, this is one of my favorite wireless mice I've had! It has a low profile and feels very natural in my hand. I would just use the trackpad on the laptop but it doesn't have physical click buttons, you have to push the trackpad down in the corners to click- I really don't like that.

            "question": "title: Dead simple to setup if you have a compatible router! But decide if you need this...\ntext: I happen to use a D-Link DIR 1360 as my internet router at home, and while it does a decent job broadcasting signal around me, it is located at one corner of our home which means the opposite corner of the house has too many barriers for a fast signal. And if I want to take my laptop out to the porch? No reliability at all!<br />But with this placed a few rooms over from the router, it has greatly extended my network and the speed of things nearby it. It was super simple to set up, too! I'm not sure if that's just because I happen to have a D-Link router, but all I had to do was press the setup button on the router and extender while plugged in next to it, then once setup I could unplug and move it wherever I wanted to extend to. No app or IT knowledge required! Literally press the button, wait a few minutes for the lights to turn green, and good to go! The access point matches the original name of my router, so it is all completely invisible to the user. The device picks whichever device is closer / stronger and automatically connects to it without any user intervention, much like a cell phone. Now, this is only possible because my router supports this mesh-style setup. Otherwise you'll have to do one of those alternative SSID things where the device sees two networks and has to decide which one to connect to. The first was is preferable obviously, and just works better in addition to being cleaner.<br /><br />With my laptop in my living room (on the other side of the house from my router), I used to get somewhere between 20-40mbps in my speed tests downloading. That's not terrible, but I'm paying for 300mbps service! But with this plugged in the middle of my home, that jumped to 80-90mbps reliably! Still not the 200+ speeds I get if only a room or two away from the router, but definitely an improvement by almost 2x... and spots outside on the porch that rarely had coverage before now do.<br /><br />HOWEVER, like any extender, this WILL introduce some lag to your network. This is the part I was warning about in the headline, as most people think extenders will improve your performance across the board, which isn't true. While my download and upload speed improved, my Ping time degraded from 8ms to 14 (lower is better). That extra hop from the extender back to the router has a cost. Now, that difference shouldn't make a huge difference in most things, 14ms is still pretty respectable, however a larger ping lag can effect real-time performance like lag in multiplayer games and video call performance. Arguably, in those cases, a lower ping is more important than higher speeds. So if I'm having trouble with gaming lag or video call echo, I'd probably unplug this and go with the original weaker signal to the router directly. But if I'm going outside, or just streaming Netflix etc, than the download performance is more important than the ping. So, make your decisions wisely... I've seen too many people running multiple zoom devices over lockdown and think a wireless extender is going to solve their problems, but in fact just made everyone's zoom calls worse! But this isn't the fault of the device, that's inherent of how all extenders work. So, I'm still giving this 5 stars for being an excellent instance of what it should be: a way to boost transfer speeds and extend range that's dead simple to set up.",

I like that they aren't hurting the inside of my ears like the buds do and i like that they are usb-c charging so i only have to have the one cord with me for trips. But the fact that you can't adjust the wire in the back is a major flaw.  I have a small head I guess.  When I put these on and lean back on the couch or in the car, the wire pushes the headphones almost up to my eyeballs.

            "question": "title: Very Well-Made 3.5mm Audio Cable\ntext: I wear headphones daily and I have had difficulties with the cables either failing or getting twisted and kinked. I looked to this cable to help resolve those issues. So far, it has definitely exceeded my expectations and has worked much better than I expected. Though it’s “just a cable” there is a good bit that can be said for it.<br /><br />This is a 4' stereo audio cable with 3.5mm plugs on either end. Even while still in the package it’s clear that this cable is a bit more substantial and rugged compared to most other audio cables available. It is a heavy-gauge cable with woven nylon casing that is actually very difficult to twist though I suspect if one tried hard enough to kink the cable it could be done. The jacks are gold-plated and rather than just molded plastic they have a metal cap that screws down to make the jack much more sturdy and give it a much more sophisticated look. This is not a run-of-the-mill plastic-coated audio cable with cheap jacks on the end but rather it is a quality cable that’s worth buying.<br /><br />I replaced the cable on a pair of headphones with this one and plugged into a music player and noticed no difference in the sound quality. The primary difference between this cable and the one it replaced is an integrated microphone on the cable which is not something I need anyway.<br /><br />I am happy with this cable and am pleased to recommend it. It is very well made and it works well. It is a little more expensive than other audio cables available but you get what you pay for with this cable.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.",

            "question": "title: Well designed and pro-level construction and features for transforming an iPhone 6 into a camera\ntext: I received this as a free review sample. When I accepted this for testing and review I was a little skeptical. However, this has turned out to be a high-quality kit that will transform an iPhone 6 or 6s into a decent hand held camera, yet it will not interfere with other iPhone functions. With the case and attachments in place you can still make and receive calls, text, browse the web, etc.<br /><br />This is actually the foundation for a more sophisticated set of lenses that will accept add-on lenses like the [[ASIN:B018TQUEYI 010 | bitplay Portable Add-on 3X Telephoto Glass Lens Compatible]]. As you can see from the product description this kit already comes with a basic wide angle/telephoto lens combination. It is not plastic junk, but a serious lens with a precision metal body that screws into this case. It has two parts - one lens screws into the other for combined or separate effects - and it is as good in quality and construction as the lenses that I used with a vintage Nikon SLR.<br /><br />The case itself can be quickly removed to reconfigure your phone back into a ... phone. But while it is in camera configuration mode it feels just like a hand-held with a choice of grips, an integrated tripod adapter and even a leather strap. The case does not interfere with any phone function, and especially the iPhone's camera and flash. More importantly - for me - the case offers excellent protection. The lip that is slightly raised about the iPhone's screen is curved inward and adds protection for that critical area. The body of the case and two of the grips are textured so you can maintain a firm hold on the phone while shooting, even if your hands are wet.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is not a gimmick or novelty - it is designed for folks who take photography seriously. I could not find a single flaw in the design from a photographer's perspective; nor could I find any faults from a build or design perspective. This is obviously not for casual users, but if photography is your passion and you own an iPhone 6 or 6s, this case merits serious consideration.",

            "question": "title: Great sunglasses; okay smartglasses.\ntext: As sunglasses, they are phenomenal. They even fit my slightly narrow face. I own a pair of Gascans that I've had for almost eight years and they are my favorite pair of sunnies. Wanted something now that I'm starting to run more and the sun can sometimes cause a harsh glare.<br />So nice sunglasses with the ability to track my exercises? Sure; why not.<br /><br />As sunglasses they fit a bit loose on my head, but with the same material that I used on my Gascans I was able to make them tighter by fitting some foam on the hinges; this way they wouldn't (and didn't) loosen while running.<br />They fit great and are an excellent addition to my running routine. The sun isn't as vibrant as of this writing, but I will continue to use these throughout the winter as the sun's glare on the snow will be an issue.<br /><br />I tried these on without the smart devices enabled at first to get an idea as to how the sunglasses were by themselves. The box comes with all the electronics apart from the glasses, and the glasses come in a nice semi-hard shell with the additional lens inside. I then equipped everything in one bout.<br /><br />The earphones fit okay, but they did tend to slide out at times during the few times I've used this so far while running. No issue in terms of when I'm in the gym, however. Syncing from my phone has never been an issue, though I hate carrying it with me.<br /><br />As smartglasses, they're okay; nothing revolutionary, and it's up to you if you want to pay the premium price for something your phone already can do, provided you take it with you. As the coach doesn't do as much as I'd like as of this writing, as I already have most of my workouts set. I suppose it may not be entirely geared for me as the only exercise I do outdoors is running; the rest is all in the gym.<br /><br />The music does tend to cut in and out, and I wound up just shutting it off completely after a while. I may look into more comfortable replacements, too.<br /><br />As sunglasses, these are phenomenal. The perfect sunnies for triathlons, methinks (when they're not wet). But as for smartglasses, a novel idea but needs improvement.",

I have the 12&#34; for quick cooks - 2 hours or less and the 18&#34; for 6 hours or less.  I use both when I want real extreme smoking!  The trick is to fill the smoker tube with pellets and use a little torch with map gas to light the pellets, wait at least 5 minutes and blow out the flame and set in the smoker or barbeque.  Remember to set the tube on some aluminum foil because the ashes will fall through the grates and make a mess.  Note:  if you light both ends of the tube, you get double the smoke but half of the time before it goes out.  I have bought several of these for gifts for friends with smokers and they all say great things about this product.<br /><br />Update:  I have a RecTec smoker and I use their wood pellets because the burn so clean as compared to my old Traeger with Traiger pellets.  I tried using the RecTec pellets in my smoke tube this past weekend and I didn't get as large of volume of smoke but they burned a lot longer than the Traeger pellets.  I switched back to the cheaper Traeger pellets for my smoke tube because I like the larger volume of smoke and because I set the smoke tube on some aluminum foil, I don't get all of the ash in my smoker.",

            "question": "title: Seems to Work Well; Bad Documentation\ntext: I have been interested in a device that can find hidden cameras for a while as we do tend to travel periodically. This device seemed like a good one and I wanted to try it out before I travel again. It seems like a pretty neat device that works fairly well, but it is hamstrung by very poor documentation.<br /><br />This does more than just find hidden cameras. It is able to pick up Wi-fi signals, wireless phone signals and more. The sensitivity is very much like working with a metal detector - turn it up too high and it becomes nothing more than a sight and sound show; turned too low and it hardly sees anything.<br /><br />With the unit turned on and set to a reasonable initial detection level I set about looking for devices in my home office. I have several Wi-fi connected devices and I usually have my smartphone there too, and I messed with this detector until I found the level where it was able to find everything. I did not try going near the router which is in another room but I imagine that one would require another sensitivity adjustment.<br /><br />Most of the functions are self-explanatory, but some took a little trial and error to figure out. This is where good documentation would come in handy, and unfortunately the documentation with this device is poor. It's sufficient to identify the different functions of the device and where to find different components, but the actual descriptions and explanations of the functions are written in very poorly translated English.<br /><br />Aside from the documentation, it would have been nice to have a carrying case for this device for storage and travel. That's a minor gripe, though.<br /><br />I am happy with this device, though better documentation would make it much easier to use right away. It has some useful functions that will appeal to wary travelers, and it seems to work well once you figure out the right adjustments.",

Previously, they have been out of reach because of the price of the devices as well as the price of the bulbs that required replacement.<br /><br />In the last few years, LED projectors have really come down in price.  When it became attainable for me, I started to try out various models and in the last two years, the prices have dropped to the $100-$200 range, even for native 1080p projectors.<br /><br />As I've said, I have tried out various models and had problems with most of them, problems ranging from not being bright enough, 720p native, unable to fully focus the corners, or even that it needed to be very far from the screen to project a big picture.<br /><br />The Vimgo Smart Projector is a stylish little projector that has a nice, vertical design that takes up less space than a normal projector.  It has a good-sized speaker behind the cloth-covered side panels.  The sound isn't high fidelity, but it can get pretty loud.  Many other projectors barely comes with a 10w speaker or worse.<br /><br />It is rated at 300 ANSI Lumen, which isn't going to work well in direct light but quite adequate when the lights are turned down.  There are no dark corners and I find the picture to be evenly lit.  The keystone functionality is great.  You can adjust the \"tilt\" up and down as well as left and right.  You can also zoom the picture out and if all else fails, each corner can be adjusted individually.<br /><br />I really like that there is a motor that performs the focusing.  With manual focus, I often get up and focus the projector, just to get back to my seat and figure out that the focus wasn't that great.  With the focus controllable from the remote, I can sit close enough to really see if I got it just right.<br /><br />The Android system works well for plex and jellyfin, which I have installed.  Unfortunately, Netflix and Amazon Prime Video has DRM that prevents them from running on this projector, but that is easily remedied by projecting from your phone or with a FireTV connected to the HDMI (the USB port outputs enough amps to power the FireTV).<br /><br />Here's a tip:  Install the Android TV Launcher by downloading the APK file to a USB drive, then choose the USB app from the projector to install it.  It is not only a better-looking launcher, it will also give you access to the full Android system settings.  I wouldn't suggest setting it as the default launcher, though because I haven't found a way to launch the built-in launcher manually.<br /><br />I also found that the Vimgo projector actually has a shorter throw distance than my previous projectors.  I'm able to get a larger picture when set up at the same distance as my previous projectors.  I actually had to zoom out to make the picture a little smaller to fit my projection screen.<br /><br />So to conclude, the Vimgo projector does not have any of the problems that I found in my previous projectors.  It is stylish and compact with a great picture and good-enough audio (for small gatherings, not for a home theater experience).",

I’ve consulted on large projects and written about security vulnerabilities within networks for trade publications.<br /><br />This is a field I know well.  Over the years the technology has improved and become less and less expensive to produce.  It is now practical to install security systems that would have only previously been used in commercial settings in residential.<br /><br />As with all security systems my advice is never use cloud based recording - this opens your entire network to not only the company who you are giving blanket access too but also to hackers.  The same is true for WiFi.  Obviously WiFi is more convenient but if your privacy is a concern this really needs to be taken into account.  Hackers have become quite adept at hacking into WiFi cameras and being able to not only watch your feed but control your cameras and access your entire network.  If you choose to utilize WiFi cameras take the time to understand your router and employ proper VPN protocols.<br /><br />In terms of this particular wireless WiFi camera by MYPIN it can accept up to a 128GB TF card.  While this would provide plenty of space to record if only set to motion unless you subscribe it will only save the previous 7 days worth of data. This is ludicrous - this is the company manipulating users into having to subscribe.<br /><br />The app “Vicoo” has the most absurd privacy terms you will see on any security camera app.  To be clear, I tested this with a phone I do not use on a network I temporarily set up for only testing this and after testing I completely wiped the phone and removed the network.<br /><br />To summarize the privacy terms YOU MUST AGREE TOO (the fine print most people skip to the bottom of and hit Agree) you MUST give this company COMPLETE ACESS TO ALL OF YOUR VIDEO CONTENT.<br /><br />Here is the fine print for you to read:<br /><br />“with respect to Content (including all related intellectual property rights) you submit or make available for the Vicoo Services, you grant Vicoo the following worldwide, royalty-free, nonexclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicensable and transferable license(s), as applicable: the license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, make derivative works of, publicly perform and publicly display such Content on the Vicoo Services solely in connection with providing you the Vicoo Services, as permitted through the functionality of the Vicoo Services and under these Terms.

You also hereby do and shall grant each user of the Vicoo Services a non-exclusive license to access and use your Content through the Vicoo Services, as solely permitted through the functionality of the Vicoo Services and directed by you and under these Terms.”<br /><br />If this doesn’t give you enough of a reason to not purchase this product or anything that uses this app read on...<br /><br />If you want to use any of the primary features of the app, AI, alerts, etc YOU MUST SUBSCRIBE.<br /><br />In my tests battery life was subpar with similar cameras although video quality was adequate.  Due to the nature of the security issues with the app I was unwilling to leave it hooked up long enough to do my full battery of tests which require over a month of use.<br /><br />The app is not dependable nor is it user friendly.  They force users into signing a completely unreasonable privacy agreement which forfeits any privacy you have - they own your footage and can distribute it HOWEVER THEY WISH.  Beyond this ridiculous agreement the company forces users into using their paid services in order to use any of the semi advanced features.<br /><br />I CAN NOT RECOMMEND ENOUGH THAT PEOPLE AVOID THIS PRODUCT AND ANY OTHER THAT USES THE VICOO APP.  ALWAYS READ THE PRIVACY AGREEMENT PRIOR TO INSTALLATION - KEEP IN MIND WHAT YOU ARE ALLOWING OUTSIDERS ACCESS TOO.",

I use it about once a month for a week at a time when I go RV camping to power my laptop. On its own, the laptop’s battery would only last at most 2 hours. But with the laptop plugged into the power bank, after I’ve used my laptop for 2-3 hours, the power bank charge has only dropped from 100% to as low as 77%--that extrapolates to 8-13 hours which is way more than I would usually need. So I no longer have to worry about my laptop running out of power. When I’m done, I plug the power bank into my RV’s 12V outlet and it recharges back to 100% in about 4-8 hours depending on how low its charge is. Between my monthly camping trips, when the power bank sits idle, it maintains its full charge without my having to recharge it.",

            "question": "title: Good IP Camera with a Couple of Minor Quirks\ntext: An IP camera is an inexpensive and straightforward way to add a little extra security to your property, whether it is watching a door, monitoring a hallway or even just keeping an eye on the dog while you’re at work for the day. This is one such camera by Foscam, and it seems to work fairly well in my testing. There are a couple of minor issues I have seen, though nothing that I would consider a showstopper.<br /><br />This is a small and lightweight camera, about the side of a baseball, and it is hinged such that it can be angled in a range of about 300 degrees of coverage if it is placed properly though in practical use (meaning, when it is placed on a wall and anchored to it) it is likely to be positioned more like 70-90 degrees. It also rotates on the base, so it can be configured to point to just about any target from where it is anchored.<br /><br />The base itself is detachable and the whole camera can be popped off the base with no tools. To me this represents a concern. It means that someone can simply take the camera from the mounting place if it is low enough, using no tools. I like being able to rotate the camera on the base but I also like knowing the camera is not going to get taken easily.<br /><br />Setup of this camera is very easy and I was able to get it connected to my network without too much effort. That said, I struggled a little bit with the Foscam software and it took me a little while to get the software talking to the camera. I have had this trouble with another Foscam camera, and the problem seems to be the software - very specifically the IP Camera Search Tool utility - and not the hardware or the network. I was able to find the camera in the monitoring client.<br /><br />Once the camera is connected and available it can be logged into directly. There, the user has some control over a multitude of settings including firmware updates, login credentials and more. I like the interface even though it is somewhat basic as it is easy to navigate and is completely accessible from a web browser.<br /><br />The monitoring client software allows for more control, which includes concentrating on a single camera if there are more than one connected, scheduling, playback and more. In addition to the software that runs on a computer, users can connect to it via smartphone if they have an iPhone or an Android. Windows phone users are unfortunately out of luck.<br /><br />The camera resolution is very good and is detailed with fairly accurate colors. This certainly is not the same as a camcorder, of course, but it is sufficient to recognize faces even at a fair distance. The night vision (infrared) is excellent and is sufficient that I was able to read a sheet of instructions that was held in front of the camera.<br /><br />I do not like the LEDs on the camera, though... It is very hard to place the camera inconspicuously and have it remain unseen in the dark when it lights up with a ring of LED lights. This is the one major issue I have with this camera that I think needs improvement. It’s not a complete deal-breaker, but consider the possibilities when an intruder sees the camera and knows he or she is being recorded. These can be turned off in the settings and I highly encourage doing so.<br /><br />The camera has a micro SD slot near the hinge where storage can be inserted. It is unfortunate that there are no cards in the box though this is a minor gripe. I used an 8GB card for testing and the camera was able to record to it without trouble and I was able to control this from the monitoring client.<br /><br />This is a decent little IR-capable security camera. So far I am pleased with it, though there are some minor quirks. It’s a relatively inexpensive camera and is an easy way to monitor areas of your house and record what is going on when you can’t be there.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

            "question": "title: Design is more than just looks\ntext: As 'cool' as the cloth covered outer jacket is, this retro look on this cable has a real purpose. Most cables use PVC for the jacket and the dielectric properties will cause some signal distortion when they go through their store/discharge cycle. Granted, the amount of charge a PVC jacket will store and eventually discharge is minute and also will not affect charging. However, many of us use our cables to sync to laptops and other devices and with the cloth jacket this effect is so minimized as to be nominal.<br /><br />There are other reasons why I awarded the review sample I received five stars. At the top of the list is this cable not only supports charging my Note 3, but also is flawless when it comes to synching it. Not all cables I own will synch (sounds incredible, but unfortunately true), This one will and my guess why it's done so without errors so far is the gold plated connector that do aid in conductivity. Another reason for the five stars is the heavy duty housing for the connectors and how they manage to be both thin enough to be unobtrusive and substantial enough to assure a long service life. There are even strain reliefs on each end of the cable to minimize wear that can eventually cause diminished transmission at the weak points in any USB cable.<br /><br />Finally, the ends mate perfectly with every device with which I've tried them. I have only tested the micro USB end on my Note 3, but have tested the USB A end on my laptop, various chargers and battery backups and the fits on all are precise.",

            "question": "title: Already Enjoying This!\ntext: I thought long and hard about a tablet, knowing that for me it would basically be a toy. Plus I already had a Nook Color. When the iPad2 reduced in price, I thought about getting one of those, but decided against it for the following reasons: (1) no Flash--and yes, I know HTML5 is going to make that obsolete, but in the meantime many websites have a lot of money invested in Flash animation and even restaurants use the silly format to show you their menus (geez, just give us a LIST already--I don't need pretty pictures to find out if you serve something I can eat) and (2) I'm already invested in the Android market and would have to buy many iPad apps that I already have free from Android.<br /><br />I have not even used it for a week yet, but this a preliminary review with some information I saw requested in other reviews (not necessarily here at Amazon).<br /><br />UPS delivered this a little before 6:30 p.m. I immediately plugged it into the charger and left it alone. It was charged by 10 p.m. (it might have been earlier, but the unit was away from me and I heard no bleep or flash that might have have indicated the charge was finished). So it does not take six or eight or ten hours to charge as I have seen claimed on other sites. By midnight I was attached to wireless, had gotten into all my accounts and Android apps and was happily surfing and rearranging my home screen.<br /><br />I used this over the weekend at a science fiction convention. I did not use it constantly, but turned the screen on and off all day for about a 12-hour period, reading Facebook and blogs, checking the news and weather, looking at the convention schedule online, playing short You Tube videos, etc. Nothing excessive, but sometimes did have it on for a half hour to 45-minutes at the time. I also do not have a lot of widgets going, like the Accu-Weather and news widgets that come pre-loaded on the home screen. (They delete easily.) In that 12-hour period it never got below 78% on the battery. It's very quick and fast and responds to a Targus stylus (rubber tipped) wonderfully, much better than my Nook color. The resolution of the screen is impressive. Maybe it's not the new iPad's \"retinal display,\" but it's very, very sharp and bright, even though I keep my brightness turned down to save power. I downloaded the Nook app and the magazines I subscribe to look gorgeous and are simple to read; if not, a tap of the screen makes the text bigger. The unit also comes with Zinio preloaded, an app I plan to use to subscribe to non-US magazines. Kindle books look nice as well, but to me this is too large for marathon reading sessions. I prefer my Nook Color for that. Like my Android phone and my Nook Color, it connects to wireless like a dream, which is more than I can say for my laptop.<br /><br />Things that might lead you to choose another tablet: (1) The camera is nothing special. It takes good close ups, but further away was problematic. However, I was in a low-light situation each time. Taking photos outside may be totally different. Why Samsung chose to remove the flash I have no idea. Silly, really. But who buys a tablet to take pictures with? (2) With a stylus I can tap to enlarge an image (like Google Maps), but not make it smaller and there is no plus or minus sign on the screen as on my Android phone. (3) Blogger doesn't work in the browser; you have to download the Blogger app, but that works well. iExit doesn't work on it, either. Rats. (4) As at least one other person mentioned, the screen cap button is right in a place where you can hit it easily. I thought of a good use for it this weekend (took a screen cap of the online schedule for the convention I was at, made a short-cut of it to the screen, then pulled up the screen cap for reference rather than going to the web page all the time). Very convenient! (5) Hate the pre-loaded websites in the browser, but I have seen this on other tablets. Apparently we the public are stupid (or lazy) and can't find our own favorite websites and bookmark them. [eyes roll], and (6) my Bluetooth keyboard won't work with it right now because there is as yet no driver for Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich).<br /><br />I hope to check back with further comments.<br /><br />[A few weeks later after I bought this, my husband found an Asus Transformer (TF300) at a good price. It appears to be just as good as this Samsung and the camera is better. It has a zoom and does take a better photo. So if you were looking for a tablet with a better camera the Asus Transformer may be for you. Note: It doesn't have a flash either.]<br /><br />[Update July 31, 2012 to answer \"How long does the battery last\"?: I was sick and tired of not seeing any Olympic equestrian coverage except for a couple of hours in the wee hours of the morning, so downloaded the \"Live Extra\" Olympics app from the Android Market. This carries live streaming of events as well as archived events. This morning I watched about two hours of live streaming of the jumping finals. When that ended I watched six hours of cross-country eventing replay. Then about an hour and forty minutes of the replay of the jumping. I had my brightness at about 35%. This got me down to 10% of the battery from a full charge. Quite satisfactory.]",

It’s okay, but be prepared for some minor adjustments. The Pros: price. It’s much less expensive than most of the others. It’s also quite minimalist - no thick bezels. It’s made of a flexible silicone material - that’s both a pro and a con - the pro - it’s soft on your tablet - no scratches. It’s also somewhat flexible - I installed mine vertically in a tight space and there’s no room to slide the tablet in from the side. Instead, I have to seat it in the bottom mount and sort of snap it into place in the top. Given the flexibility of the material, this works fine. The cons: included with the mount are 6 each screws and wall anchors - no spares and no washers. The anchors don’t have any lip on the end so a couple of mine dropped into the wall cavity, making it necessary to go buy some spares. Also, the screw heads easily pull through the holes in the mounts when tightened. I fixed that with a handful of small washers which should be included with the mount kit. Also, my tablet (an old iPad Air 2) Is quite slim and doesn’t fit snugly in the mount so I put a short strip of thin silicone insulation behind it to better hold it in place. There is a slot in the center of one mount to allow access For a charging cable. Thoughtfully, it appears to be even wide enough for the old style wide Apple connector. Included is also a paper template for various size devices and a stick on cable retainer. Aside from the minor complaints about washers and wall mounts, I’m satisfied with the kit.",

            "question": "title: Very Good Mid-Range Wireless Router\ntext: I recently purchased one of these routers as a replacement for my Linksys WRT54GL, a stalwart in the realm of home networking. My Linksys router is healthy and it works but it does not allow me to set up DHCP reservations without a 3rd party firmware update, and it does not support Wireless-N. After searching for a good balance between functionality, quality and price I settled on this router by NetGear. So far I am very pleased with this unit, though I had some minor issues when setting it up.<br /><br />Setup of NetGear routers (including this one) is simple and easy. There are two methods of setting it up, using the Wizard CD or going in manually. For users not too familiar with setting up wireless networks or routers, using the CD to get started is a good option. More seasoned users may prefer to work without the CD and work directly with the router. I chose the latter of the two. Even so, tapping in and finding any given setting is relatively easy, everything broken down into several pages. Because the router configuration is accessed through a browser, manipulating the router configuration is very much like accessing a web page and should feel familiar.<br /><br />The factory-default username, password, and access address are printed right on the router itself so there is no risk of losing this information at any point.<br /><br />I connected 3 laptops, one at a time, to the wireless network and encountered my only difficulty with moving to this router. Because I retained the network name and key I expected the swap to be seamless and mostly invisible, but my systems each complained when tried to connect, stating that the network configuration had changed even though I retained the settings, the type, key and everything else. To get each system working I had to delete the connection completely, then I allowed each to redetect wireless networks available. Two of them came up without any further incident, but one of the laptops required a reboot before it would properly connect.<br /><br />Signal strength is important when it comes to wireless networks. My Linksys router gives me very strong signal strength, and I was fearful that this new NetGear router would lack the same power to broadcast. Happily, it broadcasts brightly enough that I have had no problems with connectivity due to losing signals. It is *at least* on par but seems to be stronger. My router lives on the second story of the house, while my personal laptop is in the basement.<br /><br />As soon as the router was configured and provided a connection to the internet, I logged in ang got a surprise - it is configured by factory default to look for firmware updates every time I log in. This is fine as logging into the router becomes an infrequent activity after a while, though up front it can be annoying to have to wait for it to download and then update itself.<br /><br />I have had no connectivity issues or drops since setting this router up.<br /><br />The DHCP reservation and MAC filtering work well, which are the two advanced features about which I care most.<br /><br />Something I have not seen in any other router up to this point is a USB port. According to the documentation, the router can be set up to provide persistent storage through the network by simply connecting a USB hard drive (or even a thumb drive) to it. I have not tried this but I absolutely plan to put this to work, which will make sharing files between the different computers simple without having to make several copies. It should be noted, though, that this could be a risky practice if using to access the same file frequently from multiple points.<br /><br />Looking through the options that can be set up, I found a keyword-based page filter, QoS settings and a lot of other features I have not previously seen. For a mid-range wireless router this one has a generous set of features. Of course, the standard features are there - firewall, MAC filtering as mentioned above, different encryption key types and a lot more too.<br /><br />This is a very nice router with a nice feature set. It is very easy to set up, easy to configure once it's running, and so far has proven to be stable. If you need more than a basic wireless router, consider this one as a good candidate.<br /><br />===<br /><br />UPDATE 12-01-2011: It has been over a year and a half and I still have not had any trouble with this router. I have seen some of the negative reviews and detailed reports of issues but I have not encountered any problems up to this point. It has been stable and reliable for me. I have noticed that the surface gets a little warm; I suspect if I kept it in an enclosed area that it could potentially be less cooperative but there's no reason for me to move it as such.",

            "question": "title: Does Not Retain DPI Setting Reliably; Slightly Smaller Than Average\ntext: I selected this mouse to be a spare for when I am on the go. Amazon-branded things are often of good quality so I was hopeful for this mouse. I came away a bit disappointed due to a couple of issues I have had with it.<br /><br />This is a basic wireless mouse, suitable for surfing the web, working on documents or similar tasks. It’s not particularly good for gaming as it is not designed for such. If the goal is to have something that will allow you to casually use the computer for basic tasks, this one will serve. If you need a heavy-duty mouse for frequent use or you need a gaming mouse, spend a little more and get a more solid mouse.<br /><br />One of the issues I have with mice is that I have huge hands and finding a mouse that fits my hand properly is a challenge. This is a smaller than average mouse, so it really doesn’t work for me. That’s not a big deal; it was designed for the large majority of people with smaller hands, so I can’t criticize this mouse for its size. It’s in that weird in-between size - smaller than the average desktop mouse but larger than a travel mouse.<br /><br />The real issue I have seen with this mouse, though, is with the DPI setting. After idling for a little while, the mouse has a very nasty and predictable habit of resetting the DPI mode automatically. This is the only mouse I have used that has exhibited the problem. This impacts me when I am doing photo editing or using a graphics program and I need fine control. Sure, I can hit the DPI setting and get it to where I need it to be easily enough, but I should not have to do this over and over, particularly when I need the same setting all the time.<br /><br />Other than the DPI setting, this mouse works exactly as expected. It is a decent mouse if you do not need predictable DPI settings. If you need a mouse that retains your settings, or if you need a larger mouse, or if you need a heavy-duty device, this is not the right choice for you. It’s fine for travel or casual use.",

It meets all of these needs perfectly.<br />Set-up is easy, and the software that ships with it is perhaps not world-class, but does the job.<br />Installation and user documentation are clear and easy to follow; however, I have not needed to use the manufacturer's technical support, so I cannot comment on the quality of that.<br />Note - I purchased this device based more on price than features, so if you are looking for a full featured DVD ROM, or one with more sophisticated software, you may want to shop around and compare others on the market.  If your needs are relatively simple, such as mine are, and want to burn data, music and video at an affordable price, this model is a solid buy.",

I've been trying various types of external keyboards as I like to use my iPad on trips and blog as I go.  Having a full keyboard makes life a lot easier.<br /><br />This is the first integrated case/keyboard I've tried, and so far, I like it.  It's easy to set up -- charge it (a cable is provided), pop in the iPad, turn on, pair, and you're set to go.<br /><br />The backlight is fully adjustable - brightness as well as color.  That's a nice touch.  Battery life seems to be excellent -- I've used it 2-3 hours every day for the past 10 days, and it's still going strong and it still hasn't indicated I need to recharge it.  The keyboard size is a bit smaller than my MacBook Air laptop, but after a few minutes, I got used to the slightly tighter quarters and had no issues at all.  Getting it into the case is easy; getting it out of the case takes a little more effort.  When I take it along on my trips, I'll leave it in the case for the duration.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it's quite heavy but given the battery capacity, that's probably not too surprising.  So the trade-off is a slightly heavier case with LONG battery life, or a keyboard-only solution with much shorter battery life.  I think in the end, I'll appreciate the longer battery life and fully integrated case/keyboard.<br /><br />I'll continue to use this over the next few months, and plan to take it on my next couple of trips.  If all goes well, it will come along on a 131-day world cruise early next year.",

            "question": "title: Love this case - exactly what I wanted.\ntext: This case is exactly what I wanted: extremely durable shock-absorbing (read: drop-proof) protection without screen protection. Let me qualify that statement: I did *not* want screen protection. I love the pearl eink display on my graphite Kindle Keyboard, and it now has a big brother. I do not want a screen cover, as this would greatly reduce the screen's otherwise remarkable clarity, adding unwanted elements such as bubbles, surface scratches, and glare to the mix--no thank you. There is a reason I disliked reading on the iPad so much I gave it back (very reflective!). In fact, this OtterBox defender case came with a stick-on screen protector--no way. It would ruin that big, glorious pearl eink display.<br /><br />A screen cover serves no purpose once you remove the device from your backpack/messenger/tote/briefcase for use. Assuming you transport your Kindle device safely in an appropriate sleeve (you put your other expensive electronic equipment--your laptop/tablet in one; your Kindle deserves the same amount of respect), the screen protector is completely unnecessary--the sleeve protects the screen during travel. THAT is when the screen needs protecting--when you are not using it, from the other goodies in your messenger bag/backpack (keys, pens, earbuds, and anything else rattling around in there). Yes, that's right--I'm talking about a Kindle in an Otterbox Inside a sleeve inside your briefcase. ...Inception-level protection. You got it. Better safe than sorry, right? What if they once again stop producing our beloved Kindle DX and something happens to yours? I do not want to have to replace my DX--especially if it has to be with a Fire device (5% the battery life, reflective, heavy, expensive--no thanks!). When you are holding your Kindle in your hand, reading, a screen cover only detracts from the experience.<br /><br />What you see in my pictures is exactly what you get: a beefy, black rubber (not silicone--too easily torn; rubber is much stronger) form-fitting sleeve with an equally form-fitting outer plastic shell. Science geeks like me understand how this works, and just in case you are not one, here is the idea: if you drop your device onto the floor, the outer shell absorbs some of the impact energy generated by the device hitting the floor. It then disburses the remaining energy of the impact broadly into the rubber inner lining. The rubber lining then in turn disburses the now greatly-reduced impact energy into the device. In other words, by the time the force of the impact is filtered through two layers of protection, the second of which is very absorbent and resilient (rubber) the device inside absorbs little if anything of the original impact.<br /><br />I feel very good about having my Kindle DX in an Otterbox Commuter. If I ever had one of those incredibly poorly-designed (read: seriously fragile) apple devices, such as an iPad or iPhone (which I do not, and am not ever likely to), it too would live in an OtterBox Commuter case. OtterBox = the best protection a device can get. I paid $18 including shipping for this. A great price, and worth much more in terms of peace of mind.",

I thought it might bother me and be distracting<br />as I worked, seeing it out of my peripheral vision. However, it is mostly hidden by my hand anyway.<br /><br />There are precious few directions included with the mouse, and what is included seems to be a loose translation from someone<br />who learned English on the internet. I have no idea how to set the side buttons or adjust the speed. My computer did recognize<br />it simply by plugging it in, but there were no driver updates or other information. I'd like to know how to adjust the DPI house settings, which are not an option in my control panel for mice.<br /><br />The mouse is comfy for my hand - I like larger mice so my fingers don't cramp up - I am online for many hours a day.<br />This helps. I don't ever use the wheel, so won't comment on the wheel function.<br /><br />Cons:  This is something that definitely needs to be adjusted in the next &#34;incarnation&#34; of this mouse....<br />The bottom has very slightly raised areas on the bottom. The reason behind this isn't very clear, unless it covers up something<br />on the inside. However, as I mouse back and forth, these raised areas are not smooth, and they catch on my Belkin gel mouse pad.<br />I really don't like that at all.  I am going to use it for a while longer before I decide whether to keep it or go back to my old mouse though.<br />(A Logitec that has served me well for many years.)<br /><br />Not impressive in function, but the design is awesome.

So far, I cannot figure out how to make folders on the hard drive, so everything is just mixed on the hard drive - that means looking thru about 200 titles - Eh - but the point of the hard drive for us is to save the content if we have to replace the Hopper at some point.  It is easy to move the files back and forth.. And you can play the movies from the hard drive.  It did take quite a while to transfer, we had about 50% of our Hopper memory - a number of hours.

That makes it great for refurbishing an old laptop or perhaps turning older hardware into a chrome book or a closet file server at home.

It is super easy to set up in your car and just works. The largest time it took me for setup was to figure out where I wanted it on my windshield.<br /><br />The video quality is good and I like that it also records audio inside of my car.<br /><br />I had issues using the app with this camera. The app keeps losing connection to the camera and I'm not able to update the firmware with it. Luckily, there is a cable to connect it to your computer so you can update the firmware there.<br /><br />Some cool features about this dash cam I didn't realize existed before it was installed and I was driving with it:<br />+ Has lane departure warning visually and with a beep noise<br />+ I think it's also alerting me whenever I'm being radar gunned or there's a speed camera nearby because there's a wifi symbol with a beeping warning that sometimes appears.<br />+ You can replace the included SD card with a larger one so it will hold on to more recordings before overwriting the older files",

            "question": "title: Almost plug and go\ntext: I received this as a review sample and even though I am experienced with setting up and configuring networks, this was so easy that I honestly believe anyone can set it up with the scant instructions.<br /><br />My initial set up was to connect it to my DSL modem just to check it out. Although the instructions are terse, you do need to read them regardless of level of experience. For one thing, it requires you to completely power off your broadband modem. For another, it takes a bit to boot up no matter how you intend to use it. Connecting to broadband was a snap.<br /><br />What I really wanted was a range extender and this was as simple to configure for that as it was to configure for broadband. In that mode, when you first power it on and boot up it takes over  a minute and you may be tempted to think it's broken. Don't. Once it is powered up, like the broadband set up (DSL or cable), the wizard makes it simple to discover your wireless router, connect to it and extend the range of your network. My wireless router turns in a weak -70dB from my master bedroom (measured with [[ASIN:B004EBZX6W Wi-Fi Analyzer]]) and once I installed this in the same room the signal dramatically improved to a strong -40dB. In the same room with my master wireless router this comes in at -47dB while the master router measures in at -56dB. That indicates that the signal of this router is exceptionally strong.<br /><br />There are options for adding sensors for home control. I did not test that set of features because I did not receive sensors, but it is functionality that makes this router/extender a great choice if you do want to pursue home control too. There are IOS and Android apps that can be used in conjunction with the sensor features. Again, I did not explore those and probably will not since I am not interested in them. As a router alone I love this, and especially the overall signal strength and ease of setting up and configuring.",

            "question": "title: Nice watch\ntext: This is my first running watch. Although this is listed as a &#34;Smart Watch&#34;, it's only &#34;Smart&#34; when it's liked to your phone.<br />I use it as a running watch and a fitness tracker and it works great for a beginner like myself.<br /><br />It has built in GPS which is great for tracking runs and walks. It gives you all the basics like pace, cadence, distance, and time. You can configure the data fields to your liking, change watch faces, and download other apps.<br /><br />The GPS is very accurate, I compared the distance on the high school  track and after 14 laps it was within a few feet of the track distance. An app using my phone's GPS was 1/2 mile off. (My guess is that measuring a distance from one point to another will be easier and more accurate than 14 laps around a 400 meter track.)<br /><br />The watch screen is optimized for outdoor running and it works great in the sunlight. As it gets darker you need to tilt the watch at an angle to see the screen. I've run at sun up ad sun down without issue. The screen is backlit but you need to push a button. That's a little awkward when your running, but I rarely run in the dark. I have not had any problems seeing the screen indoors with normal lighting.<br /><br />I picked this watch because of the low profile, large face, and relatively low price as it is an older model.<br /><br />It has made collecting data easy, and I can compare my progress as I work to become a better runner.<br /><br />Battery life is acceptable, I'm charging every 5 days while using GPS 30-45 minutes a day.<br /><br />The Garmin Connect App works well. Link it to myfitnesspal and you have a fairly complete fitness tracking app.<br /><br />Garmin also links with mapmyrun, Nike+, and Endomondo to name a few.<br /><br />This watch also works with an Garmin hear rate monitor. (010-10997-00).<br /><br />There are many great running watch choices available,  so you will want to do your research.<br /><br />Of course you can always just use you smart phone and any of several great free running apps.<br />A lot of those have voice feedback so you don't need to look at your phone.",

Great amount of space, love the charger pack accessory.  My main and very serious issue is this, the main big laptop pocket WILL COME OPEN WHEN PICKED UP BY THE BLACK HANDLE!!!!.<br />please take serious heed to this issue.  It will dump everything out and onto the floor or allow someone to very easily steal out of that pocket.  I had to buy a small lock and lock the zippers together.  That's the only way to avoid this other than using the big yellow handle to pick up bag.<br />I thought I lost all my electronics in the airport one day because my pocket was opened. Thank God some man was honest and stopped me to tell me about it.  My heart dank for a sec when I realized what was going on.<br /><br />The bag is great in every other way. Plenty of space. Plenty of durability, easy wash and clean. After 2 months of every day use there's no fraying no tears nothing to really complain about other than the laptop pocket opening and dumping. It can also hold alot of weight, with that weight it feels great on shoulders and your back.  You really can't tell there 30-40 lbs of books and stuff inside.<br />I would for sure buy another one even with the pocket problem. 5$ for 2 small locks solve that problem and add extra security for your main use. Keeping your stuff safe.<br />The color is vibrant and even being little dirty still shines my beautiful yellow.  I love this bag and it's perfect for the cost.<br /><br />I have NOT been paid for this review nor any other review so far. (I wish I would though).<br />This is, as always, just and only my opinion thought my own eyes and felt with my own hands.  I take reviews serious, as I rely on them to make my decisions before any and all my purchases.

            "question": "title: Flippin' easy to use\ntext: This camcorder is a simple way for you to share videos with friends and family, make and share mini-movies, capture special moments, or film your next masterpiece for YouTube or Amazon.com.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. The \"cool\" factor is off the scale.  Every time I showed it to somebody, they said \"COOL!!!\"<br /><br />2. It uses two AA batteries that are easy to install.  There's a latch at the bottom of the camera - one side has a picture of a closed lock, and the other has a picture of an open lock.  It doesn't get simpler than that, does it?  Push towards the open lock and slide off the panel on the front of the camera from just under the lens.  After you put in the batteries, slide the panel back into place and push the latch back to the locked position.  You're now ready to start filming.<br /><br />3. There are very few buttons required to operate the camera.  Turning it so that the side with the big red button is facing you, the on/off switch is on the right side of the camera.  After powering up, the screen will light up with the Flip logo and then it will indicate that it's ready. At this stage you'll be looking at whatever's in front of you, with a time check at the bottom telling you how much video time you have left.<br /><br />4. Filming is easy - just press the red button to start, and press it again to stop.  The camera will save your creation, tell you how long it is and how much time you have left.  You can zoom in and out by pressing the + and - signs on top of and below the red button. The microphone will pick up and record whatever's going on at the time.<br /><br />5. Playback is a one button operation.<br /><br />6. Deleting your mistakes is a one button operation.<br /><br />7. You can scroll through your videos by using the arrow keys to the left and right of the red button.<br /><br />8. Getting it on your computer is the easiest part.  With the red button facing you, pull down on the latch on the left side, and - surprise!!!  Out pops a USB arm which you then connect to your computer.  Once you're linked up, the Flip Video software will show you the way home.  (It takes a while to pop up)  Choose the option to view your videos, and agree to the terms and conditions, and then the \"Muvee Video Mixing Software\" begins loading.  This is a one time installation.  From there you can easily play, name, edit and share your videos.<br /><br />9. You can also capture still shots from your videos, but you can't use these when making your movies with the software provided.<br /><br />10. There is an option for making a movie, where you can arrange your edited videos, choose from a selection of six movie styles and music, or even add your own music.  Choose your style, click on the \"Make Mix\" button, and the computer does the rest.  If you're happy with the results, you can save the file.<br /><br />11. The camera comes with a wrist strap, a velvet drawstring case, and also the necessary cables to connect it to your television for a bigger view.  There's also a place to connect a tripod.<br /><br />12. There is a \"Help\" feature included with the software.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Being a simple \"point and shoot\" camera, the resolution isn't fantastic, but quite good enough for action shots.  Forget detail close-ups such as words and logos - zooming in and out will just get you various degrees of blurry.<br /><br />2. You'll need to be careful with background noise, as the microphone will pick up the sound of your fan or your stomach growling.<br /><br />3. The video editing capability is limited to the length of the video you want to save, and the order you want to save it.  There are no options for titles, fade ins or outs or any bells and whistles.  If you're filming yourself giving a speech, you'll pretty much have to get it right in one complete take.<br /><br />4. As with all videos, if your hands shake, you'll need to get a tripod, or you may make a lot of people seasick.<br /><br />5. If you have big fingers, you may have some problems with the red button. Once your finger covers the area around the button, you'll have trouble starting and stopping the video.  If you can't get it to work, you may have to use just a fingernail, because if you press anywhere other than dead center of the red button it won't start or stop.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very good camcorder if used for the purpose for which it is intended.  It isn't going to make you the next Stanley Kubrick, but it's a good start.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, October 9, 2007",

This time I was determined to use it to see how it worked.<br /><br />First: this is physically about the size of my hand (with fingers; I have small hands) and heavier than the 1TB drives I have bought previously. Nice and solid. The connecting cord is short as usual. It was immediately plug-and-play, and I registered it. Then I started the backup software. This worked okay, except it took forever. I usually back up my hard drive once a month, and via USB it takes two hours. This one went on for hours, to the point I had to stop it by shutting off the computer at bedtime; it continued backing up for an hour. It did back up my files on my separate D: drive, and also my entire e-mail folder. But it also backed up my C: drive with my Windows setup on it--what's with that? Anyone knows that if your computer crashes, it is better to just reformat and reload. That way you get junk and possible malicious software off as well. So maybe that's why it took so long to back up, it was copying all those Windows files.<br /><br />Not interested in using the other software, but a small 5TB backup for this price is good bang for your buck!

The thickness helps give a deeper sound to your keypresses, which I like. There are multiple length space bars included to accommodate various keyboard layouts (i.e., Full, TKL, etc.) The designs on the keycaps remind me of the show \"Doug\" (I feel old). The set also comes with a keycap puller.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my set came with a blue ink smudge on the  \"3\" key  (see pics). The ink appears to be on the top part of the plastic case, but transferred to the key itself. All the other keys were in good shape.<br /><br />An overall fun set that I'd recommend",

I love these gadget containers so much.. it feeds my organization fix and need to have specific items stored in their perfect pouches! This is a protective case for any small electronic device and/or, cords and accessories. I've used Procase, Caseology, Bag-sport in the past and the AmazonBasics rivals then all- it does not disappoint!<br />-The integrity of the materials used to create the “outer shell“ is there.. This has a bendable stiffness (weird but, true!) and it keeps its shape for the protection of delicate items inclosed- Plus, the placement of the zipper running via the middle of this pouch itself- also helps give the outer edge added support. This has expected finishing details with the zippers edge so, it won’t cause issues zipping the lip of material into zipper when opening or, closing.. (you all know that stuck zipper crisis that happens on your favorite jacket..?!! Yep! The one that gets stuck when you’re usually in a hurry.. I’ve open and closed this x100 with no complaints!)<br /><br />-The interior is made soft with a neon green felt so, it’s protective for enclosed items.. and I love the creature comforts! The bungee bands are perfect! Easy in/out and bands help keep items secure so, they won’t fall out while opening.. this case goes one step further and provides a buckle on the bungee itself- a new feature, even for me! But, my fav. feature is the interior ZIP UP POCKET!! With any gadget case this is my standard criteria.. they all must have an interior zip pocket. Simply put, it is a must have or, I won’t buy- TBH, these cases really need a secure pocket to keep all small objects, cords, SD cards, wall butts, extra batteries, etc.. from coming loose and falling out. I love that this interior pocket runs the length of the case and can fit all my small items securely.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend- these are perfect for travel, anyone putting items in backpacks and wanting to protect expensive and delicate electronics… Or, those that continuously misplace necessary charging cords etc. for their various items- this is the perfect place to store such items.<br /><br />I hope this info helps.. feel free to let me know!",

I have fibromyalgia, so I find that deep sleep is hard to find.  While the watch can't make my sleep better, it does track it in a way that helps me work on my sleep times and relaxation so I can get better sleep.<br /><br />Although, like most fitbits, it doesn't perfectly track all types of exercise, I love how it combines with the heart rate to calculate calorie burn.  For instance, I box and swim.  I can leave after an hour and only have 3,000 steps.  On the flip side, I can go for a lazy little walk and get 5,000 steps.  I've learned that not all exercise is the same, and with the heart rate capabilities and calorie calculation, that this fitbit seems to get it a little better.  I don't worry about the steps quite so much, as long as I can keep working on my heart health and calorie burn.<br /><br />Overall, I really like this watch.  It does show text messages I get and alerts me of phone calls.  I'm pretty okay not being able to call from my watch--I don't want to be available every second of my life, but I do like being alerted to things.  For what it can do, this is a great watch!",

            "question": "title: Awesome Laptop for the Price\ntext: I recently purchased one of these laptops when I stumbled on it here at Amazon. I was very much attracted by the price but was a little wary - this was one of very few laptops with an Intel Core i7 CPU in its price range so I was unsure what compromise might have been made to drive down the price. After working with it and really getting to know it, I can say there were few compromises made - this is an all-around awesome laptop at a really, really good price (as I write, $799). There are a couple of minor things I personally would change but these come down to preference.<br /><br />I will start with something that no one else online seems to mention when describing this laptop - the screen. From reading the specifications to digging around on the manufacturer's website I could find precious little regarding the screen beyond the dimensions. It's the glossy type, so please keep this in mind when shopping for a laptop. Some people prefer a matte finish on the screen to cut down on reflections so if a glossy screen is a problem then this laptop might not work for you. Personally, I like the glossy type of screen as it's easy to clean and since I work in a darker room most of the time I do not have issues with reflections. This laptop's screen is also very bright and clear, brighter than that of my Sony Vaio.<br /><br />Another very interesting feature of this laptop is the keyboard. It has a full number pad on the right side, slightly separated from the main keys. I like that. It also happens to be the chicklet-style keyboard which in my experience has been better at keeping stuff from getting in the keyboard.<br /><br />I made one unfortunate discovery when setting up this laptop - the power plugs into the middle of the left side of the case. That's a very awkward place for the power to be plugged in. What makes this particularly unfortunate is that the plug sits directly next to the output air vent where heat from the CPU dissipates. When not relying exclusively on the battery, make sure you move the cord in such a way to avoid that vent.<br /><br />This laptop has three USB ports, all of which are on the sides and close to the front. This may cause some issues, as both left- and right-handed users may struggle with external pointing devices when using this system. If using an external monitor this may be of no consequence but it's important to keep in mind.<br /><br />To my great joy, it is possible to turn the touch pad off completely. I dislike touch pads and on the occasions where I have to use the built-in keyboard I don't want to accidentally click on something or move the mouse pointer.<br /><br />One final thing I would have preferred to see when it comes to the hardware - a lid latch. I do move my laptop a lot and I would have liked a locking lid. That's purely a personal preference thing.<br /><br />My very first exercise with this system was to make restore media. This process was lengthy, taking about 2 hours and resulting in 4 single-layer DVDs. I then made a second set of restore media - something that some manufacturers expressly prevent users from doing. Once that was done I took a little time to explore the OS.<br /><br />The \"Windows Experience\" numbers reveal a lot about this system. As expected, the Aero graphics are the slow point, but still the number sits around 5.1. This is driven by the Intel graphics chipset and reflects the kind of usage that would occur under light-duty such as word processing or generating email. The gaming graphics, powered by the NVidia card posted much more respectable numbers. The second slowest number was for the hard drive, and considering that Asus puts a 5400rpm drive in these units this is not too shocking. It is easy enough to put a faster/bigger drive in, so I am not terribly concerned with this.<br /><br />There's a fair amount of vendor add-on software, most of which I am not likely to use. I was especially dismayed to see Trend Micro's security solution on there, a packages I personally dislike and will not use. Fortunately, stripping off all of the unwanted fluff is easy enough, but it represents a minor inconvenience.<br /><br />After contenting myself with the Windows side of things, I completely wiped the hard drive and loaded up Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. RHEL 6 is what I planned to run when I purchased this laptop anyway and it is where I can truly explore the system in detail.<br /><br />The Linux kernel reports eight cores as expected. Since the Core i7 is a hyperthreading quad-core, this is exactly what I hoped to see. It also reports the full 6GB of RAM.<br /><br />Boot-up time from pressing the power button to getting the log-in screen (under Linux using GNOME as a window manager) is less than 30 seconds. This is by far the fastest machine with which I have ever worked. Times would be even faster if the hard drive was a 7200rpm or an SDD-type, but it's plenty fast enough to please me.<br /><br />Overall, I am delighted with this laptop. It has a lot to offer for such a modest price and it definitely delivers on its promises. There are a few minor design issues that may or may not matter when using this system, but considering how much machine you get for the price it's hard to pass up in spite of a few minor complaints. This is a great system, worth more than the asking price.",

            "question": "title: Good durable storage, albeit USB2.0 read speeds\ntext: This is exactly what it claims to be. It says very clearly that this is USB2.0 speed, so keep your expectations realistic. It seems like some people rated this poorly because it wasn't as fast as other USB devices, and that's not really fair if comparing to modern USB3 or Thunderbolt speed device made for data transferring regularly. This is more like a write-once-read-many distribution device.<br />I'm attaching speed benchmarks here, and this honestly seems pretty average for a USB2 connected device. I have many old USB2 sticks that are slower. A USB3 SSD connected to my USB2 port faired a little bit better. To be clear and give this a sense of scale:<br />An old 4GB USB stick connected to my USB2 port clocked in at 15-20MB/s.<br />An ultra fast USB3.1 SSD connected to the same USB2 port: 42.24MB/s (so one shouldn't be expecting to a USB2 to be faster than this or even reach this maximum on an average setup).<br />This device, at 30.59MB/s, seems pretty on par.<br />Where you will feel the sting, however, is in the slow 5.87MB/s write speed. That's also not uncommon for sticks like these- they are designed for durability and fast read times, to read data off quickly and conveniently. This is great for distributing finished media for a client to play on a projector, or have your resume / photo portfolio on your keychain. Reading more often than writing. A friend of mine who does wedding video would use a stick like this to distribute the finished event production to the client. It's perfect that for what it claims to be and do, a solid 5 stars.",

            "question": "title: Amazing flexibility, serious value.\ntext: I've got some experience with soundbars having been an early adopter in them along with the first generation plasma televisions. The thought then was to hide the wires and hang everything on the wall as if it were art - the modus operandi hasn't changed, it's just improved and become much more affordable.<br /><br />First, the flexibility of this system makes it great for anyone. You can connect the speakers and create a large soundbar you can place on a shelf or hang up on the wall. This is ingenious - it looks great as one piece and you don't have to worry about multiple speakers. Or, you can keep the speakers separate and still either place them on a table or shelf or whatever, or hang them on the wall. So if you prefer the speakers vertical to the left and right of your TV, or if you prefer them horizontal under the TV, you have the freedom to do either with this system.<br /><br />Next are the features. I found the Dialog settings to be superb. With my previous speaker setup I was always adjusting the volume between quiet monologue scenes and action scenes to hear what was being said. This system adjust everything on the fly automatically so you can hear the dialog without making any other changes.<br /><br />I connected it right up to my cable box with HDMI and it was done. No complicated wires to hook up, one and done.<br />The subwoofer included is WIRELESS! That is terrific. I put it behind my seating and it was just perfect.<br /><br />I tested the Bluetooth feature from my phone - I turned on Pandora and beautiful clear music came instantly through the speakers. Nothing to really setup, it was playing tunes in seconds.<br /><br />All in all I'm really happy with this system. With the flexible speaker setup, the great features, and the price so low you can't even buy a subwoofer for that kind of money, it's a no brainer.",

It's very sensitive. Be prepared to set-up an area for recording if you are wanting to get clean audio. The VIMVIP USB Condenser Microphone came in a fairly plain box with a large hard foam protective insert. This microphone seems to be a great starting point for anyone interested in a higher quality microphone. I can whole heartedly recommend it.<br /><br />The VIMVIP USB Condenser Microphone is a USB interface microphone that is a large step-up in quality to those used to the basic microphones that come with many web cameras. It provides a higher sensitivity to sounds; enabling both a greater ability to pick up lower volume noises and the ability to comprehend higher volume ones.<br /><br />The lower volumes it was able to obtain included whispering, including the mouth noises associated with ASMR videos, and keystrokes from a non-mechanical keyboard roughly 6 feet away [With it's recording volume turned down to 50%]. On the higher end of volume it is able to accommodate singing, yelling, and screaming; by not topping out what it able to accommodate this allowed for wide arrays of vocals and would assist with those wanting to record instruments. I did many different experiments to test the range at home on different days.<br /><br />The VIMVIP USB Condenser Microphone came with a short stand and pop filter that is attached to the stand by goose neck. The stand and metallic goose neck are both adjustable to assist with angling, but it is not vertically adjustable. The microphone, when pointing directly up, is about 26 cm / 10 in in height to the top of the microphone. It has a rubber ball footed desktop tripod for stability. The microphone can also detach from the included stand and be mounted to a standard size tripod or any other compatible stand, making the pop filter necessary depending on setup.<br /><br />I had a great experience using VIMVIP USB Condenser Microphone to audition for a voice acting role organized by fellow fans of an animated series. The VIMVIP USB Condenser Microphone certainly made me sound much better than my webcam microphone is able to do. I have been using this for cooperative game-play online as well. This is a great value, especially at the price point.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review. I hope you have found it informative and helpful.",

It simply doesn't work once the camera is outside of the house.

I had an entire bag of mystery cords that had entangled themselves like coat hangers do in dark closets. So, I sat myself down with the big bag, and a new plastic bin to bring some order to the chaos and bind up the cords. I had several sizes of zip ties with me to accomplish this task. The only black ties I had were these, so I know the issues I had were with these ties.<br /><br />These are thinner than all the rest of my ties. Also, my others were made of nylon and were nice and strong. These black ties seemed to be more plastic than any nylon. They were a little harder to use, being a bit flimsy and much weaker than my other ties.<br /><br />They did hold small cords together, but we're definitely cheaper and thinner.

If it had continued working, this would have been great. But unfortunately it randomly stopped working one day and it hasn't worked since.<br /><br />This little thing has been wonderful. I have a 2018 MacBook Pro (Intel, not M1/M2) and I was looking for a dock that would allow me to use 2 separate monitors with the laptop lid closed, and this one is perfect.<br /><br />It is pretty small (5\" x 2\" x 0.5\", smaller than a Pro Max iPhone) and has a premium metal (?) feel to it (all I know is that it isn't plastic). All you need to do is plug it into the MBP and it works from there (side note: you need to install a quick driver before using the dock, but it's very simple)<br /><br />I appreciate that it allows for pass through charging (which also ensures that high-energy USB devices receive ample power). Additionally, it is really nice that this has both DisplayPort AND HDMI, which is not common based on what I've seen.<br /><br />My only gripe with this is that there are only 2x USB ports (which I knew when I bought it).

We both travel quite a bit and were in need of decent headphones for longer flights (let's face it, the ear buds provided by the airlines just don't cut it). My husband accidentally left his set, in their pouch, in the seat back pocket on a flight last year and was in need of a replacement set for our trip to Germany last week. I was amazed by the price when I came onto Amazon to check - $29.99 was a steal compared to the $80 we spent a few years back! This headset is not the top of the line, but it is effective in canceling out the low aircraft drawl while in-flight. (They are also quite nice when you need to drown out the crying child in 23F. ;)) The battery life is remarkable. I have had to change the battery on my set only twice in the three years I've owned it. The only complaint that I have, which results in the four star rating instead of five, is that after wearing the set for a few hours (i.e., Amsterdam to Houston, TX), my ears begin to ache on the outside. It is almost like the headset becomes to tight over longer periods of time. I tend not to wear earrings on airplanes, so I can rule out the possibility of pinching.

After about a year, I got 3 highlighted problems that keep happening. 1/ the system/bluetooth connection started to fail, it won’t connect to my phone, or is able to connect but has really loud random static. 2/ Random loud static, freaked me out many times. 3/ Won’t charge when i put them back in the pod, the pod is full of battery, but the pair just won’t take power from it. Today i was using the headphone while doin yard work, worked for 15 mins then they has decided to stop working completely, the app won’t recognize them, they don't take power from a fully charged pod. I’m done with these. Their sound worked great, i don’t have a problem with sound quality, it seems like its the connection system fails, between phone and headphones and pod… Spent $200 on these originally, i’ll probably buy a different brand because I want them to last at least 3 years.",

            "question": "title: Good Sound Quality and Lightweight\ntext: I’m never been a huge fan of headphones. I recognize their value and necessity when you want to listen to something but no one around you does. The reason I don’t like headphones is the bulkiness and wires but Soundcore Anker Liberty Air True Wireless Earphones with Charging Case have eliminated these issues.<br /><br />These earphones come in a small case and they are extremely lightweight. You simply remove them from the package, connect via Bluetooth, insert in the ears, and start listening to your favorite tunes. There are no wires so you can move around as you please and because they are so small, you don’t have the bulkiness. Many people, unless they take a close look at you, will not even know that you are using earphones.<br /><br />Of course, what matters most with something like this is the sound quality and these earphones score above average marks for sound. The bass is especially good and I like that I can pause, skip music, take calls, etc with a simple push of the touchpads. And to charge, you just place them back into the case. They claim to last up to 20 hours on a charge, but I haven’t come even close to using them for that much time, so I cannot verify the claim.<br /><br />Soundcore Amker Liberty True Wireless Earphones do not provide any way to control the volume using touch controls, so this is one issue I have with them. But other than that, these are very good earphones and certainly worth a try",

His mother's loose ways leads to a series of events that leave him homeless after his she dies in his arms.  Grief-stricken, Davie makes the decision to leave Blackburn and go in search of his father.<br /><br />Davie could have returned to his grandfather's house but he can't imagine remaining in Blackburn and having to endure the pitying looks and talk about his mother.  After his mother's collapse, Davie runs for help and finds Tom Makepeace.  They get his mother situated in the back of his wagon and are getting ready to head to the infirmary but she passes away moments later.  Immediately afterward Davie jumps from the wagon and runs into the woods.  Everyone assumes he'll return.  Tom even yells into the woods for Davie to come to his home when he's ready that he's welcome there.  Davie has other plans though.<br /><br />He does go to the Makepeace's home but it's only to spend the night in their barn.  He hadn't expected anyone to see him but Judy, Tom's daughter and Davie's longtime friend spots him from her window.  She goes out to see him and reassures him that his mother's body is taken care of and his grandfather will be just fine.  Judy realizes that Davie has to do what he feels is right for him but she also knows that her feelings for him have gone beyond friendship.<br /><br />Davie leaves the following morning with nothing more than the desire to leave his memories behind him.  Life on his own isn't everything he thought it would be and his search for his father proves fruitless.  For years Davie travels and holds many different jobs but through it all Judy and his life in Blackburn remain firmly at the forefront of his mind.<br /><br />THE LONER is sure to pull at readers' heartstring.  Spanning over an eight year time period, you get a lot of insight into the characters' personalities and backgrounds.  I love that Josephine Cox doesn't focus solely on Davie and Judy's story, there are many other characters who possess stories of their own which add a feeling of realism to this storyline.  Davie's journey of self discovery is the main theme and it's a story you won't want to miss.  Josephine Cox is a gifted storyteller who knows how to keep readers engrossed page after page so that the doldrums of winter just disappear.<br /><br />Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",

This one is pretty simple. But it definitely gets the job done. My iPad has another case with a Bluetooth keyboard attached and I was worried it would make it too bulky for it to fit into the sleeve, but it still fits, it’s more of a tight fit but it still works. The only downside is the zipper pocket where I would like to store the charger is pretty tiny and with the iPad in the case it’s basically impossible to get the charger that comes with the iPad to fit in there, if it’s just the cord it would work.<br />I also got a second one for my laptop and it’s works just as well for that. I always carry my laptop in a bag with cushions for it, but the added sleeve just makes me feel like there is a level of extra protection involved.",

            "question": "title: My wattage issue was resolved BUT... read full review for in depth details on how n what.\ntext: I bought this along with a charger box. (TSKYBEAR brand the cheap 10$ one NOT the 20$+ boxes).<br /><br />I was having a wattage reading problem with my new company dell inspiron 14 5000 2n1 laptop.  Kept telling me could communicate wattage and finally wouldnt charge anymore.<br />After researching it was either the charger box or this plug. I went ahead and bought both just incase.  Come to find out it was the box not the plug.  So I never used this item.  But I was prepared to replace and after you open up the bottom of the 14 5000, there was 1 screw and a plug to undo.  And that's it.  Very very easy to replace if you need to do so.<br />It's also an exact copy of what's already installed.  I kept this plug because I have already noticed it's a little loose and will probably need replaced sooner than later.  I'm a site supervisor for a contractor and my laptop gets a lot of use in truck and on site.  So I have my backup when needed. And the 7$ price tag was very shocking indeed.<br /> I hope the above can help someone with the same trouble I was having.<br /><br />I have not been paid for ANY review I've ever left.

            "question": "title: A great value, love the SFF chassis, needs better packaging\ntext: *UPDATED*<br /><br />Update after living with this PC for half a year: Zero problems, fast, and works perfectly for my application (business use). And excellent value. VERY pleased with this purchase.<br />---<br /><br />The PC itself seems to be a great value, and is working fine thus far. The system is plenty fast. The HDD is a bit busy/noisy, and spins a bit more than it should, as though the system is caching to disk constantly. I'm not doing anything demanding with it at all--just light MS Office use and surfing. That's it. No gaming, no video editing, nothing heavy. Note this system is intended for business use, and could not handle much in the way of gaming or video editing, as it has no video card. The on-board graphics use the system's RAM, so anything asking a lot from the system's limited graphics capabilities will slow the entire system down immensely. Luckily, I outgrew DOOM years ago.<br /><br />The SFF case is heavy, but oddly a bit flimsy, with more flex than I had expected for the weight--especially the back panel--mine was oddly bent outward. I pushed it back in/straightened it (I had to in order to plug things in--the plugs were deeply recessed due to the bent real panel--very odd). The chassis itself is a joy to work with though, as the case pops open on hinges without turning a single screw--not even a thumbscrew, and everything is very accessible. The HDD's working vibrations and sounds are amplified by the plastic subframe the drive is mounted in, which acts like an amplifier for the vibrations. I worry a bit that the system's small case will have cooling issues. There just isn't much room in there, and there is only one small 3&#34; system ventilation fan (+ the power supply's fan, and a fan over the CPU). There are vents on the front and rear of the system, but I would like a lot more ventilation--I would have appreciated a perforated lid. Heat is the enemy of all electronics, and my other systems all have more ventilation than this box. Of course, this is an off-lease corporate desktop workstation, and is not designed to have the long life of other systems. The components in the box are the cheapest possible variants thereof, and I do not expect this system to last more than 3-4 years at the most. That said, $269 for a branded Lenovo PC with a 3.2GHz Intel Core i5, 12GB of RAM and a 2TB HDD is a fantastic value. If it dies in 3 years, I will have gotten my money's worth.<br /><br />Important note about the packaging: it simply was not enough protection. I guarantee the system took some hard knocks on its way to me. The UPS driver actually dropped it at my feet from a height of 1'--not kidding! The system is not packaged in an inner box within the shipping carton--the carton IS the box. The small Styrofoam corner blocks used to float the system inside the box are unusually rigid, so much so that they provide little in the way of cushioning, and one of them had cracked in half--meaning the PC wobbled around in the box during shipping. Also, the carton was sealed with &#34;Microsoft Certified Refurbisher&#34; packing tape, making it clear to all it contained a PC. They need to change the packaging--a desktop system simply needs more/better protection than this. I half expected it to be DOA due to the abuse it took on the way here from Arizona.",

A good comparison is those cables are much like an old car - it should get you there, whereas this cable is like a high end sports car - it will get you there lightning fast, without failure.<br /><br />This Cat8 is thicker than some due to the shielding within and additional insulation.  This cable is made to withstand and holdup to exterior environments for the long term. The connector bases are reinforced at each end of the wire which really help hold all of the wires in place even if you have to bend and twist it to fit it within the plug.  The connector plug itself is gold plated which is the ultimate standard in connectivity.<br /><br />This Cat8 Ethernet Cable is 30’ long which makes it absolutely ideal for using it to directly plug your TV or gaming system into your router.  So many of us stream programs and movies via our TV and there is no comparison in speed between a WiFi connection and a wired connection.  For gamers, it is absolutely the way to go - do away with all lag caused by your WiFi by connecting directly to your router.<br /><br />You will not find a better exterior grade Cat8 Ethernet Cable - this is really a top of the line cable that you’ll love.<br /><br />This is a purchase that you’ll never regret.",

            "question": "title: Nice keyboard cover ...\ntext: I'm very impressed with the quality of this keyboard cover.  I honestly was not expecting to be as nice as it is.<br /><br />I can speak from experience when I say that cats, coffee, and a MacBook are NOT a great combination.  I lost an earlier MacBook Pro when cat and coffee collided over the keyboard, so when I purchased my new MacBook Air 13&#34;, I knew I wanted a keyboard cover.<br /><br />This one has a lot going for it.  It fits beautifully -- lays flat, the key covers are precisely where they should be, there's no slippage or any feeling of insecurity about the cover shifting position.  It's transparent except for the colored key caps, so the underlighting of the MacBook Air keyboard shines through.  It's quite thin so it doesn't add much in the way of bulk, either -- but the material feels like it will survive heavy use without tearing or puncturing.<br /><br />I especially like having all the keyboard shortcuts printed right on the keys themselves.  My version, the OX X shortcuts, is easy to read, and the colors actually mean somthing (blue = primary shortcuts, pink = finder, green = safari, orange = iWorks/Mail/MS Office).  It's a nice touch that lends a bit of color to the rather drab aluminum face of the MacBook.<br /><br />If you've never typed on a keyboard with a cover, it might take a little getting used to.  It has a &#34;softer&#34; feel, but key action/etc. is not compromised at all.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a good product, a nice gift for someone with a new MacBook, with bult-in usefulness beyond protecting the keyboard from inadvertent spills and dust.<br /><br />(Although a sample was supplied for review purposes, opinions expressed are based on my personal experience with this product.)",

            "question": "title: Dell Skimped on the RAM; Otherwise, a Decent Multimedia UltraBook\ntext: I have worked with a large number of computers by various manufacturers, and I can say that each one has had its strengths and weaknesses. I was really intrigued by this one with the 8th generation i3 chip – I didn’t even realize that the i3 was still being developed or produced. My experience with this laptop (and its chip) has been a mix of positive and negative, though the positive does outweigh the negatives I see.<br /><br />I will start by addressing the elephant in the room. This system comes with only 4GB of DDR4 RAM. Why? The standard anymore is 8GB unless all you’re doing is surfing the web and writing documents. I am not sure what possessed Dell to release a machine with that little RAM running Windows 10. So, my first order of business was popping the case open and expanding to 8GB, which was easy with a single 8GB stick. There are two slots in there, and 8GB works in one slot, so I am hopeful I can bump it to 16GB.<br /><br />While I was in there, I was in for a surprise. There is a hard drive bay, and it’s empty. The system registers 256GB in a solid state flash, which is elsewhere (I did not see it but I know it's in there).<br /><br />Oddly enough, the Dell software does not recognize the increased RAM though Windows and the system BIOS definitely see it. That’s a minor issue, not a real concern. It does need to be kept in mind though – it could be confusing for the unaware.<br /><br />This is an UltraBook system, meaning that some shortcuts were taken to keep things light and small. The main thing missing is a CD/DVD drive which is hit or miss on UltraBooks. There is HDMI for video output but no other video output interfaces. Surprisingly, there is no USB type C port, but there are three type A ports. There is also an audio jack and an Ethernet port, as well as an SD card reader. The power button doubles as a fingerprint reader.<br /><br />I booted the system, set it up and was on the network downloading updates within about 10 minutes. I was presented with a fairly clean desktop and not too much extra fluff n’ stuff. The system was a bit sluggish for the first hour as things were updated and cached, but it has settled down now and things are reasonably peppy. I have done little with the graphics beyond loading a video and looking at image files, though I expect it will handle light gaming and graphics work like photo editing, though the latter would definitely benefit from having 8GB instead of 4.<br /><br />Windows did not activate automatically and I needed to run the troubleshooter before it activated. I am not sure what went wrong there, but it was a temporary issue and very quickly and easily resolved. I suspect there was a network issue.<br /><br />The screen is slightly less bright than that of my Acer and Toshiba systems, though that’s not necessarily a bad thing. The screen is not as harsh to look at, and the resolution is good, so I would consider this a plus. Pictures and image files look clear and sharp with good color.<br /><br />The real surprise is the sound, which is much better than I expected and is great for watching videos without requiring headphones or speakers. I will still use BT output when I want to listen to anything important (music or a movie), but the built-in speakers are more than adequate.<br /><br />I like the keyboard, though I do not care for the touch pad. The pad is on par with most, neither better nor worse, and I am not a fan of touch pads. It’s nice that it can be turned off, and it is nice that it’s available if it’s needed.<br /><br />The system comes pre-installed with McAfee which is unfortunate but not unexpected. I stripped that joker off in a hurry and installed something for which I already have a full license. There’s also the trial for Office 365 which I unceremoniously uninstalled. Other than those two, there isn’t much bloat on the system.<br /><br />So, my main major complaint is that Dell went cheap and only put in 4GB of RAM instead of 8. Adding 4GB is very economical – less than $30 – so I fail to understand why that shortcut was taken. It’s easy enough to add after the fact, though, and the overall cost of the system is quite reasonable. This is not a heavy gaming rig by any stretch of the imagination, it’s instead a multimedia and light-duty graphics workstation which is what I need the majority of the time. I’m satisfied with this system in spite of the skimpy RAM (which can be fixed cheaply). If you need a system that isn’t for heavy graphics or gaming, this one is a reasonable choice.",

            "question": "title: Incredible Quality Camera at an Outstanding Price!\ntext: I have run extensive tests on this camera over the last several months and I must say I’m very impressed with the performance.<br /><br />Personally I have been working with security camera products for over 15 years - over that time I have installed systems for businesses, corporations and individuals - from large systems to single camera nursery monitors.  I work with a group of security professionals and we regularly consult on large corporate projects and write about security vulnerabilities within networks for trade publications.<br /><br />This is a field I know well - I understand what to look for in quality cameras and the places manufacturers tend to try to save money on which makes an inferior product.<br /><br />Over the years the security camera technology has vastly improved becoming less and less expensive to produce.  It is now practical to install residential security systems that would have only previously been used in commercial settings.<br /><br />This is advice any professional security analyst will provide and what we tell everyone of our clients.  If you are new to home security camera systems, we recommend going with wired (non-WiFi), NVR or computer based recorders run with systems such as Blue Iris.  This type of system is infinitely more secure and stable.  While initial setup costs are a bit more the security it affords is worth every penny.  It always pays to research the products, discuss them with those in the field, understand vulnerabilities and PLAN YOUR SYSTEM PRIOR TO PURCHASING ANYTHING.  If you are at all tech savvy at all you can do it.  While there is a bit of a learning curve it is not awful and in the end you will be thankful for the time you spent in the beginning as it will save you time, money and endless frustration.<br /><br />I have set up, tested and reviewed more security systems and individual products than I can possibly remember.  Without question my go to solution for home security solutions is a computer based, Blue Iris system with PoE cameras run off of quality PoE switches.  This type of system is not only easy to operate but is highly secure.<br /><br />While this camera is not natively a PoE camera I’m happy to share the 5 Pairs Passive PoE Injector and PoE Splitter Kit with 5.5x2.1 mm DC Connector RJ45 Power Over Ethernet by Exgoofit ( https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07F82YK6P/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 ) allow for this camera to operate almost identical to a PoE camera.  The power adapter must be plugged in where the Ethernet cable is plugged in with the first pigtail adapter while the second adapter plugs onto the cameras power port and Ethernet jack.  By utilizing this you can avoid the security concerns associated with WiFi cameras and still only have minimal wires run to the camera.<br /><br />As with any component there are a host of factors to consider.  In terms of cameras more megapixels is not always better.  For instance 2MP cameras often perform better in low light while 5MP will allow for more detail when lighting is good.  This camera is 2MP which is ideal for the vast majority of installation situations.<br /><br />Highlights of this camera include:<br /><br />Awesome Pan Tilt Zoom - Utilizing a 110° wide-angle varifocal lens and the head rotating 355° horizontally and 90° vertically, a 360° view is easily obtained.  This makes this camera an outstanding choice to be placed on a corner of an eave where it can constantly monitor the largest possible area.<br /><br />3.6mm Board lens - in my tests over the last couple of months I have been fairly impressed with the performance of this Fixed Focus 6mm lens coupled with the 1/2.8\" Sony IMX307 CMOS with ICR image sensor.  While this will not allow for near as clear zooming as a varifocal lens it is adequate in most circumstances.<br /><br />Low Light Capability - this lens is decent in low light.  Images are ok at low light, far better than the vast majority of similar cameras in this price range.  IR lighting is dependable and nighttime / low light images are better than expected.  My tests showed accurate images within 75’ of the IR lighting.  By using both 4 IR lights and 4 bright LED lights this allows the camera to capture more details than many of the others on the market.<br /><br />ONVIF Compatibility - critical for using with software such as Blue Iris.  I have set it up with advanced features such as Patrol and Watchdog utilizing multiple detection zones.<br /><br />2 Way Audio - I have had no issues utilizing the 2 way audio through Blue Iris - sound is accurate, clear and minimal lag.<br /><br />Video Compression - This camera utilizes Smart 265/Smart 264/M-JPEG compression allowing for the smallest file sizes while maintaining the highest quality.<br /><br />Great build quality - this camera is well built and will hold up outside in all conditions. That being said this is not a small camera in any way.<br /><br />Over the course of my testing this product for the last several months I’ve been thoroughly impressed.  It loads into Blue Iris without any issue and advanced features work without any trouble.  By using the PoE splitter kit (referenced above) you can easily make this a secure camera by avoiding the use of WiFi.  Build quality is excellent - this is made to last and hold up even in severe conditions.<br /><br />This is a product I would definitely recommend.  While this is the first ENSTER camera I have reviewed I look forward to seeing other cameras they create.  All indications point to this being a manufacturer that builds high quality security cameras that are dependable and made to last.",

I grabbed a few of these over prime day sales. I collect vintage tvs, and wanted to attach a few of these sticks to old tvs for fun. So these LITEs without the 4k is the best bang for the buck, since old tvs can't do 4k anyway. But I noticed something peculiar about the remotes. I made two separate orders and didn't pay attention that the listings were actually different. This listing with over 16,000 reviews gives you a newer remote WITH shortcut buttons for Hulu, Disney, Netflix and Prime. If this matters to you, then you're in the right listing! For some reason, if you prefer the remote without these buttons, then you'll want to order from the listing with over 245,000 reviews.

            "question": "title: You might find a camera with better recording.\ntext: I wished this camera did not pushed the envelope in the 30x optical zoom.  We tested this and on play back the picture was very granular and shaky.  I mean really shaky.  You will need a tripod to reduce the shaking effect.  We compared the output with one of panasonic camera that also had a movie function and we found that was better than this HD camcorder (for about the same price).<br /><br />However, the zoom button was not hyper sensitive and hence you could zoom in and out without the picture looking like you were traveling through the stargate (sorry, for the syfy fans).  It was a very easy and light camera to use and the menu was not overtly complicated in that within one choice you do not have to go into many steps to get what you are looking for - in fact there are only 6 menu options and within each one there is up to 6 choices.  Great ones that we found actually worked included the face chaser (useful for filming moving objects coming towards you!) and the noise reduction (reduced the wind muffles).  The camera is on as soon as you open the side wing with the view - there is no longer a viewer for the eye (thank goodness).<br /><br />Works great with good lighting - natural and artificial.  But does not work too well with dimly lit rooms.  We noticed that it really picks up the sound real well so try not to talk as you are filming as we found we ended up being more focused on that than watching the movie.  The down side on this camera was that you needed to buy a memory card and a big one at that as there is no hard drive with this camcorder; what is available only allows no more than 5 minutes of movies.<br /><br />The camera is okay, not  great as you can get better pictures on a stand alone camera.  There is flash light, which some camcorders do not have. More useful as a camcorder than a camera - so a tad expense for just a camcorder without a hard drive.",

The female connection mated perfectly with the Monster cable. Note that that cable is relatively high end with beefy plugs, so I did not expect problems with this adapter and have not experienced any.<br /><br />Since my instrument is a keyboard there is practically zero movement or opportunities for the connections to jiggle. In addition to no issues or complaints about the female end, I am as happy with the male plug, which has firmly mated with a few amps and a PA.<br /><br />If there is any issue, it's the fact that this adapter adds a lot of bulk to the end into which you plug a cable. On my keyboard it does protrude, especially with the cable I cited above. But the sound quality is noise free with my arrangement, and as I said, the connections at each end are firm and solid.<br /><br />It may just come down to the quality of cable that you intend to use with this adapter.

I wanted something with the USB ports on the top so I could easily reach them, as well as keep the cord length closer to me. This power “strip” has met that need and has certainly come in handy.<br /><br />Instead of attaching it permanently to the wall or nightstand with screws, I used Command tape for a more temporary solution. Two Command strips have held it up with no problem. It has never fallen off, even when I plug items in and out.<br /><br />I have my google home hub plugged into one of the sockets. I also have my Bose sleep bud charging case and iPhone charging stand plugged in. All things I want close to me when I’m in or on the bed.<br /><br />Recently my eye doctor said I should be using warm compresses on my eyes, so I bought an eye mask with a USB cable. I leave the USB cord plugged in and just attach the other end to my eye mask when I’m using it. So convenient and really speeds up the process. When I’m done, I disconnect the cord from the mask and tuck the cord back behind my night stand. So easy to pull out and tuck back away.<br /><br />Sometimes I need to plug in a heating pad and this is the only convenient place to plug it in while I use it from the bed. Since I don’t use the heating pad all the time, it’s easy enough to just plug it in when I need it.<br /><br />I like that it’s low-profile enough to allow my nightstand to stay somewhat close to the wall.

I have worked with hot tungsten lamps for high output and smaller LEDs for lightweight smaller setups, but LED lights that can compete with the output of Tungstens are pricey.<br />That being said, this is a FANTASTIC light. It has high output yet has the pros of LED panels such as lower power consumption and heat, as well as being dimmable and color adjustable from the panel or remote control. I had the opportunity to use this for a job yesterday setting up an interview in an office setting. My tungsten bulbs would have been too bright and need gels to match the rest of the office. My other smaller LEDs would have cast smaller spots and we all know a larger light source casts a more pleasing glow. It seemed effortless to get the amount of light we needed in a short time.<br />HOWEVER, I did find that the mounting point was a little bit difficult to use. There are two bolts to secure it to the stand, and both need to be loosened to mount it properly. It took me a few attempts to get it on the stand, one side felt like I was screwing the bolt the wrong direction most of the time. Meanwhile, the light is large and kept wobbling during this overly complicated procedure. It didn't feel like a premium product during that, which I found odd considering the price point. I have lights that cost about half of this one that felt more premium during mounting. But, that being said, once the lights are up it works a treat!<br />So, a solid 4 stars from me. Almost 5 if the mounting were easier or the price lower to make up for that. But as a light, it does what it should do and well.",

It has surge protection, too, so that your electronics stay safe.<br /><br />What sets this power strip apart, however, is its high tech personality. It can be controlled remotely using the Kasa app and you can see exactly how much power each item is using, then shut off individual outlets if you like, all from the app! And if you have Google Assistant, Alexa, or Microsoft Cortana, you can use voice commands to control the outlets. That means being able to turn on and off, say, a light that is plugged into the strip with a simple utterance.  It’s a geek’s power strip dream come true. I plan to use it on my holiday lights when the season comes around- it will be much easier then climbing behind the tree to manually turn the lights on and off.<br /><br />Kasa Smart Wifi Power Strip is a heavy- duty power strip that seems like it was made to last. The plug on the strip does require a three prong outlet to plug it in, so make sure you can accommodate before you buy. It has all of the things you would want in an app controlled, voice activated power strip and it receives my highest recommendation.",

            "question": "title: No Setup Required - It Just Works\ntext: I recently purchased a new [Windows] laptop that has a Type C connector, and I selected this unit to get more USB ports as well as the card reader. So far it has worked out well for me and it seems to work as designed, and with no tweaks or software installation required.<br /><br />This little unit is small and it easily fits in a shirt pocket though the cord does impact the way it fits in said pocket. It’s a little bigger than a comb but smaller than a candy bar.  It feels solid and well-made and so far has shown no signs of fatigue or weakness.<br /><br />I plugged it in and the fit was very snug so I had to work with it to get it plugged in properly. That’s actually a positive – it should not come unplugged unexpectedly when I move my laptop or plug something else into it, a problem I have had on occasion with MicroUSB devices.<br /><br />Windows recognized it immediately and it didn’t seem to need any extra device drivers or anything to make it work. It picked up the Ethernet interface as well as the USB hub, and that’s really all I would expect before plugging in anything else. The card reader works and I was able to read images off of the card I use in my camera through this device.<br /><br />I have not yet tried it under Linux but that’s coming shortly. I also have an Android tablet with a Type C port with which I will try this device as well.<br /><br />I have not yet tried the HDMI adapter. I have a use for it as my laptop actually does not have an HDMI port on-board and I’d like to attach it to my television to stream video.<br /><br />Would I add anything? I would have liked to see an integrated wireless adapter or a Bluetooth receiver built in, though I have those built in to my system and adding those to this unit would drive up the cost a bit. I would probably make the unit slightly larger too.<br /><br />So far, this device has been solid for me. It works right out of the box without any setup required – plug it in and you’re ready to go.",

            "question": "title: Solid, Well Made and Very Smooth\ntext: Fishing is one of the activities I have loved ever since I was very young and able to hold a fishing rod. Though I have used several types of fishing reels my personal preference is spinning reels. There are a number of reputable brands available and I have tried several - Lew’s, Quantum, Daiwa, Mitchell’s, Shakespeare and more. Until recently I was unfamiliar with KastKing as a brand and had no experience with their fishing tackle, and in a short time I have come to realize I have been missing something important. I received a Triton 3000 spinning reel for test and evaluation and have been thoroughly pleased with it.<br /><br />This reel has some heft to it, very solid and tight. It’s more substantial than many reels I have used but it’s also not the largest or heaviest either. In terms of size and weight, it falls in the middle of the pack of reels I have used for freshwater fishing and it’s a bit on the small size compared to many saltwater reels I have used. I have larger hands and the size it about right, but someone with smaller hands might find a smaller size (like the Triton 2000 or 2500) a better match. In terms of assembly, there is nothing loose or flimsy on this reel at all and there is nothing that required tightening or adjustment right out of the box (which has been a problem with some others I have used in the past). Overall, this is a solid and well-assembled reel.<br /><br />Appearance-wise, this reel is absolutely gorgeous. It is a deep shade of purple, almost black, with chrome and nickel colors on the spool, bail and handle. Appearance is not really all that important but it certainly does add to the package, and this is a reel that you won’t be embarrassed to break out in front of others. It relies on simple elegance, not bright flashy colors to make its statement.<br /><br />This reel has a good-sized spindle on it and it can hold a good amount of line. I put at least 150 yards of 8-lb test on this reel and there’s a lot of room for more. The spindle is tall, not deep.<br /><br />Ok, on to the really important stuff - how does this reel perform?<br /><br />This reel has 10 ball-bearings for forward reeling and the reel is about as smooth and quiet when retrieving as could be. Cheaper reels (cheaper meaning lower quality) tend to grind a little bit when retrieving or they make substantial amounts of noise, and some reels even have a clicker in them to mask the sound when retrieving. Some also feel hollow when retrieving, but the Triton feels solid and smooth without a hint of inferior build quality. As nice as the reeling forward is, one of the most important features in a good reel to me is a zero-reverse clutch and this reel has it down. When engaged, the reel will not reverse even a little and to me this is worth its weight in gold.<br /><br />One very real issue I have seen with some spinning reels is a poorly shaped bail that interferes with the distance when casting. If the bail is too shallow and does not allow enough clearance to allow the line to fly freely off the spindle, it can seriously impact casting distance. Fortunately, this reel has a very wide bail that has plenty of clearance around the spindle and it does not impact the cast at all. I get very good distance when casting as a result. Instead of concentrating on distance, the angler can instead concentrate on accuracy (and after years of practice I am still working on improving my accuracy).<br /><br />I tested the drag and am pleased with it as well. When tightening the drag the dial does not get more difficult to turn like on some other reels and the drag gradually makes the spindle harder and harder to turn. It is not a graduated turn, meaning it does not increase in steps so there is essentially a limitless variance in how tight the drag can be adjusted. The dial remains easy to turn all the way through the turning range until it is tightened completely, at which point it just stops.<br /><br />When reeling, either forward or backward, this reel remains balanced and does not wobble much at all. It is hard to notice wobble when the reel is attached to a rod so I tried something when I had not yet attached the reel to a rod. Holding the reel in one hand by the assembly and giving the handle a good spin, I was able to feel the reel gyrating very slightly but not appreciably. I tried the same with another high-quality reel and it was similar. This is not the case with cheaper reels which may or may not balance.<br /><br />I love the fact that the reel is mounted on an arm long enough to prevent the bail from whacking me on the knuckles when I retrieve. A reel mounted too close to the rod due to a short arm can have this unpleasant effect and I look for this problem specifically so I can avoid it. I also appreciate that the handle is far enough from the reel body to avoid hitting my hand.<br /><br />In the box with the reel is a velvety microfiber cloth bag for storage and transport when the reel is not in use. This is the only reel I have ever had that has come with such and it’s a nice touch. The bag is useful for keeping the reel clean and also for keeping supplies with it, like a small container of lubricating oil, an extra spool of line or even an extra lure or two (though this is no substitute for a tackle box).<br /><br />I am very hard-pressed to find anything to criticize about this reel. It is a solid and well-made, looks great and works like a dream. I believe I have found my new primary reel.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

I have used it for almost 2 months now exclusively and this review is based on this. I also own a Canon Rebel (which I used for real photographic ventures like special events, concerts and travel) and a Sony Cyber-shot (which I had be using for more 'quickie' picture taking as it is smaller and I can fit it in my pocket).  Although I found the picture quality far superior with the Fujifilm XF1 than the Sony, the complexity of the Fujifilm along with the high price tag, make it seem like it should be comparable to what I paid for the Rebel. To be honest, the picture quality and the flexibility/lenses of the Rebel far outweigh the Fujifilm XF1. The way I look at it, the XF1 is a really nice point and shoot. If you are looking for a quality, sleek, stylish camera which is a step above the other pocket sized cameras (especially when it comes to low-light picture capability), and you have several $100 to spend, then the investment may be worth it for you. I just think that if you are a true photographer and want to take quality pictures in the $500 price range, then go for an entry level DSLR which will give you the flexibility of interchanging lenses. I am rating this as a 4 star because, honestly, it's a great camera. It's the price, and what you get for it, that has me shaving one star off the rating.",

The quality of the e-mount sigma and sony lenses are so amazing... the Nikon manual lens pics are a little disappointing. I have yet to try with large heavy telephoto lenses but would never think about using this without a lens with its own tripod mount.

I am writing this review to give you the perspective of someone who started out with film SLR cameras in school, then got a digital 5MP camera and have used that for years and am now finally getting into Digital SLR photography.  This is a big step back into the professional circle for me, and I'm anxious to get out to the zoo or to some vacation spot in the mountains to do my professional photography once again.  I purchased this camera almost a month ago and my opinion is that it is the best camera ever made under $2,000.  This camera has everything you can need.<br /><br />I want to warn you, get the full set with the lense.  This lense sells for almost $400 and is about the best all around lense you can find.  Don't go for the cheap models.  I wrote a list about this camera that may appear on this page for you to look at, but be sure that you get the ML-L3 wireless remote (for $20, how can you go wrong) and a spare battery (2,000 pictures sounds like a lot, and I haven't needed to recharge in this month that I've had the camera, but remember that when you go on a trip you may forget to recharge and you don't want to get stuck).  Also, get a tripod (try the Slik Tripods U9000, I wrote a review of it and I find it to be the best buy around for a light-weight tripod that acts like a much heavier one) and get a carrying case (the jury is still out, I haven't found one that I like, I want one that will hold two cameras, 4 lenses, a large flash and a bunch of accessories).<br /><br />If you aren't sure if the D70s is worth the money over the D50 or the D70, it is.  The improved autofocusing system is much better than the others and the larger LCD is worth all the tea in China!  I leave the LCD protector that came with it on and have no problem seeing my pictures, even outside.  Although this is a larger camera than the D50, it isn't much of a difference and you will regret going with the cheaper camera.<br /><br />If your budget was lower, save up and buy this camera.  I bought a CoolPix 5000 a few years back and always kicked myself for not going with the D100.  Now I've gone with the best camera on the market and I'm perfectly happy.  Plus, I have the satisfaction of knowing that none of my friends can show me a better camera (unless they spent $4,000 or more on a D2X or D2H, and none of my friends can afford to do that)!!!",

I followed the manufacturer recommendation and configured both<br />fans to push air inward into the case. This case has perforated holes in the roof for ventilation and this<br />allows used air to evacuate out of the case assuming the fans are configured to blow inward which will push<br />air out those top vents.<br />The two big 140mm red LED fans I installed in the front panel are configured to pull air inward and I set them<br />to run at 100% speed (1000 RPM), they are Cougar Red LED's, very high quality fans that move a lot of air<br />silently.<br /><br />This Corsair H80i V2 has got to be the best liquid cooler available for smaller cases like mine, it has dropped<br />my system temps by 20 to 30 degrees C instantly. I am seeing system temps lower than I've ever seen them since<br />I built the system back in December 2015.<br /><br />This fridge is rocking my system. Cool is good, the cooler the better when it comes to computer systems. I have<br />Core Temp 1.0 RC6 installed and it is showing my CPU temps idling at 13C - 15C... That is chill.<br /><br />Chill is good.<br /><br />Thanks Corsair, this liquid cooler system is awesome.<br />Thanks Amazon for the excellent service and thanks UPS for being the most dependable carrier on earth.<br />My system purrs away at 15C, OMG this is awesome.",

            "question": "title: NOT FOR GAMING!!!\ntext: Initially, I liked the ergonomic design. It put much less pressure on my wrist than the Logitech trackball I've been using for many years. Unfortunately, when I started up World of Warcraft, I noticed the Kensington trackball button mapping software disabled the ability to use more than one button at once. I found the same detriment in Overwatch where multiple buttons often need to be pressed simultaneously. When I contacted the company, they sent me an email. The following is a direct quote from their email:<br />\"Thank you for contacting Kensington Technical Support.<br /><br />We would like to inform you that these trackballs are designed for basic office use and will not work on gaming applications.<br /><br />We appreciate your time and patience.\"<br /><br />To me, this came across as rather rude. This, coupled with the fact that this very mouse shows up in searches for gaming trackball mouse made me extremely disappointed and, in fact, somewhat angry. I feel Kensington needs to do any or all of the following. 1. Fix the software to make their hardware gaming inclusive. 2. Stop advertising their non-gaming devices as gaming devices (I feel this is blatant false advertising.) 3. Ask customers how they could fix issues rather than giving them a short, curt email to inform us that we, apparently, are idiots for expecting their devices to work as advertised.<br /><br />Bottom line: I do not recommend buying this product unless all you intend to use it for is emails and youtube.",

It installed somewhat easily and except for a little problem with the wireless PC card for the laptop (wouldn't be recognized at first but easily corrected) we had pretty stable use for about a year. Then we began to have connection problems. The connection would get slower and slower until internet pages would just not load, resulting in repeated \"page cannot be displayed\" errors. Powering down and restarting the router, modem and computer seemed to correct the issue. But as of this morning the router appears to have completely died. Powering down and restarting does nothing, the internet connection cannot be re-established. We can connect the desktop directly to the cable modem but for now the laptop is without connection, making for some unhappy family members here.<br /><br />As of right now I don't know if we'll be buying another Netgear router & wireless PC card. The life expectancy of Netgear products does not appear to be all that great. Looking at some of the reviews we appear to be quite lucky that we got as much time out of the router as we did. Still I'm not in the mood to be shopping for a new router every 1.5 years or less. Hopefully there is a good router out there that can last at least two years.",

I have a Crucial 500MB SSD in one of my systems and it has served me well over the years so I was interested in this SSD as a back-up option for pictures and data. It has proven to be a fine solution for my needs.<br /><br />Right up front – yes, it works with Linux right out of the box. I plugged it into my Peppermint Linux system and the kernel immediately recognized the drive and made it available. It was on me to mount the drive, but this was a simple matter and I was able to access the file system and see drive statistics. Obviously it works with Windows so I won’t go into that.<br /><br />This is a physically small device, slightly less than half the size of a cell phone (iPhone 6s is what I used for comparison). It will easily fit inside the change pocket in my jeans and can tuck just about anywhere. This is a double-edged sword. On one hand it is convenient to have something this small and easy to store, but it is also easy to misplace or even lose. If this stays in your laptop bag or briefcase it should be secure, but if you are in a habit of keeping things in your pockets instead be cautious.<br /><br />Transfer speeds are good. I have not done benchmarks on this drive but I copied thousands of pictures (average size about 8mb per file, some more and some less) and it was significantly faster than the USB drive I have been using for a while and faster than many of the thumb drives I have been using for backups. I have no complaints.<br /><br />This is a small and fast drive that just works.

The construction is as well, and you actually can turn it inside out to change the color scheme.<br /><br />Here is the 'but': this case literally fits the Sound Blaster Roar 2 like a glove (and it is only for the Roar 2 model.) The stretching and pulling required is a bit onerous. I thought it would be a learning curve issue, but each time I use this bag it is as difficult as the last time. Difficult, but not impossible. On the other hand, had this been designed for an easier fit I am not sure the same level of protection would be there.<br /><br />Also note that this is strictly for transporting the Roar 2. Once it is inserted in this case you cannot access controls. I kind of like that because I do carry my Roar 2 around and appreciate the fact that this will keep it from getting dinged.<br /><br />One final thing: the top cover does not completely close. There is a gap and there is no zipper. That is why you can turn this inside out.<br /><br />Bottom line: this provides excellent protection and is well made. On the other hand, there are challenges as I noted above and you will need to weight those into a purchase decision. I do use mine a lot and have a love/hate relationship with it.",

My kids are not allowed cell phones in school, but they are allowed music players- however most players that aren't smart devices are really janky with buggy/slow UIs and lots of impairments (I tried encoding a video for one and it wouldn't work unless I used a very archaic codec that required a suspicious Chinese desktop app). This, however, actually runs a stripped down version of Android under the hood. This is a GOOD thing! The UI is very polished and smooth thanks to open source mature OS, and features like video playback are much more robust with a wider variety of formats supported and compatible as a result as well!<br />The hardware is smooth and the menus are intuitive thanks to being familiar with the Android OS already. It's a very cute device!<br />So why only 3 stars? Well, the listing claims it has a web browser and FM radio. Both of those things are missing on this model. The truth is, I don't need my kids to have that anyway, but it feels weird that the listing advertises features which aren't there. I think I may have gotten a different model than the one advertised.<br />I considered side-loading a browser apk since it DOES run android, but the truth is this isn't designed for that sort of use and wouldn't make a difference for the purpose of this review. I'd imagine that there are a lot of possible hacks and modifications possible thanks to the operating system inside if someone wanted to tinker.",

            "question": "title: works mostly as intended, inc 4 aa batt, 2 cords (car and home), details in review\ntext: This charger works. It comes down to preference in style, and perhaps the going price at the time you are shopping around.<br /><br />Upon arrival, I immediately unpacked this ACDelco battery charger. It comes with 4 AA batteries, and since I didn't see anything on the package about them being precharged, I went ahead and plugged them into my truck adapter. I was curious how well it would do in my truck (with the included car adapter) and since I knew I was running an errand that would take no more than two hours, I figured it was a good time to try it out.<br /><br />I plugged them in at 2:10 pm, and saw that the batteries were charging as indicated by the red light. When I got back into my truck (I remembered to look!), the time was 3:05, and the battery indicator light was green, telling me that the batteries were fully charged. So this 55 minute charge time (likely less, since I wasn't in the truck whole time) tells me that it charged faster than anticipated, or the batteries had a little bit of charge on them to begin with, which is more apt the case--which is nice when they can be used right out of the package. Either way, it clearly charges and works fine.<br /><br />(edit to add..) I see in the lower product description that the batteries come charged. Mine weren't fully charged, but I assume half charge (or more),  and my charge time just topped them off. So to test this product further, I grabbed a set of drained rechargeable batteries from another brand that I hadn't gotten around to re-charging yet. I mean, I used them but drained them. I hadn't charged them again yet because I don't care for the charger it came with, so I just keep putting it off. I LIKE THIS CHARGING UNIT, and I will explain after details..<br /><br />DETAILS!<br />--This charger charges AA and AAA batteries. It comes with 4 AA batteries and two styles of cords 110-volt  wall adapter and 12-volt car adapter<br /><br />-- The cord measurement for each is as follows:<br />74\" wall charger cord<br />41\" car adapter cord<br /><br />--Charging Time Per Battery Capacity:<br />AA 1400mAh - 1800mAh: 1.5 - 2 hours<br />AA 1800mAh - 2300mAh: 2-2.5 hours<br />AAA 600mAh - 750mAh: 1.5 - 2 hours<br />AAA 750mAh - 1000mAh: 2-2.5 hours<br /><br />--So, on the face of the charger on the left hand side, there are two indicator lights: one that glows red as the batteries charge, and one that glows green when charged and ready for use. Easy peasy.<br /><br />--On the right hand side, there is a switch. It is to be set to either 2 batteries, or 4 batteries (+2, +4). Among the rebels among us, I have no idea what happens if we tried charging three batteries! :O<br /><br />--Within the battery placement area, the slots are numbered. 1 through 4.  I wish there were more clarification on this on the product page because I can no longer find the directions it came with. I am thinking that if just two batteries are being used, and they were placed in #1, #2 slots (or #3,#4) AND the indicator switched was in place for 2 batteries, does the charging juice primarily go to those spot (so as to keep with the quick charge ability)?. I think if just two batteries are being charged, then they go in the center, in the #1 and #2 spots-- so that's my plan going forward. I imagine this information is in the little pamphlet that came with the package. I'll be back if I find it and learn anything.<br /><br />--The charging batteries at no point has gotten too warm my Energizer one gets pretty warm).<br /><br />MY THOUGHTS:<br />--I LOVE that it has the TWO charging cords, with LONG cords. First, I like that it even has a cord, period. I have the Energiizer one that is just plugged into the wall. It seems like it would take up less space, but it doesn't. I find it harder to use as I need perfect clearance to plug that thing in. With this, I just need to find an outlet, then I can have it placed further away, making it easier to see and access. With the addition of the car charger, it just adds another option. Nice for camping (flashlights, radio, etc), or if you still use non cellphone cameras that eat batteries like crazy (this is what originally got me into rechargeable batteries almost 20 years ago, the digital cameras- ugh, I'm old). I sometimes bring a speaker with me for use with smartphone. It takes AA batteries. If I think to actually carry this unit around with me, I can charge my speaker batteries on the go if need be. But I think I will use this primarily in my home. I go through batteries with use of a couple of lighted mirrors. I have one that takes 4AAA and one that takes 4AA. The lights are bright, and I tend to go through batteries- so I make sure to have rechargeables on hand. As mentioned before, I like this unit because it is easier for me to find a place to put it to plug in AND have resting nearby. I had been in need of recharging a set of batteries and just hadn't gotten around to it because I don't care for the inconvenient (to me) charging unit of the other one. It works great, but I just found I prefer to have a cord. This has a cord.<br /><br />PICTURES include another brand of (depleted) rechargeable AA battery (2000mah) with start time of being placed in charging unit. Product info says AA batteries between 1800mah and 2300mah will take 2-2.5 hours to charge. I put in the batteries at 11:42 am, and at 2:18 pm they were still charging. This would be just over 2.5 hours. I got up to take my dogs outside, and when I came back an hour later, the batteries were fully charged. So, I would plan on anywhere between 2.5-3.5 for a full charge on a depleted set of batteries (from another brand). Since I have yet to fully deplete the ACDelco batteries, I can't test those out until I do.<br /><br />In summation.. I find nothing wrong with it, it works mostly intended.. If I figure anything else out as I continue to use these, I will be back to update.",

            "question": "title: Turn Your iPhone Into a Natural Point-and-Shoot Camera\ntext: The cameras built into smart phones are getting more and more capable and they have impacted sales of point-and-shoot cameras significantly. I still prefer using a dedicated camera instead of using my phone, and part of the reason is that using my phone doesn't feel the least bit like using a camera. This case changes that and converts your iPhone 6/6s into a camera that actually looks and feels like a dedicated camera in your hands. This is not just a cheap plastic shell with a lens port on it; it actually provides some good protection for the phone.<br /><br />I will start with the shell case itself. The case is a hard plastic shell, providing back and bumper protection for the phone. It snaps over the phone and holds well. It is not so tight that it is near impossible to remove, nor is it so loose that it runs a risk of letting the phone slip. Overall, it is snug and holds well. The shell itself is a hard, semi-rigid plastic that has a small amount of flex but very little. The bumper guard is a softer material though still quite stiff and it has added material at the corners to give it some extra shock absorption. This is better than the majority of shell cases I have seen and used, and on the shell itself this is a good case.<br /><br />In the package is everything you need to turn your phone into a point-and-shoot camera: the shell case itself, two grip bases (one hard plastic, one wood), a carry strap, a lanyard, a lens kit and a thumb rest for when you are holding the phone. There is even a small screwdriver so you can change the grips. It requires no other equipment or tools.<br /><br />I did not understand the purpose of the grips right away, until I removed the base plate from the shell and attached one. It made sense then – the case actually looks and feels like a camera, with a natural groove for your middle finger when holding the phone like a dedicated camera. I of course prefer the wood one, but the black plastic one better matches the shell.<br /><br />I also was puzzled by the thumb rest (wasn't even sure what it was) until I attached it to the case and held it up. My thumb rested on it naturally and it was actually a little more comfortable than my regular camera.<br /><br />The case comes with a small lens kit which is made up of a wide angle lens and a macro lens for close-up shots. I experimented with the lenses and took a picture of the field behind my house after a recent snowstorm and it definitely captured a wider view than without the lens in place. I then removed the wide angle lens and used the macro lens to take a picture of a fiber on a blanket, and it did a better job than my dedicated camera with a close-up lens. I have attached both of these pictures with my review.<br /><br />The one thing this kit does not include is a screen protector. A lot of cases do not have screen protectors and you have to buy them separately anymore. I would suggest using a tempered glass screen protector to get the best possible protection to go along with this case.<br /><br />This case is enough to make me seriously think about using my phone's camera a lot more. It makes the phone feel like a dedicated camera, it has some thoughtful features and it provides very good bumper, corner and back protection for the phone. Also available for this case are separate add-on lenses like telephoto and fisheye lenses so you can expand the capabilities even more. If you have an iPhone 6/6s, consider getting this case before you buy a separate camera.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

            "question": "title: No bubbles BUT lost sensitivity\ntext: I purchased this protector due to the overwhelming positive reports from other verified buyers. I do not like my cell phone's screen being unprotected and now with my first Kindle I feel the same way. The HDX screen is gorgeous and I want a way to keep it as such. This screen protector seemed the answer to my predicament.<br /><br />This protector is, indeed, extremely simple to 'install'. It takes more time to remove it from its packaging and throw the trash away afterwards than it does to apply the protector itself. Simply line up the cutouts on the protector film with the camera and flash at the top and center of your Kindle and you are done. I found it helpful to guide the film into place by kind of rolling the sides down, guiding them to ensure proper placement. Then just apply a little pressure (basically, run your hand around the edges) to activate the adhesive.<br /><br />Only the outer black margin of the protector has adhesive to stick it to the border and outer edges of your Kindle, thus leaving the clear center which covers your Kindle's screen loose, or non-sticky. This manufacturing and design approach has both pros and one con I have noticed so far.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />It allows for lightning fast and super easy installation.<br /><br />Because of the solid black border, you can accidentally touch the sticky side while installing and lining it up without any fingerprints showing through as with a normal screen protector. This was a bonus to me as these things are always so difficult to install without this happening.<br /><br />The clear center portion that covers the screen is completely 100% bubble free.<br /><br />Due to some micro hairs/fibers being on the screen despite having wiped it down prior to installing the protector, I learned that I could remove the protector (lifted up one corner and peeled it halfway back to do a quick swipe with the MF cloth again) and it would re-adhere to the Kindle's surface just as well as it did the first time.<br /><br />The company claims that, if it should lose its stickiness, the protector can be rinsed/washed and used again. I have yet to need to go this far so I cannot comment on the credit-worthiness of this claim, however from my experiences so far, I can see the possibility of this claim holding up.<br /><br />I have not noticed any blurring or the rainbow affect the company mentions on its packaging. The screen is crystal clear and appears to not even have a screen protector on it.<br /><br />Con:<br /><br />Since the clear center portion does not adhere to the screen, it is allowed to float just above the screen thus reducing the screen sensitivity and requiring more force from either your fingertip or your stylus.<br /><br />After using my Kindle for a few hours after installation of this screen protector, I have come to the above conclusions. As bad as the con is for me and my preferences, I will leave it on for a few days to give myself a little more time and to see if anything changes. This screen protector ranks very high on my list of desirable protectors (I even searched to see if they make a version for my Droid cell phone) so I am really hoping that the sensitivity issue works itself out soon.",

I can use it for about 10 hours or so without charging.  I just use it when I'm walking my dog. The music quality is ok for my purposes.  I dropped it once, the screen cracked a little, but it still works.  It'll play my music on my sd card fine.  What is very annoying is that I can't get the screen lock to work consistently.  When I'm playing music it will sometimes just revert to radio.  I can't figure out why.  I'm going to upgrade a little to a touch model.",

I needed an adapter, so I searched Amazon for a 2 pack, and these even say compatible with Raspberry Pi in the title / description.<br />I can assure you THEY ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE RASPBERRY PI. As far as I know, the Pi Zero is the only board that uses this sort of HDMI plug (the others use full sized HDMI), and the angle of this adapter makes it IMPOSSIBLE to connect the DC power input at the same time.  You can clearly see in the attached image, the HDMI cable blocks access to the input. If it was angled the other direction, it would work fine but in its current design, it DOES NOT work with any Pi board that I'm aware of.<br />It does work as an adapter for different hardware - my laptop for example has mini HDMI and my cameras use micro. So maybe I'll keep them around for that, but I'm only giving it 2 stars because I bought it based on the claim it would work for a specific product mentioned in the description, and it most certainly does not.",

At first I was happy with it - the sound quality is quite good, it seemed pretty easy to set up, and I was able to find my favorite NPR station streams as well as connect to my Pandora stations. But after the first two weeks or so, I started having problems with connectivity.<br /><br />- I'd come home from work and the thing would be on, not playing, with \"error connecting to network\" or some similar message flashing on the screen. The best way to solve this seemed to be to turn it off, then turn it back on, and then it would work (for a while).<br /><br />- While listening, it frequently stops playing in the middle of a song. Then the display says either \"Buffering\" for a few minutes, or more frequently, will actually say \"Connecting\" for up to five minutes at a time! This happens, on average, every 4-6 minutes. The thing is, I have a wireless router upstairs on the same floor as the radio (Apple Time Capsule) and the wireless signal is quite strong. The other devices that connect to this router never have a problem with connectivity - devices that include a Roku box, a Chumby, my iPhone, my HP netbook, my Macbook, etc.<br /><br />The problem with losing connectivity started infrequently but got worse and worse over the past two weeks or so, to the point where I can't really listen to music on it at all anymore.

Setting up features on the watch is a bit complicated.  I never did figure out how to set time and date directly on the watch.  There is an application that you can use to make settings and I had to load that application to my cell phone and when I started using the application, the time and day got set automatically.  I still haven't figured out some of the features of the watch, as they are not obvious.  I got it because it monitors blood pressure and heart rate.  Those functions work well so it serves my purpose.  This is my first smart watch, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I assume there may be better smart watches that are easier to figure out.  Once I learn how to fully use it, I may like it a lot better.  I just think the user interface could have been better and you shouldn't need a cell phone application to do basic time and day settings.  Perhaps you don't, but there is no obvious way to do it directly on the watch.  The free cell phone application that you have to install from the internet also doesn't seem that straightforward to use and I struggled a little with it also.

I actually had a need for one of these because I wanted to run an audio signal out of my Yamaha receiver to an older analog reel-to-reel recorder. The receiver had a toslink out, and the recorder had RCA in. This box was the perfect DAC.<br /><br />My signals were noise free, but understand that I was not running the analog cable more than a meter. So in that respect I did not have an adequate test of noise characteristics for longer cable runs. Moreover, I did not really use the volume feature. I set it mid way and used controls on the recorder for volume level. However, for my needs this worked perfectly.<br /><br />The instructions are a little weak, but anyone who knows what a DAC is should be able to connect and use this without them. The power supply is a standard 5V DC at 1 Amp with a center positive connector. I ran it for an extended length of time and it did not overheat (I have learned from experience to test power supplies because of occasional failures and issues.)<br /><br />Overall, this is a reasonably priced DAC that I found to be easy to use.

Many of the changes have been consumer driven while some have been manufacturer driven.<br /><br />Consumers have been wanting a reliable outdoor motion sensor for a long time.  The design of this motion detector is the most compact and resilient, where it can hold up under covered outdoor conditions.  I have had this set up on my covered front porch for the last several weeks without any issue.<br /><br />While the Amazon listing reads that it detects temperature, luminosity and motion thus far I’ve only been able to get my unit to read luminosity and motion - temperature is not showing whatsoever.<br /><br />I was able to pair the unit with my SmartThings 3rd Generation Hub immediately with no problems.  I opened the original app and went to add a device, as soon as I pulled the plastic battery protector the detector was recognized.<br /><br />In regards to operating, other than not showing temperature, it is working flawlessly.  I have used it as a trigger to turn on my front porch light from dusk till dawn.  It easily detects motion from appropriately 20-25 feet away.<br /><br />I read that there was a better custom handler for this device that could be added to SmartThings but I was unable to locate it.

The only laptops I possess range around thirteen inches, as I find carrying anything heavier than that is far too large to be considered portable.<br /><br />This briefcase has it all. There are pockets galore; at times I feel there are too many as I keep unzipping the wrong pocket or can't remember in which pocket I put something, so I wish the tags would've been different somehow. Maybe have some lanyards on some or another.<br /><br />But inside the pockets you get even more pockets and sashes to separate compartments. The material is sturdy and has held up just fine in this insane Chicago spring weather. We've had temperatures ranging from 40-80 in just two weeks, as well as rainy and dry weathers. Chicago, I tell ya!<br />My 2010 13&#34; MBP fits fine in the main laptop sleeve without sliding around much, and I'm not able to feel much wait on my shoulder from carrying it around all day, along with a couple of books, a Hobonichi planner, and my pencil case.<br /><br />The main flaw I will say this has is the shoulder strap. It's not easily adjustable, and I still haven't fully figured it out. There is a buckle in the middle on either side--one static, and the other adjustable. But the adjustable buckle doesn't allow the strap easy give, and so I can't for the life of me get it to a comfortable length.<br />The removable strap is sturdy otherwise.<br /><br />The other issue is the clasp holding the two handles together. It's not long enough, so instead of closing it with one hand I'm having to use both hands to squeeze the handles together before being able to snap the button together.<br /><br />All in all, it's a great briefcase usable even with 13&#34; laptops, but the shoulder strap and the handle clasp need better, user-friendly improvements.",

            "question": "title: A Few Wipes and the Dirt is GONE! Amazing!\ntext: Well, it finally happened. Thanks to 'having some birthdays '(my optometrist's polite way of saying  I'm getting older), two months ago I officially joined millions all over the world and became a wearer of eye glasses!  First time ever for me.  I was shocked how quickly the lenses get dirty!  The first time I went to clean them I was about to use a wet paper towel on them when my husband walked into the room, saw what I was doing and screamed, \"NO!!!\" before grabbing the towel out of my hand.  lol.  (My poor heart...scared the daylights out of me!)  I then had to listen to a lecture about what to use to clean my glasses, along with a demonstration showing me how to clean them! lolol.  He gets a box of eye glass wipes at the store for $5. and they do work well. But they left kind of a sticky residue on my fingers that I didn't care for. I did a quick check online and learned microfiber cloths do a fantastic job of cleaning glasses and do so without the use of glass cleaner (liquid) or water. I immediately ordered Fiber Promot microfiber cloths and was (still am) amazed and impressed how well they clean my glasses!  And how easy are they to use? Simply wipe the lenses a few times and PRESTO! Clean glasses! That's it. That's all it takes to wipe the dirt away!  But I didn't stop with my glasses....I then wiped down the TVs, my laptop, my Kindle and my cell phone all with the same fabulous results as my glasses!  These cloths do an amazing job and best of all, they do not scratch items they are used on!  I got the 6x7 cloth size (6 cloths included) and they're the perfect size to clean everything I listed above. I put one in my purse as well. They work great, do not cause damage and leave no sticky residue as the other wipes I previously used did.  And they're cheap! Incredibly cheap! You'd think something that works as well as these cloths work and require next to no work to use them would cost  far more than these cost!  These are incredible and do a fantastic job. There is even a 1 year money back guarantee on them, though I doubt the company gets many returns because these are fabulous!  If you wear glasses, you're going to want these cloths. And don't forget, they clean other items as well!",

            "question": "title: Good tablet but not for everyone\ntext: I will preface this review by stating that I am not a graphic artist and I did not buy this tablet for graphic work. I use tablets as an alternative to keyboards and mice as I find them more comfortable.<br /><br />I am relatively new to working with tablets but I have quickly become very dependent on my Intuos4. I like being able to write instead of type, which is in many ways easier on my hands. When I saw the Bamboo Fun [Pen and Touch], I had to try it. What better way to work with the computer than to use a touch pad and still write like I am holding a pen and writing on paper? I researched it out, watched any demo I could find and made the decision to commit. Though it's a fine tablet and it works as advertised, it does not suit my needs. There are some things I would change with the design, too, which I will discuss below.<br /><br />The Bamboo Fun [Pen and Touch] is a pleasant-looking device, very thin and taking up a modest amount of desk space. It follows a design look-and-feel of Apple devices, very smooth, simplistic and masking its real potential.<br /><br />My first observation - the USB cable is a permanently attached cord, which is a design decision that really should be changed. If the cable fails, the tablet fails. Most USB devices have a detachable cable, so I am not sure why Wacom elected to make this device with a permanent cable. I suspect (rather, I hope) that this will change down the road on future versions, but for now it is what it is.<br /><br />The install did not go well, and I realize I am the exception to the rule. Because I had previously attached and installed drivers for the Intuos4, I uninstalled the drivers before trying to attach the Bamboo. The uninstall did not work as I expected, as Windows loaded up drivers without hitting the installation media when I plugged it in. As a result, the touch portion of the pad allowed me to move the cursor but tapping and dragging did not work at all. I ended up uninstalling and reinstalling the tablet, and on the second attempt it installed properly. The tutorial loaded and I was able to practice some of the new hand gestures available to me.<br /><br />Most intriguing of the features available is the ability to use two fingers on the pad simultaneously to zoom in and out and to rotate images, but there is a catch - it is application-dependent and does not work the same with different applications. Also, at one point I tried to scroll and I got a zoom action instead.<br /><br />Digging deeper, I discovered that the device simply maps the hand gestures to the same events that would be associated with a good mouse and in fact the documentation suggests making sure the actions that would be associated with mice should be mapped the same as if using a mouse instead of the tablet. In a nutshell, this tablet is a glorified laptop touchpad with scroll wheel events mapped in. Properly mapped, this tablet performs very well.<br /><br />As I worked with the touch portion of the Bamboo, I had some trouble with the two-finger gestures. I closed a lot of Windows inadvertently and the events were not mapped uniformly (as mentioned above). However, the most frustration came because of the way I rest my hands on the desk (which affects the way I rest my hands on the tablet). I found I frequently would have more than two fingers on the tablet simultaneously just because of the way I rest my hands, and as a result I was working against myself with this tablet. Also, because I would hold the pen while trying to use the touch features, the pen would disable touch and I would get nothing.<br /><br />Using the pen with this tablet worked as expected. It has 1024 pressure levels, which is fine for the average user like me or someone who is a little more creative. Wacom offers more sensitive tablets with more pressure sensitivity which is more in line with professional artists' needs. That said, I can see the difference when doodling with the pressure levels. Some upgrading from a simpler tablet will be thrilled; someone downgrading from a more sensitive tablet will be unhappy.<br /><br />I uninstalled the Bamboo and went back to the Intuos. Most of the problems I had with the Bamboo are personal preference, though some of the issues are design related.<br /><br />This really is a good tablet and I can recommend it to people who want to completely get rid of mice and other pointing devices. There are a lot of good features in this tablet and it works as advertised. Unfortunately in my case, it did not suit my needs.",

I have some older things that rely on standard USB-A charging cables, so I needed one of these to supplement the available ports.

It can also plug into your phone or tablet to give you a standard USB host port, but just understand you will be limited to the older (but still very good) USB 2.0 standard. That's fine for most things, but if you're copying files from USB storage to your Macbook's thunderbolt port, you might want to get at least a USB3 speed adapter.",

You need to wrap the long wire, and tape it, then keep in your gym shorts while exercising.  After that, they work well.  They do not get smelly or loose quality if worn frequently in the gym.  And, the light weight design works well with any exercise.  As for use as a studio headphone, maybe not so great.  They keep out noise, but due to their design, do not have enough padding to keep out high level noise.  Again, at the gym, that is good, so your buddy can get your attention.<br /><br />My rating would be a two star if used by somebody serious in the music industry.

Installing it consisted of attaching the device directly to the printer's parallel interface, connecting an Ethernet cable to the RJ-45 port on the other side of the print server, running the CD ROM installation and being able to immediately print to a shared printer.<br />One of the things I most like is the installation and configuration utility that ships with this device.  You get an administration program (you can also access and administer the print server through a browser or through a telnet session), and an \"add printer\" wizard that makes configuring other computers on your network easy.  In fact, the \"add printer\" wizard is a quantum improvement over D-Link's earlier Pocket Print Server products - I own an older model and set-up and configuration was somewhat confusing, which is no longer the case with their newer software.  I also link the small power supply, which takes up little space in a power strip or on an UPS.<br />Overall, this is a high quality product that has a plethora of features (it supports Windows networking, AppleTalk and TCP/IP, and it can be managed via browser of by using TCP/IP telnet), and can be installed and configured by a novice.",

I personally think this and the 2-channel model that Alesis offers are game changers, mainly because the features and reliability are on par with the PreSonus competing products, and the price point is significantly less. In other words, bang for your buck.<br /><br />Before rushing out and getting one of these (or its larger sibling - or even the competing PreSonus), make sure you need it. I have found that on a reasonably decent PA system this product makes a dramatic difference with the older technology mics like [[ASIN:B000CZ0R3S Shure SM57 Microphone]] and the [[ASIN:B000CZ0R42 Shure SM58-LC Cardioid Vocal Microphone without Cable]], or the lower end SM58 clones that are bundled with PA systems and otherwise flood the market (the [[ASIN:B00009W40D NADY SP-4C Dynamic Microphone]] comes to mind). On the other hand, not only have I found that these tube pre-amps not very useful with more modern design microphones like the [[ASIN:B002SQJL9U Blue Microphones enCORE 100 Studio-Grade Dynamic Performance Microphone]], the [[ASIN:B00006I5R7 Sennheiser E835 Dynamic Cardioid Microphone]], etc. In fact, with the more modern designed microphones, which run much hotter in signal, a pre-amp in a live PA needs to have the gain turned to the lowest level in many cases or feedback becomes a problem.<br /><br />If you do need one of these devices, I recommend - unless your budget is severely limited - that you consider the [[ASIN:B005NIVLX4 Alesis Mic Tube Duo Stereo Tube Microphone Preamplifier]] instead. The reason is for a slight increase in price you get an extra channel that you may not need now, but may find to be a requirement in the future.",

If they had made this protector even 3mm wider, this would not have been an issue since any lack of clarity you couldn't 'work out' of the protector with your fingers wouldn't effect the area of the screen that you actually view, just the bezel.

I am the main prepper in the household, but even my husband bought one at random recently. He showed me his, then I showed him mine.  Then I got this one to add to the collection. Different brands, all very similar. The one feature that STANDS OUT to me on this FORTECLEAR is that there is a light that indicates that it is being charged. I can see it glow brighter when using the hand crank, as well as when I have it sitting in a ray of sunshine. If in the sun with the light glowing, once I cover the solar panel with my hand, the indicator turns off. Really nice to see that working. Like others, there is also an indicator that shows about what percent of power is has (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) which will light up when it is being actively used. Really nice to be able to see this important info. For that I recommend this as an emergency item (or even casual use, why not?)<br /><br />Has typical features such as flashlight (low beam, high beam, and flashing), has a flip up \"reading\" light, and radio bands such as alert, WB, FM, and AM. Nice long antennae, knob tuning, knob volume control. USB port, USB C port, comes with a cord & instructions, wrist strap,  has SOS alarm- which requires pressing for a couple of seconds to activate, SO much better than another where I have accidentally triggered it by a simple short press. Scared myself. LOL.  SO LOUD.<br /><br />When looking for weather band, you may need to walk around to get a signal. I find this true of all emergency radios, or any radio with WB/NOLA option. As with most all other radios, FM comes in the best, the easiest.<br /><br />I am a big fan of having multiple options for lighting- whether it be solar, battery operated, internal battery that can be charged, etc. This has the ability to be charged, to be hand cranked, and to be solar charged. Nice to have a few options in one device. I also keep regular flashlights, rechargeable flashlights, battery powered radios, etc on hand. Multiple options for when it is needed. But this will be one I will rely on. I would get it again, and I would get this for someone else. I tend to give functional gifts, stuff that most folks dont want to buy for themselves (preps, fire extinguishers, smoke alarms, car care kits, etc), and this would be a good one to give. Really pleased that it works so well because it happens to be a few bucks more than most options out there.<br /><br />I will continue to play around with this. If I think of anything else, or experience anything else (good or bad) I will be sure to come back to update. So far so good!",

It cannot go in the opposite direction (connecting composite RCA devices to HDMI).<br /><br />For me this is a great way to add an additional HDMI port to a monitor I own that has a single HDMI and a single set of AV composite ports. I can also use this on an older TV that has HDMI and a dual set of AV composite ports. I did test this using a Blu-Ray player on the HDMI and to the TV and it worked beautifully as long as you do not set your video resolution to be higher than 1080p for Blu-Ray, but will support ancient 640x480 all the way up to 1920x1080.It also supports 480i or 480p up to the 1080p I mentioned above.  Of course, if you are using this to add HDMI to older display devices you are probably going to be limited in resolution anyway.<br /><br />Then converter itself is small, hassle-free and does not require any external power. For expanding to an additional HDMI port on a TV or monitor with a spare set of AV composite ports, or connecting HDMI devices to legacy equipment that only has AV composite input this is an inexpensive solution.",

            "question": "title: A Heftier, More \"Substantial\" Stylus\ntext: Capacitive styluses are not all alike.  Besides color, there are subtle differences in sensitivity, length, barrel size, weight, and attachment clips or lanyards.  This Targus stylus, which is 4.75\" long (exclusive of the capacitive tip) is quite a good one, in terms of sensitivity.  Screens slide with minimal pressure, and selections register with only a light touch or tap.<br /><br />Compared to other styluses that I tested, the Targus stylus is the longest, has the widest barrel, and is the heaviest.  The weight makes it tiring for me to use, but some individuals (men, perhaps?) may prefer a heftier, more \"substantial\" stylus like this one.  Because of the wider barrel, the tip is also wider, which makes it slightly less accurate for selecting small targets (e.g., links displayed in web browsers in tiny fonts).  The extra length is a plus, if you hold a stylus like a pointer (away from the tip), rather than like a pencil (close to the tip).<br /><br />This stylus has both a pocket clip and a metal attachment \"loop\" (for attaching to a lanyard or keychain).  I purchased mine at a local office supplies store.  Besides this stylus, I tested the [[ASIN:B005O2URES MiniSuit Universal Capacitive Stylus Pen]], the [[ASIN:B0008G3ID2 BoxWave Capacitive Kindle Fire Stylus]], and the [[ASIN:B004GCJEZU AmazonBasics Stylus for Touchscreen Devices]].  My favorite is the AmazonBasics Stylus, because of its 4.25 \" length, slim barrel, light weight, and excellent sensitivity.  I rate this stylus at 4 stars (\"I like it\") rather than 5 stars (\"I love it\"), because I like the AmazonBasics stylus slightly better.<br /><br />In case you're wondering, as I was, what a \"capacitive\" stylus is, it is a human interface device (e.g., a mouse) that uses \"capacitive sensing\" to measure changes of position on a touchscreen.  It works just like a human finger on a touchscreen device, and you can often get more accurate navigation using a stylus.  Wikipedia has good articles on capacitive sensing and capacitive devices.",

            "question": "title: Sleek, stylish, and incredible sound!\ntext: My first Bluetooth speaker was the Bose Soundlink; I then transitioned to a smaller, more portable Braven LUX. As an audiophile, when I was offered the opportunity to test drive the RIVA Turbo X, I jumped at it. The first thing I noticed right off the bat is the WEIGHT; the speaker clocks in at nearly 6 pounds (compared to the lightweight Braven, or the slightly heftier Soundlink). It's also designed like a sportscar, with a glossy black finish with red rubber accents covering access ports. The top contains streamlined buttons for Power, Surround, Bluetooth pairing, mute, up and down volume, and Turbo mode. There's also an iOS app that allows you to control the surround and turbo settings directly from your phone.<br /><br />I appreciated the quick start guide handily attached to the top of the speaker; it recommends that you play the speaker at 50% volume for several hours to break them in. It comes out of the box partially charged (around 40%) meaning you can start using it immediately (which I did using David Garret's new &#34;Explosive&#34; album). The sound balance is fantastic; as I live in an apartment, unfortunately I'm not able to really take advantage of the Turbo mode (which boosts to over 100dB). Pairing was a snap and I was off and running. As soon as I synched with my iPad, I was prompted to download the &#34;Ground Control&#34; app (which as previously mentioned, gives you battery life stats, volume, and the ability to turn on surround and Turbo modes).<br /><br />It also comes loaded with extras in the form of RCA cables, male-to-male audio cables, and it's also capable of charging other devices. The battery is recharged via AC (the life is around 26 hours); no USB option here. The touch buttons on top illuminate when you hold your hand over it, which is a fantastic feature in a dark room or if you're using this outside.<br /><br />The sound is fantastic with just about every genre I threw at it, from Baroque opera vocals to instrumentals to EDM.<br /><br />This is a serious investment that not only looks fantastic, but sounds absolutely fantastic...and my Bose Soundlink is going in the closet. If you're looking for maximum power with no trade in sound quality (especially at higher volume levels), the Riva TurboX is the way to go.",

My altec speakers were pretty good speakers too, and I can't tell the difference. My upgrade is simply cosmetics. This logitech set is black and sleek, looks more modern. My altec speakers were grayish, very early 2000's design.<br /><br />I like the nifty wireless controller that looks like a little echo dot, but it's smaller. So coming from speakers in the early 2000's, my first question was.. Can this function like old school speakers if I don't care for all the tech? So I simply used the 3.5mm connection method from my dell to the logitech, but there was NO SOUND. So you have to at least power up the wireless controller for the first time. Because under the controller is a button to switch from bluetooth to wired. Press the WIRE option, and you will then get audio. After this, if you remove the batteries and take away the wireless controller, the speakers will continue to work as 3.5mm connected speaker. You just have to turn on the wireless controller on the initial set-up. So this is good. My concern was what if the wireless controller is lost or damaged? If that happens, then you would like the speakers to go on like old school speakers connected simply by 3.5mm. So I'm happy to report, this will function without the wireless controller module. I'm not even sure turning on the wireless controller in the initial set-up is absolutely required. Your PC my pick-up sound the moment you plug in the 3.5mm jack. For me, I had to turn on the wireless controller during the initial set-up.<br /><br />Another thing I wondered is if I connect a bluetooth device, say my smartphone, to these speakers, then disconnect, will the speakers automatically revert back to wired? The answer is no. To connect to a bluetooth device, you have to press the bluetooth pairing button under the wireless controller, and it will stay in this mode even after you disconnect. You have to press the \"wire\" button to get back to 3.5mm.<br /><br />One more thing, the left and right speakers have 2 slots in the back to insert the stand. So you can configure it to stand vertically or horizontally. Conclusion... I love the sound, the sleek design and the technology. 5-Stars.",

It is wireless and works very well. It connected to my laptop and installed itself without any issues whatsoever. I like how it fits in my hand and it works very well. It is very light in your hand though so some may prefer a mouse with a little bit more weight, personally I like that it is light especially when you work for longer hours this will come in handy.<br /><br />The mouse looks great in my eyes and I like the design. It fits beautifully in my hand and is in that regards designed very well. It is very comfortable to use and quiet. You can also adjust the speed settings on this which is great. It only needs one AA battery which is great and has an on off button so you can preserve energy when you are not using it.",

            "question": "title: Well-Balanced System for Business and Gaming Use\ntext: The majority of Ultrabook computers on the market right now are ill-suited for the gamer, concentrating very heavily instead on the business user. With this particular Ultrabook, Dell has found a balance between the two groups and has produced a system that does well both as a business workhorse and a middle-of-the-pack gaming rig, at a very reasonable price point. I can think of a few relatively minor changes I would make to this system to make it even more attractive but that would mean increasing the cost.<br /><br />Right out of the box, this computer feels very well constructed. The lid is brushed aluminum and does not flex like that of some other systems I have used in the past and that's reassurance that the screen will face less stress from being flexed. The hinge is nice and tight too, and from what I can ascertain so far it should hold up for a very long time. The overall system has a little bit of heft to it as well, feeling quite solid. I personally prefer a system that feels rugged, even if it weighs just a little more.<br /><br />At its thickest this system is roughly an inch. This is great - it fits beautifully in my computer bag and leaves room for papers and folders with it in the same bag. This is a minor point, particularly if the user is going to leave this system on the desk all the time, but I find it to be a positive trait. Other systems I have used have been a snug fit in the bag and require a little more planning when packing for use on the go.<br /><br />When first powered on the system walks the user through the setup process, eventually landing at the Windows 8.1 Metro interface. A quick check confirmed that Windows 8.1 Update is *not* installed by default, and this actually came as a surprise. Microsoft has made it clear that the update will be required in order to get any further updates, so I would have thought it would have been part of the configuration already as this system has very recently come to market). I pulled it down from Windows Update and it installed without a hitch.<br /><br />One of the first things I did with this system was to build recovery media. Dell won big points with me on this - while most (if not all) other manufacturers seem to be going towards creating USB-based recovery images (and many rely on the built-in Windows 8 recovery media creation tool), Dell still allows the user to create DVD recovery media. I made two sets. The utility that Dell provides is just as simple and smooth as can be, was easy to find and worked without a problem. This is exactly the kind of experience most users should expect, regardless of manufacturer.<br /><br />This is an Ultrabook-class system and as such there are certain things to keep in mind. First and foremost, this system has no CD/DVD/Blu-Ray drive of any kind. Having an optical media drive on an Ultrabook is rare so this is not a shortcoming per se, but it does mean that users need to have an external DVD drive in order to work with any platters in this system. This is inconvenient but it's the norm for Ultrabooks. Also, this system has only three USB ports, a HDMI out port, an SD card reader and no VGA out (which isn't any surprise actually). Some Ultrabooks do not have an Ethernet port and rely solely on the wireless network adapter, but this one does include an Ethernet port.<br /><br />Dell makes a point to extol the virtues of their touch screen, and so far I have found the screen to be above average. The resolution is 1920x1080 which makes for very clear, crisp images but it also means that print is very small at maximum resolution. I will likely lower the resolution slightly which will make everything a little bigger and easier to see, but some people likely will especially like the ability to cram so much more on the screen. The screen is very bright, too, and my particular screen has absolutely no dead pixels. The important feature of this screen is the ability of it to receive and process touch and gesture events. It is very responsive and so far has given me no difficulties except that my fingers are a bit large and sometimes I touch something next to what I want on the screen.<br /><br />Typical notebooks and Ultrabooks available come with 8GB of RAM. This one comes with 16GB which is great for those running multiple applications simultaneously or are running virtual machines. I was a little puzzled, though, by the \"DDR3L\" type which I had not seen prior. It turns out that DDR3L is a low-voltage variant of DDR3.<br /><br />The hard drive in this system is a generous 1TB hybrid drive, which means it is partially SSD and partially traditional platter-based. The idea behind this type of drive is to put the bootable OS on the SSD portion and everything else on the platters. I see some advantage to this and the system boots up in a reasonable amount of time but I don't see this system coming to a ready state nearly as fast as systems with a straight SSD. Also, this drive is a 5400-RPM drive which is slow by today's measure. I personally would prefer to have less space and have a purely SSD in the system, but that would drive up the cost a bit.<br /><br />There are two graphics controllers in this system. One of them is the Intel HD4000 controller which is part of the Core i7 chipset. The other is an ATi Radeon R7 M265, sporting 2GB of display RAM. This second adapter is what allows this system to run more graphically intensive games, though it is not a high-end controller and struggles to render the top new titles at maximum resolution. As a test I had my teenage son load up a 1st-person shooter he likes and he was favorably impressed with the ability of the system to keep up with it. I also loaded up a drawing application with complex artistic brushes and tried to overwhelm the system. While the system lagged behind when I pushed hard enough, it kept up admirably well.<br /><br />One of the features generally pushed with Ultrabooks is battery life - lower power consumption and only necessary components should extend the run time on battery power. I have found the run time to be roughly 3 to 3.5 hours which is a little low. There are a few contributing factors to this that I think can be partially overcome. First, the system has a backlit keyboard that is on by default. This lighting can be turned off and this will help. Also, the default power scheme has the screen brightness up a little higher than expected in energy conservation settings, so lowering the screen brightness is a good option as well. However, the hard drive is a traditional platter-based drive. If replaced with a SSD instead the power consumption could be improved even more.<br /><br />Dell touts their sound system on this Ultrabook as being something special. Using just the speakers this is not obvious as the speakers are only average. However, when the system is used with headphones the difference becomes very apparent and it is clear that Dell put some thought and effort into the sound system. The default sound profile is good - very crisp highs, warm midrange and full bass, all suitable for gaming. The sound profile can be changed to another pre-defined selection by selecting a menu option on a Dell-supplied utility, making the sound system very flexible. This is a bit unusual for a system - I am used to this for individual applications. With such effort put into the sound system in this computer it is puzzling that Dell chose mediocre speakers.<br /><br />This particular system comes with facial recognition software that is supposed to make logging in easier. I did not like it one bit - the software seemed to have trouble recognizing my face and would not allow me to log in, even with the correct password. I uninstalled it when I finally got logged in.<br /><br />As I write this, this computer retails for about $1,150 (though is a hair less expensive here on Amazon). Considering the feature set, this is a very reasonable asking price. I can think of a few improvements to the system, such as better speakers and a SSD instead of a traditional hard drive but adding these in would increase the cost of manufacture and would therefore increase the end-user cost as well.<br /><br />Dell has put together a nice system that finds a good balance between business uses and gaming. There are systems better suited to gaming available but these typically come at a higher cost. It has a nice touchscreen, good sound and generous storage. The ATi graphics adapter makes the gaming experience not only possible but pleasant. Other than a few smaller point this is a solid and well-designed system that is worth a look if you want a system that can handle most functions without argument, all worth its asking price.",

I'll update and leave links to whatever he decides he needs.<br /><br />There are many different parts inside, all are labeled.

This is all fine by me, as I'm really looking for some supplemental educational materials since we have no choice currently than to home-school. I suppose if we must home-school, we can make it as fun as possible and do some projects that are more true to real life and sourcing material and information just as any adult must do to learn a new skill on their own.<br /><br />As there are a variety of components, I can easily imagine this would be great for modifications or repairs as well.

He had actually broken his previous gaming headphones and this seemed like a no-frills decent replacement for him to try.<br />The sound quality is actually quite good. Both the ear pieces and the microphone are crisp and clear, so no complaints there. However my son found it a little uncomfortable to wear compared to his larger over-the-ear style headphones before. The actual ear parts on this are smaller, which means they don't fully envelop your ears the way other ones do. On the plus side, this means it doesn't block as much external noise, which I like for him in our household (no more calling his name when he can't us!), but others may want more noise isolation. Also, the smaller ear pieces aren't as comfortable when worn as the larger ones.<br />I also didn't like that it didn't come with an adapter to break out for mic and speakers like other headsets do. I thought it would come with that as an option, as I've never gotten a PC headset that didn't offer either a splitter or TRRS combo adapter so you can use it with both a laptop that has mic/headphone combos as well as separate mic and headphone jacks commonly found on a desktop.<br />Thankfully I had an extra one lying around for him to use, so that wasn't an issue. But something to take into consideration. Others, I've got to give it at least 4 stars for working well and doing what it should. But there might be other options for the price worth considering as well if you want larger earphones or a breakout cable included.",

            "question": "title: Stand Holds iPad Securely at Many Comfortable Viewing Angles\ntext: This BEANPAD FOR iPAD is an absolutely great iPad 2 stand (and I've tested several).  First, it's nearly impossible to knock over or drop.  Second, it can be set to almost any comfortable viewing angle.  And third, it securely supports your iPad pretty much anywhere you can set it down.<br /><br />To use this stand, you insert your iPad (2 or 3) into the black, hard plastic holder.  The holder grips firmly but gently, and easily releases the iPad whenever you like.  With the iPad in the holder, the beanbag conforms to any surface (a knee, a table, a desktop, a chair arm), and makes a secure base so that the stand cannot suddenly collapse.  The black beanbag is about the size of a large cantaloupe, and is just heavy enough that it cannot be easily knocked over or knocked off a table.<br /><br />The stand's viewing angle can be adjusted to an almost limitless  number of positions.  The holder itself can be rotated so that the iPad is held in a vertical or horizontal position.  Then the actual viewing angle can be adjusted by squishing the beanbag to find the most comfortable viewing position.<br /><br />I purchased my first BEANPAD FOR iPAD from Woot! for the bargain price of $25 (including shipping).  But when my husband needed an iPad, too, I purchased a second BEANPAD FOR iPAD (this one) for him at full price, because it allows the iPad to be used comfortably just about anywhere in the house.",

Downloaded the online app. Put in a memory card. Turned on our iPads, Phones, and Apples. Presto we could see every point inside our home should our exterior camera system connected to the home security device ever fail.<br /><br />We travel 140 miles West to our 2nd home and watch inside our home, while driving whoever is not at the wheel will pull up the home-cam so we can see what is happening on our cell phones. We went to Vegas, a few months ago and hired a dog sitter to stay with our beloved pet at our home. We were able to check-in & from our hotel room, Freemont Street or the Strip and check on our home without any problems.<br /><br />Unless you are still operating in the AOL age or have so many firewalls up the smoke detectors keep going off inside your home; I can't see why the product would not work for a person needing a quick install. The type of one they control that is portable enough to move from room to room, (even a window seal).<br /><br />If you live in a valley surrounded by mountains where at best you have a fuzzy cell phone use, you may want to get the kind of cams able to be through DSL if possible. Personally, if you are using the most current technologies, keep you system updates performed and no longer have to type www after the dial tone stops screeching, can read and follow directions; then you should be able to follow the instructions and if necessary work with a customer service technician associated with this item.<br /><br />By the way, it is not just your computer that needs updates if you no longer use brick phones. If you have advanced enough to be no longer paying for minutes, but rather have plans permitting you unlimited use of services through &#34;unlimited data&#34; plans (this includes calls too,) within the lower 48 and depending how fast you can drive into and out of Mexico, you will have excellent service.",

It is compact and light enough to tote around without breaking your shoulder, and comes with accessories for playing in the car, an AC cable, and also has a rechargeable battery for wireless viewing anywhere.  It even comes with a remote (but not a pretty one)<br /><br />For adults this is a great little gadget - it never gets into a snit over bumpy roads or potholes, and with your headphones on, it can give you hours of viewing when you&#8217;d rather be alone.  The screen even swivels around for the best possible picture in cramped situations.<br /><br />For kids however, there are some things you should note:<br /><br />1. The silver finish gets scratched and dirty quickly<br /><br />2. The power is controlled by a slider button which doesn&#8217;t feel as sturdy as it should &#8211; ditto the button to open the section where the DVD goes<br /><br />3. The button to open the player is right in front where little hands can accidentally press it while in use.<br /><br />4. On the right hand side, there&#8217;s a button to choose the DVD format.  This often slides to the other side when taking it out of the case, and fools you into thinking that the player isn&#8217;t working.<br /><br />5. Our video display stopped working on Day 2, until we reset it by unplugging the player without turning it off and then plugging it in again.<br /><br />6. The control buttons on the player itself are not very user friendly, and I still have no idea what some of them do, but I haven&#8217;t needed to use them so far anyway.<br /><br />7.  You can&#8217;t play old or scratched discs, as these will damage the player.  (I don&#8217;t know about you, but most of my kid&#8217;s DVDs are scratched and battered)<br /><br />Picture quality and sound are good, as is portability. Overall, this is a very convenient DVD player for traveling or commuting, but one that requires care and attention to work properly.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, March 1, 2006",

They're the behind-the-head style that's oh-so-popular these days, but the fit is far worse than the comfortable (but breakage-prone) Logitech Wireless Headphones for iPod that I had before. These pair easily with my bluetooth-enabled Thinkpad, which is nice, and also with my phone (at the same time) so I can take calls and it will switch from the music, then switch back when my call is over. The built-in mic works surprisingly well, for a really hassle-free bluetooth experience.<br /><br />Now for the bad: I feel like these headphones were designed for kids. They're so small (I was really shocked when I opened the packaging at how small they are) that they pinch my ears hard. The headband just simply isn't big enough for a normal-sized head. Another minor thing is that they have a mind of their own when you put them down. If you sit them down with the earpieces facing up (which you invariably will when you have to take your hourly break from the pain they cause), they \"walk\" themselves off of the desk if you put them down the wrong way.",

            "question": "title: Acceptable for portable storage, will probably not cut it for PS5.\ntext: The Centon Premium SSD at 1TB is priced higher than even the WD_Black while claiming faster speeds.  Before I get into my conclusions, I need to say that I'm only testing this drive through a USB enclosure so the conditions aren't optimal, but my conclusion about this drive is in comparison to another drive that I test through the same enclosure, meaning all conditions are the same between the three drives.<br /><br />I had two other drives that I was able to performance test against this Centon drive.  The first is a [[ASIN:B09575SWX5 Pioneer NVMe]] drive at 256GB and the second is a [[ASIN:‎B08695D3VW Klevv NVMe]] drive at 512GB.  All three drives were placed inside a USB drive enclosure and connected via a Type-C cable capable of video transfer (meaning it's made for data transfer, not just charging).<br /><br />Because I'm only testing through USB 3.1, I'm not expecting to reach advertised speeds but using the relative performance between the three drives under the same conditions, I can make some conclusions.  The Pioneer drive is advertised at speeds of up to 2,100/1,600 MB/s and in my setup, I was able to reach 1,041/937 MB/s which is quite impressive.  On to the Klevv drive:  it is advertised at speeds of up to 2,050/1,650 MB/s and my results for this drive was 915/922 MB/s.  Both drives are quite affordable and for use as a fast, portable storage, they work well.<br /><br />Now, the Centon makes big claims.  It is advertised at 5,500/1,800 MB/s. That's faster than WD_Black's advertised speed of 3,600 MB/s read!  This is obviously aimed at those who are looking to upgrade a PS5 with more storage, but my results can be see in the screenshot.  Under the same conditions, it only meets the performance of the Klevv and is slower than the Pioneer.  I don't have high confidence for this actually being great for a PS5.<br /><br />In addition, just as a previous review stated:  I received this drive in an electrostatic bag inside an Amazon Prime envelope.  I was lucky that the drive was still functional when it got to me.<br /><br />Not impressed.",

Today it got to the point where I got such ridiculous highly technical instructions so I ended the chat. They are poorly qualified to provide technical support.

            "question": "title: An AMAZING Shower Speaker\ntext: This shower speaker has far exceeded my expectations, after a very thorough evaluation I can completely say this is an outstanding product - in fact, the best shower speaker I have reviewed.<br /><br />First of all, this item arrived quickly and is exactly as described.<br /><br />After following the instructions and fully charging using the USB cable, I paired it with my iPhone with no issue.<br /><br />All of the control buttons are on the front of the speaker while the charging port is on the lower side. Every opening is sealed very well and withstands the moisture of the shower without an issue.<br /><br />The sound is rich and clear. It is clear in the full range of sound from the deep bass notes to the clear high pitches.<br /><br />Calls are clear and can be received without any issue. Microphone volume is a bit low when speaking - the person calling may have some trouble hearing the person speaking in the shower.  Part of that is the ambient noise generated by the shower, which is to be expected. Most people won't make a habit of talking on the phone while showering, so I really don't see this as an issue.<br /><br />The super powerful 1800mAh internal battery will last and last. After the initial charge, I was able to use the speaker daily while in the shower and then getting ready for well over a month before recharging and probably could have gone longer.  I used the speaker not only while showering but also while getting ready.<br /><br />In conclusion, as far as listening to music or audiobooks while in the shower and getting ready this speaker is excellent. The speaker produces a rich sound quality with more than enough volume. The battery is excellent, providing plenty of power requiring less time charging and delivering more time enjoying the music.<br /><br />If you are looking for a great speaker for in your shower or other moist environments - look no further.  This is definitely a Bluetooth speaker I highly recommend.",

I've had all TG-830 to the TG-860 haven't tried the TG-870 as of yet. I wanted to try Olympus newest camera the TG-4. Big disappointment :(<br />Since day of purchase 06-2015 video stabilizer wasn't working properly, the audio when you zoom in or out muffles out and you lose audio.<br />Auto focus on photo & video is just crap...I can be in the most well lit areas and 80% of the time I have to power down and power back on and hope the auto focus adjusts accordingly.<br />When video shooting/recording the working mechanism can be heard throughout the video shoot and usually happens 75% of the time. With all this said....Mine was repaired 3 x's for these issues....<br />When the camera works it works great, but I do a lot of YouTube and all you hear is the clicking noise from the mechanism inside and camera has been since replaced and replacement one is just as bad :( 1 star folk's sad to say ;(<br />I understand there are very sensitive working parts and the audio can pic them up....but it's not OK when you make videos and you friends and fans ask? What is that clicking noise in your videos? I tried to ignore it...but it's just so loud and annoying.<br />The video stabilizer just straight up a joke in the model....I can get a old flip phone camera and get better results. Remember folk's these were all supposed to have been repaired many times.<br />On the bright side.....when the camera works it take absolutely amazing photos. But video is very weak in this model....Customer service was fair....and did replace the camera, but the replacement was just the same....as for the extended warranty those folk's were a joke.<br />I'll leave it as that cause then this review would be a book/novel. On the flip side....I see and this can possibly only be coincidence....but I feel it really is mostly with the &#34;Red&#34; model....seems the black has it's own special issues. I really tried to love this camera...but the camera is my job and this is just a no go....I'll just have to say this was a waste of $400.00 bucks I may try the TG-870 but now I'm studying up and leaning towards Canon line of cameras :(",

Don't see any big difference from my 50-mile antenna\ntext: I didn't want to review this until I'd had a chance to use it for a while.<br /><br />We cut the cord on cable a few years ago, and went to antenna and a smart tv. The antenna I was using had a 50-mile radius. This one makes claims of 180 miles.<br /><br />I placed it next to my other antenna. I have a very large tree fairly close to the bedroom window, so I do have some difficulty with reception here. We are near the STL broadcast area, so no mountains or forests in our way.<br /><br />I first tried just switching the antenna connection without a new channel scan. Everything looked exactly the same as with my old antenna. No biggie. It has a nice, long cord, which helps for placement.<br /><br />The next day, I ran a scan for new channels. I really expected to see some new channels pop up with the additional 130 mile radius. Nope. I have exactly the same channels.<br /><br />Of course, your experience could vary greatly, depending on your location, topography, big buildings, etc. But I have to say that this 180-mike-radius antenna does nothing at all different from my 50-mile-radius antenna.

Getting all the knobs to line up is a lot more difficult than you'd expect so it's easy for this to be lopsided. Crank this angle down 5-7 degrees and then you have to fight to get the other side the same 5-7 degrees. And there are three knobs per side to adjust. You push the knob in and the move it to release but it's just not precise. It's not too difficult but it can be a bit frustrating. I bought this to work or watch videos on my iPad from bed and it's great but now that it's set up I'm reluctant to collapse it to fit under the bed, which is why I bought it. But it's a keeper nonetheless.",

However, as an avid point & shoot hobbyist, I wanted to contribute my $0.02 worth in on this magnificent little gem. Small, simple, and almost goof-proof, this is an ideal inexpensive camera for anyone just getting started. No optical viewfinder, managable file sizes, and the typical unbeatable Nikon lens mean you get serious bang for your buck with this camera. Full auto works well, and easy access to simple manual control over the basic parameters of the capture process mean it is easy for anyone to make minor adjustments. Also, there are (I think) 16 or 20 custom auto modes, including fireworks, black & white, etc.<br /><br />HUGE plus: this camera runs on AA batteries. Spend about $25 once on a charger and two sets of high-capacity rechargables (2600miAh), and you will be all set. Regular Energizers are good for 100+ shots with the flash. The rechargables I bought are good for easily 250+ on a charge. MOney VERY well spent.<br /><br />For your dollar, this is a hard camera to beat--and what makes it great is that it's a Nikon--these people know lenses... and TRUST ME, it's all about the optics. Nikon simply rules in that dept, IMHO.",

I received mine as a review sample and it is one of the best constructed patch cables that I have used.<br /><br />Since I am using them is my music studio the best thing is they are low noise. Actually this is about noise-free as you can get. Part of the reason is the double shielding, but part is the overall construction.<br /><br />I also love the precision fit. I use these to patch bluetooth receivers in some of my amps and PA mixers for backing tracks.

            "question": "title: A good-enough camera for the price\ntext: The NexHT 1080P Pan Digital Tilt / 8X Zoom Indoor Smart Camera has all of the features that one would want from a wifi camera.  Panning, recording, remote viewing, infrared night vision and two-way audio.  It is also very small.  Designed to look like the Wyze cam, it is actually much smaller at 1.5\" wide and 3\" tall.  While cloud storage services are available, there is a microsd port for local recording.<br /><br />If one just needs a basic camera at a low price to monitor the home, this camera will serve well.  To compare to products such as Wyze, this camera comes up a little bit short.  The title of the product is carefully worded to show that the tilt function is \"digital\", which really means that the camera records with a wide-angled lens and when the phone is held in landscape mode, one can drag the image up and down.  When held in portrait mode, the entire height of the image can be seen and there is actually no tilt function.  Even so, in both modes, the camera image is squeezed together and not at the correct aspect ratio (I guess this depends on your phone's aspect ratio because the programmers chose not to maintain aspect ratio of the picture).<br /><br />The recording function is fairly basic.  It works like a dashcam in that the camera is always recording and will loop back over itself once the storage is filled.<br /><br />As with any other wifi home automation product, a separate account needs to be created to log in to the app -- an app one must trust to not send any sensitive information back to the mothership.  Personally, I plug this camera into a smart switch that I can turn on only when I'm out so that at least the camera isn't on when I'm at home.<br /><br />So this camera will do what it advertises but it there really isn't anything that sets it apart from the large number of products out there.  Wyze, while being a little bit bigger, costs only $30 and has actual tilt function.",

            "question": "title: I forgot how slow and tedious buttons are...\ntext: When society was transitioning from keyboard phones to touch phones, I held out as long as I could. I just thought touching letters was weird, and not accurate. After converting to touchscreen for several years, I tried to go back to a Blackberry with buttons and man, it's not like riding a bike at all. You simply cannot go back to buttons. Everything just seem so slow with buttons. That's because your brain has conditioned your fingers to touch. Pressing buttons will now feel extremely slow, we've lost that finger pressing muscle memory. Which brings me to my point, this is a slow and tedious way to save your credentials/passwords. LOL! The onboard software, if you can even call it that, doesn't help you differentiate password vs username vs websites. It would be nice to have folder levels where you can then drill in. For example, create a folder call Amazon, tap it to go inside and see the username and password. There is no such organization. You need to input the name of the website, your username, your password all on one string. So when you turn on the Pinmaster, you'll immediately see the first string you created. On the back of the retail box, it says ILLUMINATED DISPLAY as a feature. I take that to mean the screen has a backlit, but there is no such backlit. I don't think they claim backlit on the amazon product listing, so it's probably just an error in packaging design, a feature they decided to scrap or something. Lastly, you should know that all the special characters are in the 1 and 0 buttons. That's where you can find the @,&,%,^, etc. Maybe I'll entertain this thing when I have spare time, watching a movie, and this thing is in my hands like a fidget device. LOL! Other than that, I don't think I'll be putting any effort into this. I'll go 3-Stars!",

If you're looking to use this for something like I describe, it definitely works and will do the trick, but do yourself a favor and also get either an HDMI-to-SDI adapter or HDMI-to-CAT5/6 adapter, as those will both allow much longer runs of cable without signal degradation.<br />If you just want to split into two signals in the same room (such as, projector and TV), this should work a treat.",

            "question": "title: Gorgeous picture, full rich sound, easy to set up\ntext: After almost 3 weeks with this television, I am amazed and very, very happy with it. There's a lot to like here and a couple of things that I wasn't expecting from any television.<br /><br />First is the ease of set up. Our previous smart tv was a ROKU and reasonably simple to set up as well. The Google connection here means just signing in with your existing Google info and the tv uploads your existing apps. Just like moving to your new Android phone or tablet. All of our streaming apps populated and we were able to sign in without drama - HBOMAX, Prime, Paramount Plus, HULU and Netflix. We only stream and haven't used cable or satellite in 5 years, so easy app access with a new tv is important.<br /><br />The 4K picture is outstanding. There's no distortion in picture quality or digital noise even from old 1940s movies. The colors are rich and full and the tv settings let you adjust to your preference as well. We've watched a lot, A LOT of tv recently and every show on all platforms has been gorgeous. Frankly, we probably watch way too much tv as a rule and that's not going to change. I've been amazed at the picture quality difference between our year old HD tv and this one.<br /><br />We've connected Alexa to this tv and the voice controls work...most of the time. Using the voice control via the remote control renders better responses for sure. The tv has recognized a Fire stick, Roku Express stick, and a portable DVD player for us without any drama. We don't have a gaming system, though.... I'm considering buying one for this giant screen.<br /><br />But my final show stopper moment with this television has been the sound quality. We've never had a tv that didn't require a sound bar. Until now. Despite the tv being quite thin and lightweight, the speakers still produce a deep sound quality without any tinny undertones. The settings have a calibration option for the speakers that you definitely need to do for the best sound - it works. I truly believe this is the best television we've ever owned.",

For me, this is still pretty good I especially like the fact that the battery is integrated, so there is no need to purchase extra batteries and chargers like the other lights that I investigated before purchasing this one. Moreover, this will work with the same external batteries that I use for my tablets and phones, as well as the wall chargers and cables for those devices.<br /><br />Illumination is soft and can go from warm to cold, depending on your shooting environment. Since I am by no means a professional (or even an advanced) photographer, I found this light to be all that I need for easy to shoot videos and stills.<br /><br />One thing that I am on the fence about is the mount. It is a little shaky in that it tends to not firmly hold the light steady when installed in my camera's hot shoe. I can live with it since I keep my rig stationary, but if you are on the move that mount is going to be the weak spot.<br /><br />Despite my dislikes I intend to purchase one more of these as both a spare and as a second light source for some shots that will benefit from the added illumination.",

Other than that they are fine. nice picture, not noticable lag, they have vesa mounts and are in a triple eyefinity right now(you will need an active DP to hdmi but it works fine). I like them but the only other thought is they are not very tall in screen height and its more so noticable because of their length. The bezels arnt too bad if you make them overlap.

Vertical Side-Pockets are a minus.\ntext: I have been trying to find a Neoprene case, with Handles, for a large (17&#34;) laptop and was so happy to find this on Amazon.<br /><br />1. The handle is pliable and comfortable. The material is strong and sewn in tightly. It does not feel as though it will tear out. Please note, the handles are not immediate apparent - they are tucked down into the side pockets (When this arrived, I thought they had sent the wrong item.  I had to fish around in the pockets to find the handles)<br />2. The zipper works but is not as sturdy as I would like for such a large case. The zipper pulls are also a bit small. The zipper is sewn in evenly. I think with careful use, the zipper will stand up to time.<br />3. There is NOT any additional lining inside this bag, so no added protection. Just the Neoprene.<br />4. There are outer D-rings for a shoulder strap, but a shoulder strap is not included. I am not sure why they give you the hardware, but not the strap.<br />5. The reason I cannot give this 5 stars is the pockets. There is a deep, vertical pocket on each side, that is only as wide as the handle. Very difficult to get your items out of these pockets. A horizontal pocket would be more useful and user friendly. I personally find I cannot use these pockets.",

            "question": "title: BEST KEYBOARD EVER MADE (IMHO) BUT HAS SOME SMALL ISSUES\ntext: Have used this keyboard for many years at work and home and I wouldn't use any other keyboard.  It is that comfortable.  I would hate to pay the price they are asking for these now.  Hate to say this for those of you who want one, but I just bought one for $2.99 from Goodwill.  It is well worth it to have a spare on hand; actually have 2 spares, as obviously these are expensive to replace if you buy new. These keyboards have both USB and PS/2 type connectors and two USB ports in the back of the keyboard which I have never used.  I tried out the USB ports in the back and they do not work.  There could be a couple of reasons for this.  One might be that in order for them to function, you might have to use the USB connector for the keyboard, rather than the round PS/2 connector.  Another reason is that my keyboard does not connect directly to the computer, but goes through a KVM switch.  Through the switch, the keyboard may not receive enough power to power the USB ports.  I don't have a USB connector on my KVM switch, so I have to use the PS/2 round connector.  The only problem that I have encountered with this keyboard is the feet that elevate the back of the keyboard to a comfortable angle, tend to fall off.  I have lost a couple and cannot find replacements.  If you are used to a flat keyboard, the tilted ergo keyboard does take some getting used to, but once you have used it for a while, you will never go back to a flat keyboard again.  Microsoft has some newer versions of this keyboard, but I don't think they are an improvement and they are expensive.",

The first test was just completed:  a 2-week cruise around Alaska (Ketchikan, Endicott Arm, Juneau, Hoonah, Anchorage, Kodiak, Homer, and Sitka).  I wanted a full-sized keyboard, portable, and easy to manage that would work with my iPad Pro.<br /><br />I chose this for the size, the fact that it is powered via my iPad (rather than needing to be charged), and the fact that it's a wired connection via the lightning cable rather than Bluetooth.  Nothing against Bluetooth, but not having to deal with pairing simplifies things a lot.<br /><br />This performed beautifully!  Connected easily, and no problems at all with performance.  It has some nifty shortcuts, many I didn't use, but at least they're available.  Despite being a full-size keyboard, the small size means I can tuck this into my carryon along with other necessities and it doesn't take up much space at all.  It's durable, too -- the wire connector appears to be sturdy.  I used this a couple of times per day to record events and activities, so it was in and out of my bag often.  No problems at all.<br /><br />It's coming along on my next adventure: a cruise around the North Atlantic (including Greenland, Iceland, and Norway) for 6 weeks.",

I'll attempt to not repeat him, so will confine my review to why I awarded my review sample five stars.<br /><br />Foremost, I love the convenience of having an all-in-one power and charging station for my phone, tablet and a few smaller electronic items. It takes up one full two outlet wall connectors in my music studio where I am using it. One of the plugs is a dummy that does not draw electricity. This ensures that you do not overload a circuit as well as providing stability to the rather large unit.<br /><br />At 15 Amps (1675 Watts) this is more than sufficient for the small amperage devices I am using (although I do have a 5 Watt RMS output tube amp plugged into it as well.) Where I live the power fluctuates too wildly to plug anything of value directly into a wall outlet, so this is essential.<br /><br />It's also a convenience with respect to the swivel. Most of the devices I am powering with this use wall warts, and even with the swivel I can only plug four in at any given time. While that blocks two of the outlets, had it not swiveled I would have probably lost one more outlet.<br /><br />I have found this so useful that I intend to order another to place in my gig bag for playing out. There is always a dearth of outlets on most of the small venue stages where I play, and the power in most of those places is usually abysmal. One of these for a small PA and keyboard will afford adequate protection as well as being conveniently small.",

I tested the fit with the following phones and they are a perfect match:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001EZYMF4 Sennheiser CX 300 II Precision Enhanced Bass Earbuds]]<br />[[ASIN:B004PO10E2 Shure SE215-CL Sound Isolating Earphones]]<br />[[ASIN:B000XPG2QI Etymotic Research HF5 Portable In-Ear Earphones]]<br /><br />Of course I also tested them with the [[ASIN:B00G4UQ6U8 Brainwavz S1 In Ear Headphones]] which I expected to fit and they did. Although many of the phones with which I tested these come with their own case, none of them are are as sturdy or as protective as this one. For low-end phones this will probably outlast the phones themselves, and will be ready their their replacement. For the higher end phones this is an investment - and an inexpensive one at they - for protecting the instrument from damage.",

I could get a brand name for same price or cheaper, but what drew me to this one is that (besides being very happy with their DVD player) is that this is smaller than many others on the market. I already have a huge, heavy blu-ray player, and I wanted something smaller, lighter, and easier to move around. The small size of this is perfect. It is bigger than their mini DVD player, but smaller than nearly any other blu-ray player.  It also has similar features that made me first select their DVD player (still small, but still has remote and front  display).<br /><br />This Blu-ray disc player is petite but still has full functionality- ie; remote, front digital display, and controls. It works. It comes with HDMI cable as well as an RCA cable, and coaxial cable. I dont need the latter two. Good size remote comes with  batteries. Easy for me to set up-- I just plugged the HDMI cable into the port on the player, and one into the back of my TV. Then plugged the player into the wall. ALL WORKS WELL. I popped in a variety of movies, and had no issue having them play.<br /><br />I dont often watch DVDs or Blu-ray discs, but I want the option.

            "question": "title: Nice Deal but Firmware is Clunky\ntext: This player is well worth the asking price, and I've not come accross any feature that doesn't work. Streaming, DVD, Network, USB all 'just work,' though I've not tested some features like 3D, Blu-Ray, and Wireless. The USB input sees my self-powered USB Pocketec hard drive as a media, and will play from it whatever formats the player supports. You just click your way to the directory on the drive that contains your media files. There is one issue: jpg thumbnails take 'forever' to load, much slower than a computer. If you have several hundred jpgs, it could take 5 or 10 minutes just for all the thumbnails to be displayed. There doesn't appear to be a cache either, so each time you load the directory anew, you have to wait.<br /><br />The streaming video (I've only tested Netflix thus far) works pretty good. Also, DVD's play nicely and load quickly. However, the LG Apps are pretty lame - mostly stupid games you will not likely be using. :) Also, the interface is slow, so you have to wait a few seconds - 30 seconds for the main menu system to load when first turning on the device. However, the connection is pretty robust. I've only experienced very brief 'dropouts,' when the connection is lost, so far.<br /><br />Overall I would say I am quite pleased with what I bought for the money. This was a replacement for my satellite service which I dropped for lack of use. Now for a nominal fee to netflix or Amazon (Pandora is, I think totally free), I have a wide assortment of home entertainment on demand. That is worth the 169.00 I paid for the unit. I recommend this model for anyone looking for a full-featured, internet ready, blu-ray/media player on a budget.<br /><br />Terry",

The bands were not attached but were easy to slip on (there's a small little nub on the band end that attaches to the watch, color side will face down). There is also a screen protector to peel off the watch face. The charger is magnetic and the charging process may have taken an hour (I just plugged into my computer).<br /><br />Directions<br />-These were really fantastic. They lay things out in detail but also keep it brief for the many different options available. Turn on the bluetooth mode on your phone. I found the app \"Da Fit App\" from the product description, though the directions only show a QR code. From there it was opening the app and doing a quick profile setup (Sex, Height, Weight, Birth Year). It automatically scanned for the phone and the letters displayed on the screen and it was the only one shown so that was quick. I do wish it would pop up a notification that the pairing was successful but there is a watch icon in the app at the bottom. If you click that it displays \"Connected\" right at the top and shows your exact watch. It also let's you customize the \"face\" of the watch from within the app. I like Dial 3.<br /><br />The App<br />-Very well laid out and some details were provided earlier but you can adjust the notifications you receive and it all pairs through Bluetooth so as long as they are on (and you accept push notifications on the phone) you'll receive the notifications on the phone. You can make a lot of the adjustments you want through the watch, but the app can allow for a faster level to set all at once.<br /><br />The Modes<br />Phone calls, sleep (need to leave on during sleep), heart rate test, steps, training (stopwatch), blood pressure, SpO2 Test, Weather, Reminders, Shutter (photos/video), start/stop songs, Alarms, Timer, Stopwatch, Theater Mode (turns off vibrating and brightness), Move reminders, Drink reminders (stay healthy), Health reminders (menstrual, pregnancy, gender health).<br /><br />The watch will sync to your timezone once the app is set and you can also get weather notifications which I set inside the app.<br /><br />I am really thrilled to use the watch and was able to even deny a call earlier without having to grab my phone (unwanted caller).

In terms of the usability and comfort of the keyboard itself, the quality is simply unmatched. My last keyboard had flimsy keys and would sometimes type 2 or 3 letters with one keystroke, while other keys didn't seem to work at all. This one is exactly the opposite - it feels great to type on even if it's a little undersized, and all the keys are exactly where you'd expect them to be. Having two shift keys is also quite nice, that's one of my main gripes with every other iPad keyboard.<br /><br />The cover feature is also very good, though the hinge magnet does seem a little bit less \"snappy\" than the smart cover. It works fine, but it just seems a little bit lower quality. When closed, it blends perfectly with the iPad itself and creates a seamless brushed metal case all the way around, aside from the two ends of the slot that the iPad fits into during use. It is slightly thicker than the iPad 2. One thing this product has over many other keyboard covers is that you can use portrait mode, though as stated in other reviews, that position is not quite as steady as the magnet in the holding slot does not work in portrait orientation.<br /><br />The battery life is also quite impressive. The manual claims 6 months (2 hrs/day usage) on a single charge. I can attest to that since I've had it for several months and have yet to charge it a second time (although I use it probably an hour a day, if that).<br /><br />The last point is the price. Having used it, I'm confident it's a good buy. Might be a bit on the expensive side, but you're getting your money's worth - it does not seem rinky-dink like a lot of these other keyboards. This is clearly a professional, high-quality product.<br /><br />For me it's turned typing on the iPad from a headache/nightmare into, basically, using a normal keyboard. I've seen a couple other reviews that complained about the protective edges getting in the way, but I keep my wrists up when I type so it's not a problem for me. The only thing I miss from a normal keyboard is a delete button (the 'delete' on this keyboard is backspace) and the home/end keys. There may be a way to do those, but I haven't used it long enough to find out.<br /><br />I'm a software developer with roughly 10 years of solid typing experience, and this is not just a great iPad keyboard, but in itself a very nice keyboard, period. I wouldn't mind having to use it on a normal computer. Overall, it's simply amazing. I typed this entire review with it and had no problems whatsoever. I highly recommend it.",

            "question": "title: Great features and sound quality! Some caveats\ntext: I've been a fan of Panasonic's consumer electronics since their camcorder days, so I was excited to try these! I've owned many of the cheap Chinese wireless earbuds, and generally sound is good enough for music or listening to videos but I've never found one with a microphone decent enough for sound quality outside of the major brands (Apple, Samsung, etc).<br />Well, I'm happy to say these Panasonic 'buds don't skimp! They don't cost as much as the big players but the sound quality both for listening and microphone use is head and shoulders over the cheap knock offs. The noice cancelling feature is pretty amazing as well, and overall I'm very pleased with the feature set and quality of those features. But here's the caveat:<br />The ergonomics aren't great. Touch sensitive buds are difficult for me because I'm the kind of person who moves around a lot and needs to adjust my earbuds to keep them from falling out. But touch sensitivity means sometimes I'm accidentally activating things when I don't want to. I also didn't find some of the features intuitive and had to learn how to use them properly (changing noise cancelling modes for example). They also have rather bright blinking LEDs but you'll only notice that in a dark room. All in all, this is a good product that could be made better in a second edition. For the price, I think it fits squarely between the polished big name brands and the cheap knock offs. This is a good product, it works and doesn't exactly what it says. But it isn't perfect.",

(Maths never been my strong point- so maybe this was just me.. but a quick size reference before ordering will give you some real time idea!)<br /><br />Used indoors- we didn’t need water weights.. but have if/when necessary. Not sure how easy they’ll be to use if using on a camp out… Water can be sparse- I’d probably weight down with sandbag or cinder block?<br /><br />If following instructions it’s a bit contradicting to state… “Do not fold or roll screen.” To store in the provided carry bag- The only way to fit the screen in is to roll..?? Carefully doing so, we blindly followed and hoping it won’t cause any issues- I wish it provided more clarity in this department!<br /><br />As for screen itself.. just be sure to eliminate any light source from behind it since it can offset the picture from projector light on front side. Doing this gives a solid image… It’s awesome! Used at our teen sons bday party with group of friends- we set up big screen in our game room and all had a solid view of movie marathon- zero complaints.. a huge node from a picky crowd!<br /><br />Overall, as our 1st screen purchase.. it was so much better then using the wall or a sheet tacked up like we have!

We have a lot of family/church movie nights and have tried rigging up different screens.  I set this up by myself.  I would recommend 2 people.  And I should have put the Velcro Screen on first while it was on the ground.  Having it deflated and on the ground will allow for zero wrinkles on the screen.  The Velcro that holds the screen is more than an inch thick and very sticky.  This does Not sag at the top and the screen does Not weigh it down.  It will need to be staked down, but they provide all the hooks and string to do that. This is one of the best screen setups I have used.  We use to rent much smaller screen than this at more then half the cost.  Well worth the asking price.  The 17 foot is extremely large too!!!",

It was tied into everything and kept giving me alerts and so eventually I got tired of it.  My wife also had a first generation Samsung Gear watch and that was about the same as the Moto.<br />Well, fast forward a few years and now my wife, daughter, son and daughter-in-law all have newer smart watches (Apple Watches and Fitbit) and they all love them.  It was time to get a new phone, so I got a Samsung  S20 FE and then decided to get the Samsung watch.  I saw on the reviews that it really works well with Samsung phones and so I decided to get the Watch 3.  I was looking at the Watch 2, which had a few less features and then I found the Watch 3 in the 41mm size and then found a refurbished one so I ended up paying about the same for the Watch 3 as I would have for the Watch 2.<br />I'm very impressed with the watch and really love it.  I didn't get the one with a cell phone, it just connects to my phone with bluetooth and/or wifi, but it's really amazing.  I get my messages, and can turn off the ones that I don't want and then I also get all the health apps.  So, now it tells me to get off my chair and walk around and does EKG and stress tesing and Oxygen levels..<br />I was concerned that the 41 mm might be too small, but it is a great size for me as you can see from the pic.  I have had a Citizen Echo Drive for more than 10 years and it is a little larger, but I like the size of the Watch 3 better.<br />If you are thinking about getting a watch, this one is a good deal right now and I believe it does work best if you use it with a Samsung phone.",

            "question": "title: So easy to use.\ntext: We have a TP-Link router, so getting an extender of the same brand seemed to fit the bill in extending our Wi-Fi issues. We live in a 150-year-old apartment building with very thick walls. The cable for the TV and Internet is located in the living room, whereas my office is on the completely opposite side of the building. There are about three walls in between, so my Internet was shoddy at best. I have an iPhone, MacBook Pro, a Toshiba PC, and some handheld gaming consoles, and the only one to get decent service in my office was the MBP.<br /><br />I ordered the signal extender and stuck it into our bedroom, which is the halfway point from the router to my office. Setting up the device was extremely easy, and took all of a couple minutes (half of which was me making sure I did it right). At first, I noticed no boost in Wi-Fi to my office. Before, the strength of signal reaching back there was about two or three bars on my Toshiba PC, and the first or no arc on my iPhone. However, after going about my business, I found that my Toshiba PC only once has dropped under three bars, and sometimes even reaches its full signal strength--but that's happened once. My iPhone is about the same, but sometimes it does show full signal strength as well.<br /><br />I never get any more disconnected webpages in my office, and I can go about my work and non-work without having to worry about taking the power off my PC and dashing to the living room.<br /><br />Only once in the past month or so has it lost signal, but it picked up right away. It also acts as a nice nightlight with its warm blue glow, illuminating the path to the door so I can get out for a quick midnight getaway to the throne room and back.",

Because my previous router was a TP-Link router also, I was skeptical about this one at first. I was actually leaning towards a $300 Asus gaming router (I don’t game that much, I just wanted something powerful). But truth is, my previous TP-Link was just end of life—almost five years old. I’m pretty certain that WiFi tech was going out. I found an article titled something like “Best 2020 Routers” by Tom’s Guide and this was his #1 ranked router out of 10! After reading some other reviews and resources about it, I pulled the trigger. This router quadrupled my speeds (which wasn’t hard to do I suppose since my previous internet speed was so intermittent and slow).<br /><br />I am extremely satisfied with this router. I’m a lv 4 IT engineer for a big company, and I can tell you that this is a quality product. You are getting the quality of these expensive gaming routers for half or quarter the cost. And the newer admin interface is very easy and simple. The setup for this router was easier than I’ve ever experienced. I have 25-30 wireless connections by the way and this thing is handling it like a champ. My other router really struggled with that.<br /><br />I highly recommend this whether you’re technical or not, and whether you’re needing lots of bandwidth or just for basic internet usage.",

And every night the iPad was sliding off the bed (even though it is in a silicone case) and I was having to dig it out in the mornings for him. Not once have I had to do this.<br /><br />I had contemplated a few Pinterest 'hacks' that suggested (for example) using Command Hooks attached to the wall and then sitting the iPad down into those (the big 5# ones) hooks. Problem for us is my kid has seizures that are not well controlled by meds, so all I could 'see' in my mind's eye was him seizing and in the convulsing or 'rooting' he does with most of his seizures (or unconsciously standing up then falling back down) one of those seemingly harmless plastic Command hooks gouging his eyeball out or ripping a nostril open. (If you knew all the off the wall sh** that can and does go wrong with seizures, you'd get why all the one-in-a-billions go through my head!)<br /><br />Anyway, this was the best $ I've spent in a long time.

I was working with hot tungsten lamps for a video job in a semi-permanent studio by one of my clients, and it was basically a 500 Watt bulb in a dish, which obviously casts a very harsh bright light with lots of shadow. I picked out some shoot-through umbrellas to get some basic diffusion of the light, and added this piece to go in between the light fixture and the stand to hold the umbrella rod. If you have worked with light setups like this before, you should be familiar as it is pretty standard/basic. Like other adapters of this sort, there is a hinge that lets you tilt the light to get a little extra control over where you are aiming. If you are using this with off camera flashes that use a shoe mount, it already comes with that preinstalled.  In my case, I didn't need the cold shoe mount (the video lights screw into a 1/4\" 20 threaded bolt), so I just removed the shoe mount which revealed exactly the connection I needed underneath.

It took until the spring thaw to get into this project again and while it was not quick, the install turned out to not be so bad.  We ran lines for three cameras out to monitor our entry ways and the fourth for our commons area inside.  I am actually pretty happy with the outdoor night shots and we have captured lots of rabbits in the yard.  It is decent quality, perhaps not razor sharp, but pretty good.  We found a good location off our garage for the device itself which allowed up pretty open lines to run the wires, only once having to really fish it above the ceiling.

It is such a simple concept, since most of these smaller cameras have the same voltage requirements as the big NPF batteries, I couldn't believe the market hadn't embraced mass producing the concept.<br />I was so glad to see devices like this have hit the market, I had to try it! I'm happy to say, it not only works just as I expected it to (provided you have the right size dummy battery adapter), but they improved upon the design by adding USB ports and even USB charging! So now if I don't want to use my dummy battery on, say, my A7Rii, I can use this as a charger to top off the internal battery while recording speeches, AND top off my phone and/or power a recorder or monitor while I'm at it!<br />These guys thought of everything, even offering USB C or micro USB charging so that you can use whatever cables you happen to have around.

As a present to myself, I purchased the [[ASIN:B083W88L5H Huion Kamvas 13]] to get started.  Huion is known for providing great quality in their products while keeping the prices affordable.<br /><br />As anyone who has used a drawing tablet can attest, with the tablet taking up the main desk space, it's difficult to access the keyboard for all the shortcut keys that help to make the job easier.  One option is to use an under-the-desk keyboard tray, but I really don't like doing that as I tend to kick the tray when I get in and out of my chair.  Others purchase more expensive hotkey devices such as this one.<br /><br />While the HUION Mini KeyDial KD100 does not have fancy led lights or e-ink display on the keys, it does have the basics of what one would need.  The keys are laid out like the number pad on a full 101-key keyboard and the dial can be used to adjust anything that needs a kind of analog input (volume, zoom, brush size, etc).  The keys are preconfigured for the most common shortcuts but each key can be customized.<br /><br />The Mini KeyDial came in an oddly plain white box with the name Huion printed on top.  It's almost like this is a rebranded white-box device but that really isn't a problem.  It simply means that the unboxing experience isn't as satisfying as the drawing tablet itself.  Once connected to the Huion drivers, the device feels fully integrated to Huion's ecosystem.<br /><br />It is managed in the same driver/software that Huion uses for its tablets so that once you'll be able to get up and running customizing the buttons immediately.<br /><br />Last thing to point out is that the dial on this device can support Microsoft's own RaDial drivers to emulate the dial that Microsoft introduced a few years ago for the Surface Studio, allowing it to interact natively with built-in Windows utilities.",

I'm also finding that I can't pass up a good pair of bluetooth headphones.<br /><br />So of the over-head style bluetooth headphones, I've run across problems with short battery life (had one pair that lasts only 3 hours), too tight against the head, presses on the ear (supra-aural) and gets sweaty, active noise cancelling that can't turn on independently of the bluetooth function, and no carrying case.<br /><br />This pair of RCA Active noise cancelling headphones don't have any of those problems.  I sit at my desk all day with an air outlet behind me that is constantly blowing.  I'm able to use them the entire day with music playing without the batteries running down.  I don't keep the noise cancelling on the entire time but when I do, the fan noise is completely blocked out.  Being circumaural headphones, the ear cups completely surround my ears and do not press on them.  In addition, the spring isn't too tight to make me feel like my head is being squeezed in a vice.<br /><br />As far as sound quality, because the speakers are not pressing against the ear, the sound seems to have a wider-room feel, making me feel even more like I don't have headphones on.<br /><br />Overall, I'm quite satisfied with this purchase and don't feel the need to splurge and buy the much more expensive Sony and Bose products.",

(The tablet comes with an old-style 12W USB charger that is pathetically slow.)<br /><br />USB-C PD (for “Power Delivery”) is a new power standard that increases power levels--up to 100W--so that mobile devices charge much faster.  PD determines how much power each device needs, and ensures that it is NOT overcharged.<br /><br />PD chargers have USB-C ports, so you need a cable with an oval USB-C plug (rather than the familiar flat USB plug) to connect your tablet, cellphone, etc. to the charger.  This cable with one lightning cable plug and one USB-C plug is exactly what you need for an Apple tablet or phone that uses a lightning cable.  It’s amazing how much faster my iPad Air charges when I use the 18W charger with this cable!<br /><br />The cable’s braided cover is long-lasting.

The features of being able to talk through it and being able to move the camera through the app are fantastic.  I especially love being able to move the camera remotely so that I can see different rooms  I wish my other cameras did that.

            "question": "title: Very happy with the Canon ELPH 100 HS (Grey)!\ntext: The Canon ELPH 100 HS is beautiful, and the Smart Auto feature takes great, no-stress photos for the user who has little or no experience with camera equipment.<br /><br />Before buying the Canon ELPH 100, I read reviews and did a lot of research online to find a point-and-shoot camera that I would enjoy within the under-$200 price range.  There are a lot of good products from which to choose.<br /><br />I next went to Best Buy, Office Depot, and Sears to hold different point-and-shoot cameras made by the major producers:  Canon, Nikon, Sony, Olympus, etc.  For me, these visits to different retailers is an important part of the process of buying a point-and-shoot digital camera for the first time.<br /><br />Another important step is to learn whether or not the camera's software is compatible with your desktop computer.  Because my computer is old (2006), I had to research compatibility with the different cameras that I liked.  You can find the information at the product websites.<br /><br />Canon has a very user-friendly website that influenced my purchase considerably.<br /><br />I had XP Service Pack 2 on an older Dell Dimension E310.  For the Canon, I had to download XP Service Pack 3.<br /><br />I ordered the camera from Amazon.com.  From the moment I opened the box of the Canon ELPH 100 HS, I liked everything that I saw.  The instructions are clear and organized well.<br /><br />Finally, I love the pictures that I am taking.  No, they are not the same quality as those taken by friends and family members who own thousands of dollars worth of camera equipment.  However, these photos are beautiful and fun to take.<br /><br />I am practicing now so that I will be ready to take photos at baby showers and graduations in the next couple of weeks.<br /><br />Is it easy to learn how to use the Canon ELPH 100 HS?  It is VERY easy to learn how to use Smart AUTO.  The sliding Smart AUTO button is on the top of the camera:  you slide the latch to Smart AUTO, and you are finished.  The camera \"decides\" whether or not to activate flash and also determines other settings.<br /><br />To learn to use all of the optional features (P mode) is fun but not essential to photographing great photos right away.<br /><br />Another reason that I bought the Canon ELPH 100 is that it is considered to be among the best in its price range -- and possibly THE BEST -- in low-light conditions.  The only time the colors seemed to be distorted somewhat was when I took photos of pets sitting in a semi-darkened room while they were directly under the strong light of a table lamp.  I found that the bright light from the lamp washed over all objects close to the lamp; the objects outside of the lamplight were fainter in color.  Since then, I've taken the precaution of composing photos more carefully so that I am not creating a spotlight effect.<br /><br />I read that the ELPH 300 could be a better choice if you plan to use the video features a lot.  For me, the video features on the ELPH 100 are fine.<br /><br />While in Playback (viewing photos that I have taken), I am learning how to use the displayed menus to select options such as Slideshow and Erase -- so far, so good.  While not as easy as Smart Auto, the menus are fairly intuitive.<br /><br />I have been very pleased.  The sheen of the dog's coat, the warm expression in her eyes, and the mysterious, bold gaze of the cat -- all captured beautifully.",

This camera works fine enough to view what I need it to, but is not the fine HD view you get facing into the home of course. I was really interested in it as the ad had mentioned it was Alexa compatible which would have been great viewing thorough the Show 8. But as noted in an earlier review, they are working on the Amazon Alexa Agreement, per their customer service rep. I would have preferred that instead having to have the app opened on my phone.<br /><br />Please note when setting the camera up, no matter how strong your wi-fi seems where you are using the camera, it states in the manual to be by your router to set it up. And even though I have no problems setting up other items away from the router, I had to be next to the router to set up the camera. But after initial set up, it works just fine where I want it to.<br /><br />Update:, my camera stopped functioning as it runs though the app Smart Life, and it looks like you have to register and/or set up an account with them. As this is the only camera I have going thru that app, I did not register with them so the camera is useless. As I have a lot of Blink cameras, this is no longer needed.",

Is a real beast. And nice at twice the price. One thing I like about this rig over some other rigs I've got, is that you can take it off your shoulder and put it on a tripod on the spot. I love the fact that it's got quarter inch and 3/8-inch screws and slots this will virtually hold anything you got. The handle grips are nonslip and with 360 degrees turn it's really hip. You can hold up to 44 pounds which would be terrible on your arms for any length of time, but with this mounted on your shoulder or a tripod that time is just fine. I love this shoulder rig, what can I say, but you better get yours right away, because it will make your filming better in just one day. I highly recommend my friend.

            "question": "title: A Fantastic, Well thought out Tripod\ntext: I have three main uses for tripods, food photography, nature photography and to hold up a spotting scope.  This tripod succeeds wonderfully at two of those.  It is great for nature photography and supporting the spotting scope.  I am 6' 3\" and I love that height of this tripod. even without extending the center post, I can comfortably use the tripod when standing.<br /><br />This is a fantastic birdwatching tripod for my spotting scope.  The carbon fiber material is light and rugid. Vanguard has remembered the little things, for example, the upper legs are padded which is huge in when trying to spot an owl in Minnesota at twenty below.  The insulation makes the tripod much more comfortable to handle, equally when shooting images of Northern lights.<br /><br />The legs are fairly sturdy although I feel that here is a little more play in the carbon fiber over my older aluminum, Bogen tripod. I was a little disappointed that there are just a few angle settings for the legs.  They click into 30 and about 60 degrees.  It would be nice to have more granular settings, so I find myself altering leg lengths more than my other tripod. The feet are well designed with hard steel spikes with nice rubber feet for indoor uses.  Both options allow for good stable footings.<br /><br />Also there are some great other details like leveling bubbles on the top of the tripod and ball head.  Also, I like that they though to include a hook at the bottom of the center post for adding stability weights.  The leg releases are easy to use and have held tight during all my time in the field with the tripod.<br /><br />Where I wish they had put more into this tripod is the ball head. It doesn't seem to live up to the tripod body.  I miss a pan handle and while I appreciate the feel and functionality of the locking knobs, it just seems like it is not the pro quality of the rest of the tripod.  There is a second leveling bubble on the head itself which is fantastic.  But probably the biggest drawback is the quick release plate.  It is not quick at all, it requires quite a bit of screwing with thumbscrew to attach.  Also there is not set screw on the \"quick\" release plate.<br /><br />Pros<br />+ Height<br />+ padded legs for comfort in cold weather<br />+ Light Weight<br />+ Great feet, both the grippy robber shoes and the steel spikes<br />+ built in leveling bubbles<br />+ Functional and strong leg locks<br />+ built in hook on bottom of center post<br />+ Second leveling bubble on the head<br /><br />Cons<br />- No built in strap<br />- Carrying case is ok (this is more a neutral than a con)<br />- the head is not great<br />- limited leg angles<br />- Head could be better<br />- Somewhat awkward and slow quick release plates<br />- Lacks a panning arm.<br /><br />In General, this is an awesome tripod, but for the money I would have expected a little more, especially a strap and a better head unit.  But I have to admit I love this tripod.  I would have put 4.5 stars if possible, but for $500 my expectation for a \"Professional\" tripod head is a little higher.  But for my uses it's awesome, it holds the Spotting Scope will but again, lack of a panning arm hinders it.  From the shoulders down, the best I've seen.",

Keys feel solid and type well, with medium-high resistance, and are somewhere in the middle between quiet and noisy.  The keyboard isn't as noisy as most mechanical keyboards (like a Cherry blue/green) but it's still noisy enough to bother my wife if I'm using it in bed when she wants to sleep.  The backlighting is well-balanced, enough to make keys clear and easy to read but not so much that it looks freaky at night.

            "question": "title: A Good DVD Player for Those With Limited Needs\ntext: Portable DVD players have their use and the Verezano Portable DVD Player is a decent one for general needs. With a nine inch screen area, stereo speakers, and a swivel screen, it’s a good DVD player for children and others and it’s nice to have when on vacation or in other situations when the kids need some electronic entertainment.<br /><br />We use portable DVD players in my household mostly for child entertainment so I often base buying decisions and reviews from that perspective. This portable DVD player does seem to have the minimum requirements to keep the kids happy and occupied. It is made mostly from plastic and is lightweight. And kids love the swivel screen. I have had to step in a few times and calm them down, as they love grabbing the screen and twisting it back and forth.<br /><br />I find the functions on this portable DVD player simple to use and my kids had no trouble picking up on the operations. I did notice, however, that the remote control does not always make the unit respond. I often have to grab it and point more directly at the unit to get it to accept my command and even then, it takes a couple of pushes before anything happens. It isn’t a battery issue, as it does this even when the batteries are fresh.<br /><br />Speaking of batteries, probably my greatest problem with this Verezano DVD player is the battery life in the unit itself. A charge is good for only about 2 hours, and that means it will die out after a one full movie is watched and sometimes even sooner. This means a long road trip in the car or flight on a plane will be too much. The unit will die out and have to be recharged long before your destination is reached.<br /><br />So, judging this product from different angles, it seems to have the adequate properties to make it a worthwhile purchase for those with limited needs. My kids really like the swivel screen and they quickly figured out how to make it the player operate. But the battery life and issues with the remote control convince me to lower my rating to 3 stars. You basically get what you pay for, and that means a very average product.",

The one issue I quickly found is that the counter balanced weight of the base is not even. This is disappointing as the goose-neck arm allows for a great variety of positions, but due to the non-centered base, it will easily tip over unless the weight of the tablet is directed in the same direction as the bulk of the base. This can be corrected with placing more weight, like books, over the base. However, this requires extra clutter in my work area. I'm using the tablet holder beside my work area to follow video tutorials, it does keep my tablet safe from my messy products and supplies, but the base isn't centered so it requires one extra step on my part to use it easily. I find the price fair, but the balance of weight on the base is disappointing.  Thanks for reading, if this was Helpful to you, please click the button below.",

            "question": "title: A No Frills, High Quality Organizer for My Action Cam\ntext: This is not the most gorgeous, whistles and bells laden case out there, but what it lacks in aesthetic glitz it makes up for in utilty and ruggedness.  For me, I was looking for a way to organize a Sony HDR-AS100VR POV Action Video Camera with a couple of mounts and their tiny remote monitor.  So I did not need a lot of space, just a protective, organizing case.  This is not the biggest case in the world so if you are running multiple GoPros with a ton of mounts, it's not for you.  It will work fine for my single cam needs.  Personally I love that I can pack this in my luggage.<br /><br />As for organization... There is a nice side pocket for cables, three bays for storing the components, including one Velcro adjustable bay so your can customize two of the bays a little. Internally, there is another side pocket, two multiuse but smallish mesh pockets and three elastic bays to store SD cards.  So you have enough room for everything you would need for a personal Action Cam and perfect for what I was looking for.<br /><br />The case is lightly padded, but offers ok protection for traveling in a backpack etc.  Not waterproof but probably somewhat water resistant for rain and light splashing  The zippers are reinforced at the ends to avoid fraying as are handles and zipper pulls.  It really seems to be designed with long lifespan in mind.  The looks are understated but classy.  All in all, perfect for what I was looking for.<br /><br />Pros<br />+ Rugged Design<br />+ Small for a single camera set up<br />+ Will pack well into luggage<br />+ Good organizational pockets inside and out<br />+ Well manufactured and reinforced<br /><br />Cons<br />- Not very big so might be to small if you have multiple mounts<br />- Not the most beautiful bag on the market, but very functional",

            "question": "title: Great tablet for the price.\ntext: For $80, this tablet is actually pretty good. It's about the same height as my Note8, but almost double the width. Still, the tablet-exclusive apps on the Google Play Store work without issue on it, though of course you're going to sacrifice some viewing due to the smaller scale.<br /><br />When I got the tablet I knew it wasn't going to be anything spectacular. At $80, I knew it wasn't going to compete with the devices I was used to, but it still was nice to have to act as a tablet to play my tablet-exclusive games on and for the kids to use to play their games. The screen of course isn't the sharpest, and out of the box it isn't as sensitive in all areas. Two of the first games I installed were a couple of pinball apps, and the screen had a hard time detecting my presses on the left side.<br /><br />The screen is quite sharp considering it's a &#34;low-end&#34; tablet, and the feel is very solid. Has a nice textured back to it which makes me reconsider if I'll get a case. The screen does retain fingerprints easily but a quick wipe on a shirt resolves all issues.<br /><br />There is a microSD slot which is a nice addition; I can transfer any transferable games to that since this tablet has only 16 GB (less considering there's only 14.-something and some of that is taken up by the OS).<br /><br />Operating the OS is super sluggish. Takes four times as long to do something as it would on a beefier device. But actual in-app operations aren't as bad. A little more sluggish than on a beefier device, but not enough to notice that much.<br /><br />Since this tablet doesn't have a phone speaker at the top, the actual main speaker is located in its stead. As a result, you get a nice, loud, crisp sound whenever you watch a movie or play a game.<br /><br />All in all, a fantastic little tablet for the price; I hope the missing sensitivity spots are temporary. The screen isn't as smooth as others, but I'm willing to forgive that for the price.",

            "question": "title: Superb Tablet Stand, Suitable for Industrial Use\ntext: I have a 10\" tablet and it primarily gets used as an e-reader and as a music streaming device. It's a great device and I love it, but I do get frustrated with figuring out where to put it when I am streaming music through it. Although it is a relatively small device it does take up some room on the desk when in a stand case. I have tried suction mounts to attach it to a window and that works fine but the window cannot move and when the window is cold the suction mount lets go. This flexible mount for tablets is a very good solution for my needs and is far better constructed than suggested by the product description.<br /><br />This is a simple mount in concept and design. It is flexible coil tube with a screw-on vice clamp attached on one end and an adjustable frame-style bracket attached via a ball joint to the other. In the box the unit comes unassembled and requires less than two minutes to put together. When finished, the whole thing is approximately 3' long.<br /><br />Everything about this mounting stand suggests that it is built to last and is designed to hold up under heavy use. The coil tube is about the heaviest I have ever seen: it is roughly a half inch in diameter and is exceptionally stiff which makes it well suited for supporting the weight of the tablet. The item description here says it will support 2.2 pounds but it will support a little more than that (though I would not try to put much extra on there, particularly if the coil is horizontal).<br /><br />The coil attaches to the vice clamp via a threaded machine screw assembly and it has enough threading to allow the coil to turn 360 degrees without becoming detached. This allows the tablet to be swung around a work area in an arch without having to really do anything that requires any effort. While this is great, what really caught my attention is that the clamp itself can be screwed to the coil in two ways at 90-degree angles (top or side) so that the clamp can be attached to an anchored surface that is either horizontal or vertical. This is one of those design decisions that just makes sense but I have seen very few manufacturers make this kind of effort.<br /><br />The coil is covered by a very heavy plastic sleeve which protects the tube and makes flexing the tube easier on the hands.<br /><br />The mounting bracket is connected to the top of the flexible tube by a ball joint, similar to the kind of joints many GPS navigators use in cars to attach to the suction base. When I first attached the bracket to the coil I put it on upside down, which is not a big deal except that the weight of the tablet worked against the joint and it tilted downward slightly. The bracket itself is a standard slider with a lever that presses against the slider which then catches on teeth on the frame to lock it in place. There's a fair bit of padding on the bracket to protect the tablet when it's being clamped in and when the position is being adjusted.<br /><br />This mounting stand is of such heavy construction that it suggests the stand was designed for industrial use. While it is just fine for home use and is not out of place in a professional office, it is a good for a manufacturing assembly line or even a busy retail location.<br /><br />This is a great mounting stand for tablets in 7\"-11\" range. The whole stand is very sturdy and solid and is build to last. Based on my experience with it I can heartily recommend it to any one who needs a mounting solution for a tablet.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.",

            "question": "title: Solid Sound Profile\ntext: The current trend with ear buds is to boost the bass to the point of overpowering the rest of the sound profile. I don’t particularly like bass that is too heavy because it can give me awful headaches. These buds have the bass boosted but it is not over the top.<br /><br />These ear buds are very lightweight and low profile. Smaller than many ear buds I have used they fit in my ears very comfortably. The silicone inserts are soft and do not cause any discomfort, but just as important they create a good seal in the ear canal and as a result they have good passive noise canceling (sound isolation). This is a good sign right out of the package - many ear buds I have tried do not seal properly.<br /><br />The sound profile is the most important aspect of any earphones or ear buds. There are really three areas in the sound profile that merit mention - the highs, the mids and the bass. This set of buds is marketed as heavy bass and that is not completely true. Yes, they do have good bass, but it is not heavily overdriven like most. The bass is a little more front-and-center, not in-your-face, if that makes some sense. The mids are good and the music sounds full as a result, not hollow and depthless. The highs are very bright and clear which is a slight surprise - most ear buds that enhance the bass do so at the expense of the highs, so having a set that had strong bass and highs together is a very nice change of pace.<br /><br />These buds come with a very small carrying case. It is a pinch case and has enough room for just the buds and the replacement silicone inserts. It is a soft plastic case and provides protection only from dirt and moisture (though by no means waterproof) so this is not a case that will help when the buds are crammed in a pocket or backpack.<br /><br />This is a very nice set of ear buds at a very nice asking price. They have a very good sound profile and they are comfortable to wear. Keep these in mind when looking for inexpensive buds and good sound.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

            "question": "title: Nice sport watch, but not sure about blood pressure accuracy.\ntext: The Pard Health Sport Watch has a pedometer (steps taken, distance and calories burned), heart rate monitor (beats per minute), O2 monitor (amount of oxygen in your blood), weather (current temp, high and low temp), messages (must be synced with your smart phone), stopwatch, find feature (locates your phone, in app on phone will locate watch), a blood pressure monitor and an exercise monitor.  The exercise monitor tracks running, cycling, jump roping, table tennis, badminton, tennis and swimming.  The watch is comfortable to wear and looks nice, it has five different watch faces you can choose as your display. I chose this watch because of the blood pressure (bp) monitor, I have high blood pressure and I take medication to keep it normal.  I own two electronic high blood pressure test cuffs and I tested my blood pressure with both of them and the watch and the two cuffs were +/- a point or two apart, but the watch was reading a lot higher than the other monitors.  Throughout the day I repeated the test and the watch was constantly reading that my blood pressure was high, even after I had taken my medication and I know the readings should have changed.  I will have to get with my doctor/nurse and have them do a manual test and see if the watch is showing the same results.  If the watch bp monitor is not accurate, I have not been able to find any way to recalibrate the watch to input the correct bp reading.  That is the only problem I have with this watch.  I like all the features the watch has along with the phone app too.  It doesn't take long to learn all the functions of the watch as well as the app.  If you have high blood pressure, I wouldn't rely on just the watch to monitor your blood pressure because I don't believe it is accurate enough.  Maybe in time there will be an upgrade in the software to fix that. Other than that it is a great sport watch and I am happy with it overall.",

            "question": "title: Decent Entry-Level Bluetooth-Only Headphones\ntext: I have worked with a lot of different headphones, mostly active noise canceling (ANC) phones but also more traditional phones. Over the years I have had several Sennheiser phones and they typically have balanced sound and good build quality. This set is a step down from many of the others with which I have worked, though they’re still decent.<br /><br />My preference on headphones is over-the-ear phones which for me are more comfortable. These particular phones are on-ear, and these pinch a little after extended wear. They’re better than some of the other on-ear phones with which I have worked, but I still prefer over-the-ear phones. One preference I have is a headphone that clamps down fairly tightly when worn so they’re less likely to slip off when I tilt my head down; these are a lighter fit.<br /><br />These are Bluetooth-only phones and as such cannot be used with non-BT devices. This is unfortunate but isn’t a deal-breaker.  These connect easily and quickly.<br /><br />These are not ANC phones, but they have excellent passive noise canceling which is quite surprising for on-ear phones. They reduce ambient noise in my office considerably, which us especially noticeable when running a large fan that I use to generate white noise. I am pleased with that aspect of these phones. These are still not as effective as a set of ANC phones.<br /><br />The sound profile is fairly typical of Sennheiser phones, though the bass is mildly beefed up.. The trend with phones these days is overdriven bass, and these do increase the bass response a little bit but not to a headache-inducing level. The midrange is full and warm, and that’s a good thing as many times the increased bass comes at the expense of the midrange. The highs are bright and clear without being piercing. Overall, the sound is reasonably balanced, but certainly not audiophile quality.<br /><br />Build-wise, these actually feel a bit on the cheaper side which is surprising. These aren’t exactly fragile, but they are definitely not of the same build quality as other Sennheisers I have used in the past.<br /><br />These are probably best described as entry-level headphones. They’re not the highest quality, and they are not the most sturdy, but the sound quality is fine and the cost is right. The main thing I would change is the addition of an audio port so they could be used as wired phones.",

I bought a KDS-60A2000 in January of 2007 so I've had it for a few months over a year. As most of you will recognize, my unit is a 60\" SXRT from the previous model year.<br /><br />Like many of you, I did a lot of Internet research before settling on the Sony - it was very highly rated by a number of sites. The final straw was live viewing many sets side-by-side on the same program from the same source - it was a no-brainer - the Sony had at least as good a picture as any Plasma in the store and the price couldn't be beat.<br /><br />I use Verizon's FIOS fiber optic service and have the unit hooked up through my home theater audio. The picture - indeed the HD experience - is simply awesome - especially live sports - like ice hockey.<br /><br />I did \"tune\" the picture using the DVE (Digital Video Essentials) HD optimization DVD and it remains the sharpest, most accurate picture that I have personally seen (including the high-bucks plasma sets). I've had absolutely no problems of any kind and there have been no regrets on purchasing this set.<br /><br />Another tidbit: I also purchased a Logitech Harmony 880 remote control and am able to control the Sony, the Verizon HD receiver, a Yamaha home theater receiver and a Sony upscaling DVD with a single click. It's programmed via the Logitech Internet site (using a USB connection) and can handle about any peripheral you might have. I've got a bowlful of unused remotes now. It's a little pricey at $150 but it has contributed to my HD enjoyment by simplifying the mechanics.",

A good comparison is those cables are much like an old car - it should get you there, whereas this cable is like a high end sports car - it will get you there lightning fast, without failure.<br /><br />This Cat8 is thicker than some due to the shielding within and additional insulation.  This cable is made to withstand and holdup to exterior environments for the long term. The connector bases are reinforced at each end of the wire which really help hold all of the wires in place even if you have to bend and twist it to fit it within the plug.  The connector plug itself is gold plated which is the ultimate standard in connectivity.<br /><br />This Cat8 Ethernet Cable is 75’ long which makes it absolutely ideal for using it to directly plug your TV or gaming system into your router - even if located in a different room.

            "question": "title: Works Great for Me\ntext: I selected this audio extension cable for the office, where I need to use headphones to listen to content but am unable to move the source. A 6' audio cable is often too short, and having an extension cable instead of a full audio cable enables me to use different headphone sets. So far, this cable has worked out for me.<br /><br />This is a nylon-wrapped cable which I prefer to plastic-insulated cables for durability. Unlike many other nylon cables, though, this one has some flex to it and it is not stiff and prone to knotting or kinking like others I have used. The end connectors are attached with a plastic sleeve that is stiff enough to keep the cable from getting bent at the connector without some effort, and this should greatly help in making this cable last longer since the point of connection is usually the failure point for me with audio cables.<br /><br />The main concern I had when adding this cable to my configuration is if it would work seamlessly or would it introduce static or a hum to output. While this might not be a huge concern in this case it was still something I made a point to check. The sound was identical with this cable in place as it is without it. Even when turning the connector on either end, there was no static. That's all I can really ask of it.<br /><br />This cable meets a need I had and it works very well. It's made nicely and it doesn't impact sound quality, good or bad (unless replacing a bad extension cable). Based on my working with it I am happy to recommend it.",

At first I thought I had to use the Haven subscription, especially after reading the reviews here which said it is necessary. I was kind of bummed about that at first but it turns out this is really useful even without! Sure, being able to record videos and store them in the cloud require a subscription as well as many of the advanced features, but you can still \"arm\" the camera to snap a photo and alert your phone when it detects motion, which it does splendidly even without a sub. The way I currently use it, it alerts my phone and I can then go to the live view and see and even interact with who is there (talk feature is really cool!).<br />On top of that, I set ours up with Amazon's Alexa voice service and it is EXTREMELY COOL! I think the speaker seems a bit louder than an Echo Dot, which surprised me. I'm mounting ours by the front porch so we can see people come to the door and interact with them, but we can also use it to play music via Amazon's Alexa when just sitting on the porch drinking coffee. That's an amazing perk that I wasn't expecting before we got it!<br />I do wish you could combine it with device music groups in Alexa (so I could say, for example, play this song on the everywhere group and it will play inside on our Echo and out on the porch with the Ecobee), but sadly only echo devices can be grouped. That's OK, I knew that before getting this as other devices in our home can't be grouped either (Facebook Portal or Kindles, for example).<br />If you want to spring for the subscription service, there's a TON of goodies and advanced features beyond even the cloud storage things. But even without that, the live view and photo motion alerts combined with the voice assistant / Alexa integration makes it worth it even just for the hardware alone!",

You wouldn't want to get into a position where you lose your phone and it has your only copy of baby pictures for the last 10 years. However, another positive thing is that even if you drop your phone into a lake, you can still fish it out and extract the photos from the card (solid state memory).<br /><br />Very nice product.<br /><br />A couple of the other reviewers mentioned that they purchased this item from secondary sellers and got a knock-off.

I've been using it for a couple of weeks now, and I'm definitely a fan.<br /><br />First, it's very solid with reinforced plugs (both ends).  I've worn out many lightning cables, and the place where they wear out first is where the cord connects to the plug (especially on the lightning end).

I use a shorter cable for my bedside recharging station, but when I travel (especially when I travel), I'm never sure where the outlet will be, and I like to have my phone handy on the nightstand just in case.

            "question": "title: They have software called Sentinel you install on your PC and this is your gateway to all updates and firmware and it can contro\ntext: This review is for the Uniden BCD436HP I see reviews here for other radios, so not to be confused.<br />I used Amazon Prime Now to get the radio to me, in less than 1 hour (about 45 minutes) the delivery person was knocking on my door with my new receiver, wow, I was highly impressed and I will always check to see if Prime Now is available for all my deliveries from now on.....<br />So, the radio....<br />This receiver has a 4 gig SD card preloaded with every known frequency with text for the entire US and Canada. They have software called Sentinel you install on your PC and this is your gateway to all updates and firmware and it can control your radios SD card any way you like. Sentinel has an extensive database of all frequencies and let me say this again, all frequencies have text description included which is the most highly advanced scanner database system I have ever seen and I have owned scanner receivers most of my adult life, (long time)..<br />This is a digital receiver using the latest technology available. It can monitor any analog or digital TX (with some exceptions, like encrypted signals) and gives you extensive control over what you're listening to. There are FCC laws regarding what is legal and not legal to monitor and Uniden has got us right up to the maximum legally allowed to be monitored by civilians. If you are law enforcement persons you will have much more powerful receivers available to you capable of Cell phone conversation monitoring etc., things no civilian should even be interested in.<br />There is another version of this Uniden radio, the BCD536 which is a tabletop version. If you have large powerful outdoor weatherproof antennas the BCD536 is a good option and it is completely transferable to vehicle dash mount and back from your work desk to your vehicle.<br />I like this handheld BCD436 best personally for my purposes.<br />This is basically a plug and play receiver. It comes with 3 2300 milliamp rechargeable batteries, load those, charge them or just leave radio plugged in, enter your zip and you're in. Well theoretically that's how it works, in the real world? No.<br />When you first receive the radio I would suggest positioning yourself in front of your PC. Have the paper manual, the radio, you and your PC right there in front of you. Get ready to read and learn your radios keyboard layout and what these great, well thought out keys can do for you. You will learn, trust me, you will quickly come to love this radio.<br />Some cons:<br />No wall charger adopter included. You can charge from your PC's USB ports but you will need a wall charger with USB port. Most of us have several of these around the house from old cell phones etc. They work fine.<br />This unit should come with a nice wall charger adopter. That's really the only con, not to bad really.<br />Antennas:<br />Your ability to scan and receive signals on any scanner is proportionate to your antennas. The more robust and correct (correct meaning size, materials used etc).. You will need some nice antennas for this nice radio to increase your scanning powers. Amazon has some nice antennas, scannermaster.com has some also. Your local radio shop retailer will have some also. The included rubber ducky antenna is garbage, toss it from across the room to your garbage can, see if you can make a rim shot. Like I said, I have been playing with scanners for many years so I have many antennas to pick from.<br />Verdict:<br />This is without a doubt, the most powerful handheld scanning receiver available from any manufacturer. It is the luxury sedan of the scanning receiver world. It is easy and robust. It is backed up by Uniden's Sentinel software which will future proof your radio for many years to come.<br />I give Uniden 5 stars for this winner.<br />I give Amazon 5 stars for Prime Now 1 hour shipping, also a winner.<br /><br />Edit:<br />Okay some people are wondering what the best accessories are for this receiver.<br />Go to scannermaster.com and look for the Austin Condor All-Band Portable BNC Antenna and the SpectrumForce Desk Mount for One Portable Scanner.<br />The Condor all band antenna is unsurpassed.<br />The desktop stand holds your handheld at the perfect viewing angle, you can listen and see all text clearly right beside your computer.<br />See my photos. The photos ended up sideways.... trying to fix this..... Amazon, can you turn my photos upright?",

I am just going to tell you the truth. I am 70 years old and I purchased these cameras because I live alone and I wanted security. I am not secure and I do not feel secure. I purchased due to all the advertisements and because Shaq endorsed them. They do not work and the customer service really sucks. One day I was put on hold for 45 minutes then hung up on. The supervisors are no help at all. I purchased 3 floodlight cameras and 1 doorbell camera. They all are malfunctioning. The doorbell does not alert until the person is long gone. What is the purpose if the incident is over before you can even see it. Then you cannot even pull the incident up for about 4-5 minutes! You have to wait to see who was at your door and that's not safe. in 4-5 minutes someone could already be in your house!! I have horrible neighbors who are interfering with one of the floodlight cameras and literally making it go off every 1-3 minutes. I've called ring over 52 times since October of 2019. They cannot or will not resolve the issue, other than tell me the camera cannot be tampered with. I KNOW THAT IS NOT CORRECT! If you buy these cameras buy at your own risk. I am here to tell you that they do not work and customer service will not help you when they fail and they will fail!!!! Shame on you Shaq O' Neal. Shame on you Amazon for buying and selling this mess !!!!!!!  On my last recent call to Ring I was told that the cameras do not work in real time. The representatives say whatever they want to try and get you to hang up. I'm 70 not senile. Someone named Richmond told me that! The commercials show the people walking up, you activating the sound and talking to the person. One of My problems is the people are already gone before the camera actually activates. I would look into buying something else if I could afford it. You have a choice. DO NOT BUY RING. Do not be tricked like I was.",

            "question": "title: I am amazed at the sound that these small speakers produce\ntext: Looks like I have the privilege of being the first person to review the BA M25 speakers. I picked up a pair of these on Christmas Eve and have been playing them constantly over the past 2 weeks. My focus has been on 2 channel stereo recordings instead of movies. My set up is through an older Denon AVR 610 receiver that I have had for almost 20 years. I was initially impressed with the smooth, balanced feel of these speakers. Good mid range, nice high end, but not too bright, and a very strong bass response. The M25s defy their size in producing bass tones. Give them some break in time before making a final assessment. These speakers excel at producing music performed on real instruments. The do a great job on jazz, blues and acoustic folk styles of music. Vocals come across nicely as well.<br />Boz Scaggs \"But Beautiful\" CD of standards sounds great. Upright bass, piano and vocals make you feel like you are in a small jazz club. Diana Krall \"Live in Paris\" also plays very well. Nice piano, guitar & vocal reproduction. Jorma Kaukonen's \"Blue Country Heart\" CD showcases some great finger style acoustic guitar. Very natural acoustic guitar tones. Linda Ronstadt's \"Winter Light\" CD has some of the most powerful vocals you will ever hear and the M25s reproduce Linda's voice and backing instrumentation extremely well. The sound is never strained or harsh. Initially, I was a bit more apprehensive on some CDs with lots of bass. They sounded like they were trying to overcompensate on bass, but this has evened out over the past week. Eric Clapton's \"Pilgrim\" CD has come serious bottom end and the M25s produce very deep, tight bass response. Peter Gabriel \"So\" is a similar story. Deep, tight bass response that does not bottom out. Paul Rogers \"Muddy Waters Blues\" is a treat on the M25s. The opening track features some acoustic delta blues guitar, followed by a chorus of female backup singers and later some nice Strat blues guitar tones. It all sounds great on these speakers.<br />The look and finish on the speakers is impressive also. They are finished in a polished black exterior with a leatherette finish on the top, back & bottom. They look like a piece of fine furniture that would fit into a modern style of home décor. These speakers are very expensive though. I got a demo pair at less than half of the $399 per speaker list price. I don't think I would have bought them at full price. I have been listening to Boston Acoustics speakers for over 20 years. I still own a pair of A60s and a pair of A120s that have served me well over the years. The M25s have replaced the A120s as my primary speakers in my living room due to their sonic capabilities and their stylistic good looks.<br /><br />Update 6/24/14 - After listening to these speakers for 6 months, I continue to be even more impressed by the Boston M25s. I bought these thinking they will do until I can find better. While there are better speakers out there, I have concluded, after many demo sessions, that I would need to spend at least $1500-$1800 or more to get some form of improvement over the M25s. Short of stepping up to KEF R300 @ $1800, B&W CM5 @ $1500 or Aperion Verus Towers, the M25s deliver the goods with very balanced & neutral sound, great detail in the upper register and sold bass. Highly recommended.",

Set up was pretty easy and the Recast actually pulled in about 6 channels I never received before--even using the same antenna! 😊 2.  The ability to use Alexa to navigate is nice (although I don't use it) - - especially since the user interface is awful (see below) .  The BAD:  1.  The absolute WORST thing about this is that the Channel Guide is buried and you have to scroll through several menus to actually find it.  AMAZON, IF YOU'RE LISTENING :  MOVE THE CHANNEL GUIDE!  It should be the first thing you see on the home page, or at least put a link up in the top bar where you put everything else (Home, Live, DVR, etc.)  2.  The user interface needs to be streamlined--it is way too busy.  3.  Along those lines, there is no way to delete the apps you don't want on there, so we're stuck navigating through a bunch of stuff we are not interested in and will never watch.  4.  A minor issue probably,  but the channels are listed by name and not number in the Channel Guide, so if you're  used to punching in numbers on a remote, this takes getting used to.  I would prefer it if there was a number pad on the remote to punch in the channel number, but there isn't.  You can tel Alexa to \"tune to channel #___, but I prefer to do this the old-fashioned way.  5.  Even though there are 4 tuners, you can only WATCH on 2 devices at a time.

However, the key is the protection it provides and the folio's flexibility in accommodating right- or left-handed folks.<br /><br />You can change the orientation of the sketch pad and tablet by simply turning the folio upside down, reinserting the sketch pad from that direction, and doing the same with the tablet holder, which is held in place by a magnet. In addition, this offers two different viewing angles as well as a typing angle when the folio is configured as a stand. See my customer-supplied images for details.<br /><br />I love the absolute protection that this folio/tablet holder provides. The holder into which the iPad snaps in is tough and shock resistant, and the folio itself is equally so. This comes with a screen protector to add yet another layer of protection. Of course, with the paper sketch pad covering the face of the iPad when this is closed gives maximum protection to the screen should you accidentally drop it.<br /><br />While the functionality and protective features are outstanding, this folio has looks too. If you like understated elegance this has it. Or it does in my opinion. I love the feel of the exterior, which is akin to a fine suede, but is truly tough.<br /><br />The pad itself can be replaced with 6x9 inch refills. The actual size of the one that ships with the case is slightly undersized, but I did test a standard 6x9 and it fit.",

Wow, less than $20. I just reviewed another usb capture device for $60. I'm not sure it does anything better than this one, except in the looks department. This $20 version even came with a HDMI cable. What? Compared to the other, this is a crazy deal.<br />* Plug and Play for people familiar with these devices. If not, you'll need to learn about capture software. If using this at the PC, then a popular software people use is OBS.<br />* However, there are higher quality capture devices for your desktop. These little usb versions are better fro DSLR camera users who want to create a second monitor screen with their smartphones.<br />* Personally, a fun use case scenario for me, is turning spare phones into mini tvs.<br /><br />USING YOUR SMARTPHONE TIPS:<br />----------------------------------------<br />* The type of USB adapter you use will matter. If your phone has a USB-C port, then you'll need a female USB A to USB-C adapter. If it has a micro usb port, you'll need a female USB-A to micro usb adapter. I found that the ones with a little cord are finicky. A solid one piece, cordless usb to usb-c adapter solved the issue for me. Watch my video to understand what I'm saying.<br />* Many USB Camera Viewer apps won't work. It's not an exact science because you're dealing with so many variables such as app version, phone brand, android version, not to mention your hardware. Some apps gave me video, but no audio, some slam you with so many ads, it's annoying unless you pay. The best paid app is USB CAMERA PRO by Shen Yao, their free version is good too, but has ads. The best free app that virtually has no ads is USB CAMERA VIEWER by Homesoft, LLC. This is the app you see in my video demo. I'm using a Pixel 6 Pro.<br />* If connecting a media device such as fire stick, roku, etc., you will need to bypass HDCP, and you'll have to trial and error with the different types of splitters on the market. The GOXMGO splitter in my video demo worked nicely.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* Well, as mentioned above. I had reviewed another usb capture device that cost $60. The only advantage it has is that there is no dangling cord, and it's a colorful red. In terms of function, I don't see an advantage. At $20, you get the usb capture device and a HDMI cable. This is an amazing deal compared to the other. This product is 5-Stars!",

I don't buy screen protectors without guard frames now.

            "question": "title: Superior to iPod\ntext: I bought a ZuneHD 32GB as a replacement for my iPod Video. I still have the iPod but I don't particularly care for it (never really did) so I decided to search for a better MP3 player. After digging online for a while I decided on the ZuneHD which has proven to be far and away better. It is not a perfect device but it's excellent for my needs.<br /><br />Looking a lot like a small smart phone, the ZuneHD is a sleek and attractive device with a nice touch screen and a brushed metal back. Having never before used one of these I was a little confused at first on how it worked but the learning curve is easy and it took little time to get used to it. It works a lot like a tablet, actually. The screen is very responsive and navigation is simple.<br /><br />I confess that I never used the ear buds. Instead, I use a set of really nice noise-canceling head phones and the sound coming out of the Zune is excellent. My music of choice is usually techno-trance stuff so there is a lot of base and a lot of synthesizer, and by default the sound is well-balanced and clear.<br /><br />So, my main use for an MP3 player is to connect it to my car. My car has voice-controlled everything and I wanted to be able to listen to my music collection in the car without fiddling with the player directly. When I used the iPod I found that the system frequently got confused and the player would often select the wrong song. If it got confused enough, it would hang the voice activation for controlling the MP3 player for weeks at a time, so I gave up and put my Zune in the car instead. So far, the Zune and the car work together nearly flawlessly. As a bonus, the car keeps the Zune charged up.<br /><br />The only drawback I have found with the Zune is that there is no way to expand the storage capacity. It would be nice to have the ability to add a MicroSD card in to expand the capacity.<br /><br />I am exceptionally satisfied with my Zune. I likely will never buy another iPod again, now that I know how much better an MP3 player can be.",

If one was on a budget then I suppose VR goggles you just slide your phone into would give you the same effect as these. These don't take up much space though and would be great for something like an airplane instead of having to have a giant laptop out the whole time and your neighbor judging you for watching a horror movie on the plane. I get bored easily and even a 2 or 3 hour flight could be made so much better by watching a movie so these little glasses are my best friend! You can plug the usb c into your phone and into these and you get instant mirroring without any apps even! I went to some VR videos and you can look up and down and turn around in a room and see all around it- it's really neat!<br /><br />Honestly I don't know the full potential to use these for gaming or whatever but for streaming video, they work great and have a great picture! I've even used them in bed and they light up the room a little less than my phone screen so don't disturb my boyfriend as much.<br /><br />If you're worried about someone seeing what you're watching from the front (they used see thru lenses for some reason)- I suppose you could put some sort of darkening tent or something on the outside and it'd keep people from seeing what you are watching.<br /><br />I was truly blown away at how quickly I got these up and going without having read any instructions or having ever had anything like this previously.

If someone is into the more modern look, then they will be super happy with this frame because the build quality is superb! Frameo is the app that is used for this and it's super easy to use.

I needed a wireless mouse to use with a laptop and this one looked like a good fit. So far I have no complaints, but I do offer one word of caution with it.<br /><br />The most obvious thing about this mouse is the strange appearance. It doesn't resemble any other mouse I have used and at first it looks like it might be uncomfortable on the hands. On the contrary, though, it is quite comfortable and I have had no issues with it being too small for my hands even though it is a typical-sized mouse.<br /><br />I used with with my Windows 10 system and it works just fine. I have not tested it against my Linux system though I have no reason to believe it won't work - every other wireless mouse I have tried has worked without any trouble at all so I expect this one to be no different. If it proves otherwise I will return here and update.<br /><br />I ran into an immediate issue with this mouse - I could not find the receiver and as such I was unable to get it to connect to the system. It does not have any Bluetooth capability so that is not an option. As it turns out, the receiver was packaged in the box but was in a small plastic baggie separate from the mouse and when the box was opened to remove the mouse the receiver fell out, unnoticed. I thought I had been sent a mouse without the receiver until I finally realized what had happened and located the receiver. So, use some caution when taking this mouse out of the box.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with this mouse. It works as expected and is more comfortable than it looks.",

While this works in some settings it is simply not ideal in others.  This mount is outstanding in those situations where you want full motion, including awesome tilt capabilities allowing for elimination of screen glare.<br /><br />We really have put this mount to the test of the limits holding our 75” Sony TV and it has worked perfectly!<br /><br />This is really a well thought out mount.  I had no problem attaching this to my Sony 75” TV and hanging it on our block walls with 16” stud spacing.  As with all TV mounts it is important that you anchor into studs whenever possible or use heavy duty anchoring systems.  Due to using this on a block wall with fur strip studs I utilized a combination of anchors in order to achieve the security I required.<br /><br />This mount not only holds our 75” TV securely but we are able to pull it away from the wall and swivel it so we can see it while working in the kitchen - absolutely incredible!<br /><br />This mount is worth every penny and every second you’ll spend insuring a solid install.<br /><br />This is an outstanding TV mount that I highly recommend.",

I worry so much less when he's driving those strange cities in the late hours knowing he has his Garmin.

            "question": "title: Interesting Gadget, Works as Advertised, But Tied to Smartphone\ntext: This SAMSUNG GEAR S2 SMARTWATCH (Dark Gray) is an interesting gadget, and works as advertised.  It's kind of fun to make and receive telephone calls from your wristwatch (just like Dick Tracy did in the comic strips with his 2-way wrist radio).  However, to be able to make calls, you need to register it with your cellphone network (on Verizon, this entails a $30 activation fee, plus $5 a month thereafter).<br /><br />You can use the Gear S2 for lots of things without activating the phone, of course.  There is a fitness tracker app, and there are interactive watch faces that can keep you abreast of your favorite teams' real-time game scores, the current stock market numbers, and other things.  However, I like my [[ASIN:B00N2BW2PK Fitbit-Charge-Wireless-Activity-Wristband]] much better for telling time and for activity tracking--the Fitbit is easier to use, and does more things reliably.<br /><br />The biggest drawback regarding the apps, is that they are tied to your smartphone.  All of the Gear S2 apps use Bluetooth for running the app from your phone.  This means your smartphone has to be turned on, within the Bluetooth range, and charged, for the apps to work.  One problem that I never solved with the NBA watch face, was that the real-time scoring updates would stop when my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge went into sleep or dormant mode after about an hour.<br /><br />Finally, the Gear needs frequent charging--every day or two.  This means you can't really treat it like a watch that you leave on your wrist 24/7.  You have to treat it like a cellphone, and take it off for charging every night.<br /><br />A negative about activating the phone--boo to Verizon!--is that my assigned phone line had been previously assigned to someone who had a lot of people still looking for him/her.  Thus I got a lot of unwanted calls from the moment the Gear S2 was fully activated.<br /><br />My Gear S2 was free (from a Samsung/Verizon deal with my preorder of the Galaxy S7 Edge).  I'm very glad that I didn't pay a couple of hundred dollars for mine, as it turned out that I have no need for a smartwatch.",

Lots of padding, which is great. Much of the padding in the middle compartment can be taken out if you aren't using it. (Or you can take it out with your stuff inside, should you need said stuff out of the bag, but still want some protection.) It has room for absolutely everything. I do wish there was a little more space in it for, say, snacks or extra drinks. Most of the space is used up in that middle compartment with all the camera and lens padded areas. There is very little room in the largest zippered area, but it is big enough for your laptop, tablet, or e-reader. The front pouch has room for your phone (padded), keys, glasses, pens, etc. There is one drink holder pocket on one side.<br /><br />I like the protection for my expensive stuff.

We are so impressed with how well these work. The images that we view on our cell phones are very clear. Since we have two cameras, it's a split screen on the phone so we can see both cameras at the same time. We have a couple of cats and a dog, so we have turned off the motion sensors for now. We were getting email notifications a little too frequently. The two way sound works as it should - we could see that coming in handy with the pets when we are away. The images aren't live when we first go to the app, but it doesn't take long to get the live images. The pets weren't too happy with the siren feature, but it is a nice feature to have.

These origami cases seem like a good idea.  But if you have them sitting on any kind of slightly slick surface or slightly inclined surface, it won't stand up. The function of the &#34;origami&#34; part is a little complicated, but the pictures help.  Initially it is it very stiff and hard to &#34;fold&#34;.  After a few uses it loosens up which makes setting up the &#34;standing&#34; position a little easier, but it still resists the action and as I mentioned, slips.  I was thinking a little rubber edge all around the case edge would help some.  The case &#34;attaches&#34; to the kindle via magnets and turns your kindle on automatically when you open the case, off when up close it.  On the up side, I definitely prefer the feel of the leather case as opposed to the plastic one.  Sadly neither case really functions as it should for standing. However it will provide some protection for the glass which is a pretty good size now.  In addition to the magnet set in, there is are outer power and volume buttons. They are in good locations and I have not hit them accidently. In fact those buttons are quite handy.<br />I just wish they'd put more thought into actual function and less into &#34;wow this looks cool&#34; on the stand part.<br />Hope this helps some.

I had a middling-quality pair of those \"Inked\" earbuds attached to my laptop at work. The sound quality was always disappointing, but I had sort of assumed that it was probably due to the laptop sound card, etc. Then today I attached my new Sony Fontopias and wow...what a difference! Yes, they have bass boost, but not so much that it overwhelms the music.<br /><br />These headphones are also surprisingly comfortable. They aren't the typical in-ear shape that gets jammed all the way into your ear, but there's a little more to them than the default \"sort of hang in the outer part of your ear\" that you get with the default iPod earbuds, for example. I like the hybrid, in-between quality and they fit me pretty well. They're not noise-cancelling, but the sound is so good that I really don't notice other office sounds (not even my disgusting cubicle neighbor who eats cookies like the Cookie Monster and sounds completely disgusting - now you know why I need to listen to music at work!). I'm so happy with the sound quality and comfort of these headphones, I'm willing to give then four stars in spite of one very major drawback:<br /><br />THE CORD IS RIDICULOUSLY SHORT.<br /><br />I have NEVER seen such a short cord on any pair of headphones, earbuds, headset, etc. that I have owned. I measured the cord from the jack to the point where the \"Y\" that goes to each individual bud starts, and it is barely 2 feet. TWO FEET! People, that is SHORT. So I'm going to go to Radio Shack at lunch today and buy an extension cord/adapter. So unless you're going to sit right next to the source you are connecting the headphones to, whether it's a computer or MP3 player or stereo, you'll need to add the cost of an extension cable to the price.

My emachines E525 (stop laughing) has a known issue that I didn't know about that makes the computer overheat after about 20-30 minutes of viewing video or listening to streaming music.<br /><br />The pad allows me to put the cooling components right over the parts that get the hottest. And both the top and the bottom of the computer stay cool. So far, no overheating and shutting down while watching video!!!<br /><br />Easy to use, didn't have to read the directions, just pressed a button to release the fan from where it was and reposition it, then use the usb to power the fans and we were off. The black &#34;headband&#34; was a little confusing, but the 2 year old likes it. Don't think I'll use it to join the pad and the laptop together.<br /><br />I know I need to get another laptop but this will extend the life of mine for a little while longer.",

Wait until the `power' and `wi-fi' LEDs light up; then press the WPS button on the router (this is the reason it isn't going to work at a motel/hotel). Then I pressed the Range Extender button on the TP Extender the lowest on the front of the device (must do it within 2 minutes). The LED on the TP Extender should go from flashing to solid, showing that WPS connection has succeeded. Done.<br /><br />tips:<br /><br />there are 6 lights on the TP Extender the top two should be green, if they are RED your extender is too far from the router. If it is no color it means you need to reconnect the router and the extender by repeating the steps above.<br /><br />> to minimize wireless interference keep the Range Extender away from cordless phones, Bluetooth devices and Microwave Ovens.<br /><br />> If possible place the TP Extender in open corridors or spacious locations rather than a crowded room.<br /><br />Frankly I have not noticed any difference in our wi-fi but we have a smaller home (1700 sq feet) the router we have is 2 years old and is in one room in the house while I use my 3 year old laptop (Sony Viao series E) in the livingroom 2 rooms away and 2 walls away. I do plan on bringing it with us on vacation where I am hoping that where we do get poor reception (where we have access to a router), we will get a noticeable improvement.<br /><br />The device has a reset option (if the TP Extender doesn't seem to be working): While the Range Extender is plugged into a power outlet, press the RESET button (located next to the ethernet port underneath the TP Extender) with a pen for 1 second. Wait 2 seconds until all the LEDs flash once.<br /><br />*Bonus - The Range Extender's ETHERNET port allows it to function as a wireless adapter for a wired devices (Blu-ray players, game consoles, DVRs and smart TVs) allowing the device to share the wireless network.",

            "question": "title: \"Getting Started in Under 5 Minutes\" Is No Lie!\ntext: The JABRA STEALTH BLUETOOTH HEADSET guide is titled \"Getting Started in Under 5 Minutes\"--and the guide does not lie.  The basic setup took me less than 5 minutes, even though I had zero prior experience using a Bluetooth headset paired with a cellphone.  And in under 15 minutes, I had voice dialing activated (a feature that depends on your phone), so that I could use the headset to place and end calls with voice commands transmitted to my phone (a Samsung Galaxy S4).<br /><br />My Jabra Stealth headset seemed to need a brief charge (a USB/MicroB cable is included) prior to accomplishing a Bluetooth pairing.  However, I may not have been pressing the Answer/End phone call button correctly at first, to activate pairing--the \"button\" is actually a long silver piece with mic holes, that moves up and down when you press the \"Jabra\" marking.  Once the flashing Bluetooth indicator light appeared, my phone found the Jabra headset immediately, paired with it, and connected.  I can also use NFC to quickly connect my phone with the headset.<br /><br />The headset charges completely in about two hours, which gives you about six hours of talk time.  Once it's even partially charged, a pleasant female voice announces how much talk time is available when you turn the headset on.  The headset is so lightweight, it's barely noticeable when you're wearing it.  You do want to experiment a little with the included selection of ear gels and ear hooks, to find the one that fits your ear most comfortably.  You can wear this headset in either the right or left ear.<br /><br />I would recommend visiting the Jabra Stealth web site, to watch a short instructional video, look over the FAQs, and download the Jabra Stealth User Manual (a .pdf file).  The .pdf manual is slightly more complete than the Getting Started guide, and has an additional section on \"Handling Multiple Calls\" (you can place a call on hold).  The FAQs tell you how to set up the Jabra Stealth headset to work with two different mobile devices (but only one device will be able to use voice-activated dialing).<br /><br />I like this headset a lot, and plan to use it for answering calls handsfree when I'm driving. The sound quality is very good.  You have to use the volume controls on your mobile phone, because there are none on the headset itself, but I'm happy enough with that tradeoff in return for such a small, lightweight headset.",

            "question": "title: Inexpensive Way To Extend the Capabilities of a Samsung Camera\ntext: I ordered this lens and filter kit to go with my Samsung NX300 with the intent of expanding the capabilities of the camera without spending a fortune. I looked at several different kits before settling on this one, based on the price. I will admit to being a bit apprehensive about the cost in relation to the number of lenses and filters in the kit (presently this kit sells for less than $35 on Amazon as I write this) but my concern was ill-placed - this is a good kit.<br /><br />I will start off by saying that I am not a professional photographer by any stretch of the imagination. I could be best described as an enthusiast who is trying to learn as I go.<br /><br />I have experimented and played with many of the various components with this kit, starting with the 2.2x telephoto lens. This is a chunky item, which should be expected as it is a glass lens. It attached without issue to my 18mm-55mm OIS lens and I was able to use it almost immediately out of the box. It took me a little fiddling at first to get the focus just right as I am still learning with the camera but once I figured out the manual focus I was able to improve the zoom range with the telephoto lens in place. This, to me, is worth the cost of the kit. One thing I did notice, however, is that when the telescoping zoom is not fully extended on the regular lens, this lens adds a shadowy blackout area around the perimeter of the image that fades when the zoom is telescoped out.<br /><br />My favorite component of this kit is the .43x wide-angle lens which works surprisingly well with the camera's included lens. It is another chunky item like the telephoto lens and it attaches easily as well. Even at closer ranges (15 feet or so) it allows the camera to capture appreciably more than the regular lens, without distortion. This is probably the one component I will use more than the others, and again this is an accessory that is worth the cost of the kit. This lens is not going to give the same quality result as a dedicated wide-angle lens but the price/quality tradeoff is worth it.<br /><br />There are four close-up lenses in this kit that vary in strength. These are fun to play with though I did start to get a lot of edge distortion when using the strongest lens. This is not a problem as there are times when this kind of distortion is a good thing. I was able to get similar close-up shots - without distortion - with the Samsung lens but it required a lot more effort. Interestingly, one of these lenses had a smudge on it when I removed it from it's cellophane envelope. A quick wipe with a microfiber cloth did a fine job of cleaning the lens but this puzzled me - why was it smudged?<br /><br />The wide-angle lens comes coupled with a macro lens that is absolutely astounding for close-up shots. I use this lens for taking pictures of pattern weaves, close-ups of surfaces, animal fur and other interesting subjects (the knee of my denim jeans makes a really interesting background shot). It works even a little better than the close-up lenses and is likely going to be the only lens I use for when I need a really detailed close-in shot of something. Though this lens outperforms the close-up magnifying lenses it requires decoupling from the wide-angle lens before it can be used and this is a minor hassle.<br /><br />The kit includes a UV filter, a CPL filter and a FL-D filter. I used the CPL filter while experimenting and the result was minorly disappointing but I figured that was due to unrealistic expectations. It did tweak the color profile just a little but not dramatically like I had hoped. The FL-D filter was another story and gave the whole picture a completely different color profile. It is designed for use with fluorescent lighting (which means it should be used a lot when indoors) so when it is used with incandescent lighting it give a very eerie and unusual hue to pictures. With my lens I can adjust for fluorescent lighting electronically so this isn't a lens I necessarily need but I still like to mess with it. I have not tried the UV filter.<br /><br />The cleaning kit is an important item in the kit, for removing dirt and smudges from the various lenses without using a harsh cloth. It's very basic but is a fine start - cleaning spray, cotton swabs, a microfiber cloth and a squeeze duster for puffing away particles when a full cleaning is not needed.<br /><br />This kit includes a couple of other miscellaneous items as well, including a miniature tripod for a desk mount and a 6-compartment memory card storage case. These are nice-to-have extras, though I confess I am thoroughly unimpressed with the tripod which is a flexible bendy-leg tripod that does not retain the position in which it is set when supporting the camera, so it really is of little use. I continue to mess with the tripod, though, as I am sure I can get it to work in certain scenarios.<br /><br />The main negative I encountered so far was actually the manner in which the kit was packaged and shipped to me. Everything was in a large plastic envelope bag with no padding at all. What would prevent the items in the kit from being crushed in such a shipment? Fortunately, all items were individually wrapped in small and sturdy cardboard boxes and one of those boxes was actually slightly crushed though there was no damage to the merchandise inside. Something like this should be shipped in a larger corrugated box, to better protect everything.<br /><br />If you have a Samsung camera for which this kit is compatible, this is a very good kit to extend the capability of the camera without breaking the bank. The various lenses add range and effects, the filters are nice to have on hand and the extras are icing on the cake. At the current pricing, this is a very good deal.",

It's easily height adjustable, it can pivot, the angle can be tilted up and down, it has built-in speakers (I am using a Bose Solo 5 soundbar instead of the built-in speakers), the side and top bezels are not too wide, and the picture quality is very good, with a lot of picture configuration options. (I plugged a 3.5mm stereo patch cable from the back of the monitor into the soundbar.)<br /><br />I watch TV broadcast and cable channels, movies, and TV shows via my computer, so I wanted a larger high quality-picture monitor with a higher DPI capability. I did not want to spend so much and buy one of the many monitors above $500, but I did not want one of the cheaper 32-inchers that had less DPI capability.<br /><br />This LG has so far satisfied what I want. I have settled on the \"HDR Effect\" Picture Setting for most use, and it is quite nice. There is also a  \"Custom\" picture setting that allows for a lot of configuration. (I could never have just settled for LG's factory default picture settings.)<br /><br />The monitor is very heavy...much heavier in weight than I expected. Attaching the stand is really easy. Detaching the stand is also very easy. Build quality of this monitor seems good. Assuming this just-released monitor stays working perfectly for a long time, LG did an excellent job and I am glad I bought it.",

            "question": "title: Installation is easy; sound is crisp, headset is adjustable; ear muffs are cushiony but are tight around the head\ntext: I ordered this as a replacement for the Plantronics headsets that my company provides. I assume the firm I work for buys a cheaper version of Plantronics because they are always breaking after a couple of weeks or months of daily use. Usually, the problem I have with them is that the left earpiece no longer works.<br /><br />Therefore, I decided to try this one. I've only been using this a week on a Dell Latitude E7470 Ultrabook and I really like them. Installation was easy. All I had to do was plug it into the USB port and the system (Windows 7 Enterprise edition) recognized it. I didn't need to follow the instructions provided. The sound is crisp, the ear muff portion keeps external noise to a minimum, and people hear me well on it. I only received two comments. One morning my boyfriend said he heard a slight echo in the background. At one meeting, the attendees said my voice blanked out for a few seconds. However, I don't believe it is the headset because since I got a new computer I was having this same problem with the Plantronics and that problem was worse. With the Plantronics headset, the voice would blank out entirely and would not come back. I actually had to disconnect the headset, reconnect it, and re-dial my call. With this headset, I did not have to do that. I've since moved the headset to another USB port on the same computer and have not been having any problems. Only time will tell how well this headset holds up. Right now I'm using it all day long over 8 hours a day.<br /><br />I would have rated this five stars except that it is a bit tight. That takes some getting use to. If I had a larger head I would get a headache. The headset is adjustable up and down but that did nothing to loose the grip the ear muffs have around the head.<br /><br />So far I love the performance of this unit. Since it takes a while before problems develop with USB headsets, I will update this review if I have any issues. If I get a full year's use out of these without a problem, then I feel it's worth it. At the listed price of $21.95, I would buy this at its current performance level.<br /><br />UPDATE Feb 25, 2017 - I've been using this headset about 8-10 hours per day and it's performing wonderfully. They are so much better than the Plantronics headsets I was using previously.<br /><br />UPDATE August 8, 2017 - This headset is still going strong at 8-10 hours per day. The headset no longer feels tight on as it did in the beginning. This will be my last post unless the headset breaks.<br /><br />UPDATE October 20, 2017- This headset has finally failed with colleagues telling me my voice is spotty. I can still hear others beautifully but cannot carry on a conversation because they cannot hear me. This is now headed for the garbage. It lasted eight months, which is longer than any other headset I have had.",

            "question": "title: Wall cord cover D Line\ntext: If I could rate this 10 stars, I probably would... of course, time will be the true test!  I had some really ugly black cable cords just sitting along the floor.  Ugly to say the least.  So, I thought I would try these.  I just installed this along my base board (looks like quarter round) and it PERFECTLY holds and hides the cords.  I have two cable lines and a very small, flat land line cord in it... plenty of room for another cable if necessary.  There are no instructions.. but it's pretty easy.  There is a clear film on the outside/front - the back is a the self stick.  I was placing it on a painted, non textured wall - so it's very flat and the perfect material for this use.  A couple of things I learned as I was placing it... it worked best for me to cord up the holder before sticking to the wall - IMPORTANT - the sticky back is SOLID - NO repositioning at all. You want to make sure you have shoved up against the last one you placed as tightly as possible - you will still see the seam between each length - but less so if you carefully, firmly place each piece. Before removing the sticky back I \"placed\" it in position to see if I liked it and it would work.  Good thing, because once you remove the sticky back, it is NOT coming off without the sheet rock in torn pieces... just fyi.  I chose to position the opening part of the D tube facing up to make it easier to put another cord in or take one out... personal choice.  The ad says it is paintable and that is what I will try next.  Having said that, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful - and I am eager to see if this will stand the test of time and use.. meaning.. cords pulled, etc.  I see no reason why you couldn't use this going up a wall (thinking of TV that has been hung on wall, etc - personal taste - but remember, the sticky tape is solid and won't be removed without tearing/damaging paint.  As for textured surfaces - like wall texture, I am thinking that as positive as this sticky tape is, as long as it's not too textured, it should work - but to be honest, I have not tried it on a textured surface.  As with most things that use a form of sticky tape, the smoother the surface, the better it will stick.)  I hope this info was helpful to you!",

            "question": "title: slim profile, smooth tracking, plug & play connection, can charge & use at same time\ntext: Slick, small. The main aspect that I like about this is not having to change the batteries. It seems to hold a charge for quite some time (I have been using it nightly for a couple of weeks straight out from box; have yet to actually charge it). I use it entirely with my lap top because I can't stand using the touch pad. So I always use a corded mouse or a cordless mouse. Usually the batteries last a good while, but it is extra nice to not even have to worry about them. When it comes time to charge I can still use it AND charge it by using the USB charging cable.<br /><br />When not in use, the dongle is stored on bottom of mouse. It has a little magnetic port that it slides into.<br /><br />Overall, it works perfectly fine. Smooth-- I use a colorful mouse pad most of the time, but sometimes solid black.<br />Can change DPI, so that will make a difference in smoothness and tracking. \"Featuring 5 adjustable DPI (2400/2000/1600/1200/800)\"<br /><br />What I don't care for, and this is entirely a personal preference, is that it is very sleek and flat. I am used to a beefier mouse-- both a cordless for my lap top as well as a corded for my desktop. I am used to that hump in the middle, and this is rather flat. I don't have huge hands, but I have wide hands. So for short term use it is fine. For longer term use, it could be tiring on the hand. Since I use it with my laptop, and I usually only use it for a little while before bed to check out the internet or play a silly game, it is ok. But for more intensive activities, especially gaming- I need a mouse that fits MY hand better.<br /><br />I do like it though for my short term use. Again, I really like that it is a rechargeable mouse. That is the selling point for me. So if you are ok with a slim profile mouse, this should be just fine for your needs. If you are used to a beefier mouse with that hump in the middle, you may not care for this for long term use.",

Over that time the industry has seen major advances which has led to incredible availability of high quality cameras at very reasonable costs.<br /><br />I had no problem setting this camera up on my network.  I set it up vis Ethernet cable and WiFi and each time it connected without any issue.<br /><br />Due to security precautions I never use cloud based storage in relation to WiFi cameras because that amount of constant data transfer opens your network to unnecessary hacking.  The only cameras that I employ in my home allow for local storage - whether to a dedicated hard drive / served or individual micro SD  held within each camera.  This camera can hold up to a 128 Gb micro SD card.  The card will over write the oldest data first - how much the card holds is dictated by the settings you select.<br /><br />It’s important to know that by default the camera is set to record and save to the cloud.  That can easily be reset in preference settings.<br /><br />The camera provides a crystal clear 1080p image.  I found little to no lag with my mesh WiFi network - typically camera lag has to do with individual network properties rather than the camera itself.  As with the vast majority of outdoor cameras pan and tilt controls are not possible with this camera as it has a fixed lens.<br /><br />This camera has a built in microphone and speaker allowing for 2 way communication making it ideal for placement at home entrances.  In addition it has motion detection and an alarm function that can be set when you are away.  If motion is detected you can have it set to alert your phone, record and / or record the action.<br /><br />I found all of the controls intuitive and easy to control.  The app is well designed allowing for the installation of multiple cameras and easy switching between multiple camera views.<br /><br />In my tests I found this to be an excellent budget friendly WiFi camera that as long as you utilize the micro SD card feature is quite secure.<br /><br />This is a camera I would recommend.",

            "question": "title: Voice calling is bordering on unsuable\ntext: I'm very conflicted writing this review. As music listening and noise cancellation devices, they are wonderful! You can wear this in a noisy environment and get lost in your own tunes or just hear yourself think. Also, it has a similar functional design as Air Pods that allows air in to make it comfortable to wear without the vacuum \"under water\" seal effect that other ear buds have. So out of the box, color me impressed- comfortable and sounds great, what could be better, right?<br />Well, the reason I wanted to try Jabra over other brands is their commitment to call quality. Back in the early days of Bluetooth, Jabra was one of the kings if you wanted to ensure a clear 2-way conversation on a call. A lot of portable audio devices these days overlook mic quality and put all their effort into music / playback, with Apple, Sony, and some other big brands being the exception.<br />Sadly, these Jabras don't seem to deliver in that regard. People we call constantly complain they can't hear us, that we sound far away, under water or over-compressed / missing parts of our voice. In quiet environments it seems to work ok, but maybe the noise cancellation bit is working overtime? I don't know. All I know is I'm so disappointed with the call quality, I can't rely on these if I want the other party to hear me clearly. Yes, the ANC is awesome. Yes, the music sounds good. Yes they are comfortable. But if you need to switch to another headset to make a phone call, these are silly. I really wish it wasn't so.",

This will definitely protect your important investments.<br /><br />The only thing I wish was different was the outlets should be spaced a bit further apart to allow for larger power blocks - the top 2 outlets are separated though the others are not. So many plugs are nonstandard and end up blocking surrounding outlets.  The only thing that would make this product better would be if the outlets rotated which would make them far more adaptable to oddly sized plugs.<br /><br />The 4 USB ports are definitely a nice addition as this helps avoid having to use plugs for USB powered devices.  What is even better about this particular surge protector is 3 of the USB-A ports are 3.0 (which charge far faster than previous versions) and the 4th port is a USB-C (the fastest of them all).<br /><br />This is an outstanding surge protector that has proven itself through my extensive use and testing.<br /><br />This is definitely a surge protector I recommend.",

Since I use a stylus (and my other cases do not have that feature, nor a look for holding one), this quickly became my favorite case.<br /><br />Unfortunately I use my tablet flat on a table, desk or across my lap, so I cannot vouch for the ergonomics of the stand feature.  Also, do read the instructions.

I appreciate that this camera doesn't require too many steps for any action. I've dropped many many times and its still perfect. I love how easy it is to transfer to my phone for Instagram (that as my main goal).  Sometimes i have to climb, or run...so its important to me to be able to shove it into a pocket.

            "question": "title: Recordings Are Stored in Canary Cloud; Full Replay Access Requires Paid Membership\ntext: When I ordered this CANARY VIEW INDOOR 1080p HD SECURITY CAMERA (with Wide-Angle Lens, Motion/Person Alerts, Works with Alexa, Pets/Elder/Baby Monitoring), there was one very important thing that I didn’t understand.  To wit, the camera has zero internal storage--everything is uploaded to Canary Cloud, which costs $89 a year for full-featured camera access and video replays.<br /><br />It is possible to set up the camera without signing up for a free 30-day trial membership (which requires entering a credit card that will automatically be charged after 30 days unless you cancel the membership).  You do this by accepting the $0.00 monthly charge option, and scrolling on down past the place where you enter the credit card info.<br /><br />However, most of the playback and customizing features in the Canary app (the only way to access the camera) are inoperable without a membership.  When you’re at home, you can “Watch Live” if you tinker with the available settings.  However, you can’t play back motion events without a membership unless they happen while you’re away--and you can’t trick the camera into thinking you’re away, because the app determines your location by the location of your tablet or smartphone.  (And you can’t turn the phone off, because you need the app to access the camera.)<br /><br />The camera sells for about $80 on Amazon, and that’s a lot to pay for a device that’s almost useless unless you add a “membership” that costs another $89 a year.  Should the company go out of business, your device will, too.  Also, all of your recordings are stored in Canary Cloud, so you need to trust the company to keep the site secure and private.<br /><br />As for the camera itself, it’s fairly low resolution, but reasonably wide-angle.  Without the membership, the camera will works as a real-time spy camera for the room it’s in (it does resemble an Amazon Echo).  The camera is fixed in one position, and only records what is directly in front, so you need to place it in a spot where it will cover as much area as possible.<br /><br />When I think about it, I don’t really need an indoor security camera, because my Comcast home security system monitors all the doors and windows of my condo.  Given that this device costs $89 a year, it makes more sense for me to add another camera to my existing system ($95) and then accept the extra Comcast monthly charge, so that I don’t have to fool with the awkward Canary app settings.",

The \"plush\" side (loopy, like a washcloth) removes greasy fingerprints quickly, and the \"silk\" (microfiber) side polishes to finish the job.<br /><br />The Smart Cloth works fine with screen protector film (all my touchscreen devices have film).  It is much easier to handle than a thin, slippery, microfiber square.  Also, the cloth's plush side does an excellent job of absorbing skin oil (unlike my microfiber cloths for cleaning eyeglasses that quickly acquire an oily coating and need frequent washing).<br /><br />Additional nice features are:  (1) the Aegis Microbe Shield® protection, which helps protect the cloth against mold and mildew; and (2) the fact that the cloth is stain and wrinkle resistant and machine washable.  The cloth comes in a clear plastic storage bag that has a nice zipper closure.<br /><br />The microfiber side of the Smart Cloth comes in a wide assortment of prints:  flags, bubble dots, stripes, jacquards, flowers, etc.  This beautiful design, Aizuri, is my personal favorite, but there are quite a few other prints that I like almost as well.",

There's a padded lower compartment with customizable Velcro edged dividers for camera and lenses, a drawstring upper compartment for your what-nots that can be converted to one big compartment with the lower one; five smaller external zippered or Velcro-closing compartments; two pull-out side pouches for water bottles or tripod; a rain cover, and a lot of hooks, straps and loops for attaching gear outside of the bag.<br /><br />2. The bottom compartment can easily hold a DSLR camera with two or three lenses, or one lens and a flash, or a combination thereof.<br /><br />3. Smaller pockets have zips &/or Velcro closures for securing lens cleaners, filters, diffusers, spare batteries, chargers, memory cards, remotes or shutter cables etc.<br /><br />4. Sturdy construction and nicely padded adjustable straps.<br /><br />5. Cool National Geographic logo to give the impression that you may actually have something to do with the magazine.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1. It's a big bag to lug around, especially if you're not built like a rugby player.<br /><br />2. Even though it's a big bag, and has many pockets, it's still not ideal as a carry-on travel bag, as the upper drawstring compartment is too small to hold a change of clothes and toiletries, and the sideways slit pocket is awkwardly designed to fit a full-sized laptop.<br /><br />3. It's not possible (or very difficult) to whip out the camera at short notice without taking off the backpack.<br /><br />4. Too many external loops and fasteners add to the weight.<br /><br />5. You may have a hard time remembering which pocket you put specific items in.<br /><br />I use this bag for events or outdoor shoots where I may need more than the basic equipment.  For daily use, the [[ASIN:B000YIWNUS Lowepro Fastpack 100 (Red)]]is much more convenient to fetch around.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, December 28, 2011",

A surge strip is ideal because it not only serves as an extension cord, it also helps protect valuable electronics from harm. And a good tool for the task is Tripp Lite 6 Outlet Desk Clamp Surge Protector Power Strip.<br /><br />With this power strip, you get six traditional style outlets and two USB ports, perfect for charging your cell phones. There is an on/off switch and an indicator light that confirms the surge protection is working. This latter feature is one you don’t normally see with other power strips and it provides added peace of mind.<br /><br />This power strip is u- shaped and comes with a clamp so it can be attached to a desk. The clamp won’t work on just any desk, as I learned, because some desks are too thin. You need a thick spot to clamp. And keep in mind that the clamp isn’t super strong. It can still slip a little but this shouldn’t be an issue in most instances.<br /><br />UL listed and with a long cord, the Tripp Lite 6 Outlet Desk Clamp Surge Protector Power Strip is practical and useful for most home office needs.

I have never had to worry about them being cheaply made or breaking down. This drive continues that tradition.<br />It is ruggedly made, with a great looking case, as far as external drives go. The touchscreen that you use to access the drive is large and accurate to the touch. The USB acts as the power source, so you don't see anything on the screen until it is plugged in.<br />Setup was easy: Plug it in and let the drivers load, set a 6 digit PIN. You can setup additional passwords and security features, or emergency wipe protocol!<br />Security is 256bit, which is the limit you'd need to combat brute force attacks. I don't foresee having anything that someone is going to want to hack, but I am very glad that my documents and pictures are secure, just in case. I am sure there are more features on this device that I will never even use, but they are there if you have a need for even more security than I do.",

By that I mean that that other USB 3.0 cables that I have tried with the phone would charge it, but would not support full speed data transfers and synching. This one performed  without issues and identically to my OEM Samsung cable that came with my phone.<br /><br />The blue outer jacket is much thicker than the Samsung cable. Although it is slightly stiffer it's also pliable and easy to bend and coil. Part of the reason for the extra thickness is probably from the the foil and braid shielding. In fact, the shielding is one factor in this cable's ability to transmit data at such high speeds without error. Another factor is the gold plated connectors.<br /><br />The bottom line is this cable seems to be the equal of the more expensive Samsung OEM cable. In my experience anyway.

Here are some things to consider...<br /><br />1. You can't be handsfree like a microscope, unless you set up your phone with a mini tripod and stuff.<br />2. It's advertised for kids, but I don't think so, not if they're under 10. My children were very interested, but I had to do all the holding and focusing.<br />3. Most likely you'll need to take off your phone case for the lens to stick to your camera lens, especially if the case rises above the phone lens. With the case I'm using, there is a very slight rise, almost imperceptible, yet the microscope lens won't stick to my phone because it's sitting on top of part of the case.<br />4. The lens stick to your phone via some sort of suction/sticky pad. After awhile, it will no longer stick. However, the manual has a solution that did work. You simply use clear tape to clean the dirt off the lens as well as the lens on your phone. It's like when you're putting on a screen protector for you phone, and they provide you with stickers to pick up the dust. Same thing here.. you're using tape to pick up the dust. It actually works. My lens was able to stick again to my phone.<br /><br />All in all, it's nifty, it's something you're curious about, but after going through with it. I'm 100% sure we won't be using it much. We have a dedicated microscope at home for the kids, and to me, that's still much more convenient. I don't want to take off my phone case, focus the camera for the kids, etc. If you're buying this for yourself.. go for it! If you're buying this, thinking you'll be using it a lot to keep your kids busy, think again. Because it'll end up keeping you busy. LOL!<br /><br />I'll rate this 4-Stars.",

I couldn't get all of the inputs to work.\ntext: The biggest difference between this projector & the much more expensive projectors in professional settings is the bulb. This one does a fine job in low light or with back light but will completely wash out with light around or over the screen. I ordered this primarily to do presentations & show videos at my club meetings. It performed well but we did have to fiddle a bit with the lights in the room & the position of the projector.<br /><br />The usefulness of this projector is its portability & low cost. It is lightweight & compact & fairly easy to set up. I would have appreciated a padded carry case for the projector but the box it comes in works pretty well. It has foam that surrounds the projector, it holds all the cords, it has a handle & it is easily sturdy enough to set the projector on for more height.<br /><br />It helps a lot with the focus & clarity if the projector is nearly horizontal. That means that if the projection screen is to be 4' over the ground then the projector also needs to be 4' off the ground which is generally going to be much higher than a table. The focus ring around the lens works very well to dial in the clarity. There is a foot that unscrews from the bottom front to angle the projector up. I tried propping something under the front to angle it higher but the image distorts & loses clarity the more it is tilted.<br /><br />The biggest issue I have had with the projector is the image source. I can't get either of my laptop computers to recognize the projector as an external screen with the HDMI cable but the HDMI works on a DVD player. The IOS control works pretty well with my iPad. My Pixel phone doesn't support the built-in Miracast. The Bluetooth only recognizes my Samsung TV & none of my phones, computers or tablets sees the projector's Bluetooth signal. It has a YouTube app built into the device software but it is un-useable due to a cumbersome search process that doesn't return any results. I ended up using it with a USB thumb drive which works well & the menu is easy enough to navigate but takes some learning. I did not try the AV cable inputs or the SD memory slot.",

I had planned on cobbling together a 3D printing channel on YouTube but some of the functionality of this is so disappointing. The zoom especially is the worst. It's stepped. There's no smooth zooming in and out, something every still camera I have with video capability can do. How ridiculous is that? You set up a shot and then go to zoom in on the piece you're printing and it zooms, then stops, then zooms, then stops, and does exactly the same zooming out. Video quality is mediocre. Menus are hard to navigate even with the touch screen. The 'night vision' capability is cute and works for a short distance but the quality is horrible. Still images are no better and possibly worse than the video. The wide angle/macro lens is seriously heavy. It does work but there's few elements and the glass is cheap. Macro shots are unimpressive. . , the same description covers just about everything. The external microphone doesn't sound much better than the onboard mic. This might be okay for a kid. Someone just starting out to see if they want to make videos. I'm not really sure who could or would want a camera that's mediocre on all fronts. Nothing stands out as impressive.",

            "question": "title: Well made, great price\ntext: Reading some of the reviews, there have obviously been some issues with this item that I believe where another case being sent instead. Looking today at the Amazon listing, there is something wrong because the &#34;Product Description&#34; is obviously for something else. I reported it.<br /><br />All I can say is the item picture and the details are correct. I got what I was looking for and it is great for the price. Nice and roomy, very secure with an adustable padded divider that you can move where you want it. Fits my Fuji S series camera with room to spare. You can easily put a couple extra sets of batteries, communication cables or other items and not be crowded. Pretty well made and I like the flap that covers the zipper area. They don't call it weather proof, but I think it would hold up to some rain or snow and keep things dry inside.<br /><br />Being a camera nut I have tried all kinds of cases from exact fit, hard cases, soft cases and big camera bags. This is a nice size. Not too big and not too small. I've already used it for some of my other cameras too. Main things I'm looking for is protection from dust, dirt, a surprise rain or a little snow, and some moderate protection from bangs and &#34;bruises&#34;, and a bit of room for appropriate accessories. This case fits those need quite well. At ~$8 it's hard to imagine finding anything better for that low a price. If you have a Fuji S series or any other similar sized camera, you won't be disappointed.",

            "question": "title: A very nice keyboard with many connection options.\ntext: Typically I stick to higher end gaming keyboards.  Mechanical and optical switches are generally my go to.  I had never used a keyboard from this brand before so when I was given the chance to grab one, I figured I would see how it stacks up.<br /><br />So far I'm fairly impressed.  I've used some tournament edition keyboards with the smaller form factor from other brands so I knew what I was getting into when it came to the size of the keyboard.  All in all, sizing is fine.  They key placement and distance between keys works fine.  I do run into issues at times where my fingers get lost on the right side of the keyboard.  Getting used to that will come in time though.  The key response is quick.  They are mechanical switches but they do manage to deaden the sound a bit which is nice.  The RGB features are basic at best.  You have a few settings you can select from and all of it is done directly on the keyboard itself.  It has your normal basic modes.  It illuminates well though and you can increase/decrease the brightness.  The build quality is nice.  For being a 75% keyboard, it has some weight to it.  I like the fact the keys are labeled for both Mac and PC.  I primarily use it on my PC though.  The place where it seems to shine is in the connectivity department.  I can connect it by bluetooth to numerous devices or I can have it wired.  I generally run wired to my main PC and if I need to use it on my MacBook or other devices, I just unplug it from the PC and connect by BT to the other device.  It works out nicely.<br /><br />From a gaming standpoint (which I do a lot of), I'm not certain that I like it as much yet.  Emphasis on the \"yet\".  I know it takes some time to become accustomed to a new keyboard.  The response and feel.  I'm going to continue gaming on it for a while to see if I become more adapted to it.  It just feels different than what I'm used to.  It most likely has to do with the key spacing more so than anything else.<br /><br />This is definitely a nice keyboard and I recommend it.  I will most likely continue to use it as my daily keyboard for a while longer to see how it holds up over time.",

            "question": "title: Lovely little smartwatch, would make a great gift\ntext: There are a lot of things I like about this smartwatch. The face is smaller than other smartwatches I've looked at and tried, about 1.09\" which is perfect for me. Bigger faces like many smartwatches out there are uncomfortable for me to wear, especially when I'm trying to sleep. The design of the watch is really pretty, and I like how the neutral color goes with many outfits. One thing I do wish is that the watchband was changeable so that I could change it if the band wore out or broke (or if I wanted a different style). Most of the smartwatches with changeable bands are those with the large face, a little disappointing. Battery power is good. I use the smartwatch quite often so I tend to hook it up to the battery charger twice a week. I like how I could choose from a variety of screen displays to fit what my preferences are.<br /><br />The app this smartwatch uses is great, the Da Fit app. It's super easy to use, you don't have to use Bluetooth to find the watch, you just use the app to find it. I like how it has a variety of physical activity you can choose to monitor, jogging, biking, walking, etc. The sleep feature is pretty good, the biggest detractor is that it only follows typical sleeping hours. It won't work for anyone who sleeps different hours due to working night shift. Hopefully they'll update that in the app someday. The blood pressure feature seems to be pretty accurate to what the doctor tells me my blood pressure is.<br /><br />Since I really don't want to put out the money for the brand name smartwatches, I am very pleased that I can still enjoy quite a few of the features for a more reasonable price. I'd recommend this watch and it would make a great gift.<br /><br />Update- After a couple weeks of use, the on/off button on the side of the watch popped off and a spring came out. It's so tiny I'm unable to find it. I wasn't using it excessively, so I'm disappointed that something on the watch would break within weeks of use. It's a really nice watch, and they have great customer care so hopefully my issue is not a common problem.",

            "question": "title: Beautiful picture, tiny eye for the remote control to aim at, works with Denon sound bar & wifi\ntext: I bought this television (I double checked the exact model number to be positive that t I am reviewing the correct one) used at an estate sale in January and it's been used daily in our master bedroom every since. The color and clarity of the picture is simply wonderful. In comparison to our brand new Sceptre 55&#34; 1080p tv in the living room and the 3 year old Samsung in the guest room, this Vizio has the prettiest picture and best refresh rate. The Samsung has the best native sound though without a sound bar enhancement.<br /><br />This Vizio is our only Smart Television and I have a Firestick on the living room tv. As of today, June 16, 2016, the Amazon app and others are all working just fine through the television's remote control with the direct access buttons. Connecting this tv to our wifi network did take several attempts and I had to update the firmware twice before it would connect and hold the connection for more than 48 hours. (To be honest, I have no idea if the former owner every actually used the internet connection so it may not have been updated before I got it) Since January, I have had no trouble with the connection or streaming. We do have a super fast internet service and a dual band router with this tv as the only thing typically streaming on one band.<br /><br />My one star deduction is the tiny receiver area for the remote control. If you are using the actual remote rather than a universal one for the cable box, you have to aim directly at the very tiny eye in the far left bottom corner and it can take a couple of tries to hit it just right from across a big room. This drives me nuts when I'm streaming from Amazon Prime and need to pause the show quickly or try to flick through the selections. However, I would totally buy another Vizio tv again in the future if the new ones are as good as this two year old used one has been - I've definitely gotten my hundred fifty dollars worth out of this one.",

It's also the perfect desktop for any business with a marketing department. I watched this video and was totally hooked. I have been doing PowerPoint presentations for 24 years and this blows it out of the water.<br /><br />What finally hooked me to it's creative potential at the office was watching two 3 minute videos on YouTube:<br />&#34;HP Sprout Review&#34; and &#34;Using the Capture Feature on Sprout by HP&#34; - amazing<br /><br />Hook up was easy as I expected about 20 minutes to unbox everything and less than an hour to get everything running<br /><br />Now, right now I am not in a financial picture to buy the 3D printer or imaging stand (even tho the prices are not outrageous),but I can still get a designed printed by establishing a free account with HP's 3D printing partner. FYI the Dremel is the highest rated model by '3D Engineer' just go to their sight and search &#34;dremel-idea-builder-review&#34; it gave me a lot of easily understandable information if I decide to go that route. You can also go to the Dremel site '3dprinter dot dremel' the videos there helped me learn a lot about how this 3D printing works. Lastly, I read a informational article at 'makezine' that you can find on the internet &#34;dremel-3d-printer-idea-builder&#34;.<br /><br />Ok, so the next stop on my journey of discovery was HP where I searched 'Sprout'. So I watched the videos and skimmed the tech stuff. WELL worth your time - I truly think it saved me a TON of time. If object design is your thing or you are looking to get your high school or college kid into computer design this desk top will hook them. It's just so creative! One tip when getting started, on the HP site I put a query of &#34;Sprout&#34; in the search engine and got a nice small list of use links PLUS a dedicated SPROUT FORUM for users where HP folks jump in all the time with helpful information and trouble shooting help.<br /><br />Ok, I really wanted to so how the 3D works so I created a free account with the HP 3D printer partner Sculpteo - it could not be easier. First stop for me was searching the Sculpteo site for '3D Printing Price and Payment Methods' and 'help/#price-calculation'. You can see it doesn't have to be ridiculously expensive - but it can be - the larger the object the bigger the cost. The site is very user friendly and immersive, even if you don't plan to print right off take a look, it is fascinating. A very good article &#34;Sculpteo Opens its 3D Printing Cloud Engine to the Public, BY ANDREW WHEELER MAY 8, 2015&#34; explained how this all works. Also &#34;HP & Sculpteo Partner to 3D Print Directly from Sprout BY DAVIDE SHER AUGUST 3, 2015&#34;. Both are most helpful. If you care to read super there are 3 other articles about Sculpteo I read:<br /><br />Sculpteo: French, Web-Based 3D Printing Service Sculpteo Puts Down Roots in Silicon Valley by Debra Thimmesch | Sep 30, 2015<br />Staples’ New Sculpteo-Powered Online 3D Printing Service Launches by Scott J Grunewald | Sep 17, 2015<br /><br />Finally go to you tube and watch a demo &#34;Baig: Here's what HP's new Sprout can do&#34;.<br /><br />I did all this reading and watching while I was waiting for the 55 pound box to arrive and have been playing with it the last 30 days with no complaints at this time.

I have a 55\" monitor weighing 50 pounds on it, and it is rock solid.  I can rotate the screen side to side with no concerns.  It also gives no indication of tipping over when pushed or pulled.<br /><br />I really liked the compartmentalization of tools, fasteners, screws and spacers.  If there is a screw needed to attach the monitor that is not included, I would be very surprised.  Hanging the monitor on the stand can be done alone, but get someone to help if you can.<br /><br />The one thing that loses this stand a star is the base.  I was unable to get all four screws installed because the hole locatins were too far off.  The sheet metal is also thin and will easily depress if you put something onto it or lean on it.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very good choice for a stand.",

Instead it says to remove packaging material, remove the USB connector from the back of the keyboard and connect to an empty USB on the computer and viola it works. Not true.<br /><br />First I had to insert 2 AAA batteries into the keyboard and 2 AAA batteries into the mouse. Batteries are NOT included.  Then I removed the USB receiver from the back of the keyboard and inserted it into an empty USB on my computer. I then slid the mouse button into the on position and everything worked.<br /><br />After using this for a while, I hate this set, particularly the mouse. First of all the keyboard and mouse are not ergonomically designed. They are so flat and low profile that my hands are not at a comfortable angle for typing. I like keyboards that have those lift feet in the back. This keyboard does not. The worst part is the mouse since the hand rests completely flat and not at an angle like most mice. I also find the left and right controls on the mouse very sticky in the sense that they do not respond quickly to my clicks. The roll wheel works wonderfully, however.<br /><br />In addition to the above, if the mouse is not used continuously, it goes to sleep even though I leave it in the ON position. In order to wake it up, I originally thought I had to turn it on and off (because the instructions do not say what to do). However, if I press down on the wheel, it will wake up for use again.<br /><br />In summary, this set is functional but not one that works for me due to the low profile of both the keyboard and mouse and the sticky mouse buttons.

Glow doesn’t last too long but if you put it under a direct light source then you get some decent glow from it.

The sound when playing music is immersive and you can distinguish each instrument in the band.  It take a couple uses and recharge to increase the battery to the stated 36 hour battery life.  Keep in mind max volume will decrease this.  But, 36 hours is an average with average volume and other factors.

It's tiny, and projects an image onto a surface that looks a lot better than I expected. I own some professional grade projectors that I use for work, so to be fair, you can't compare it to a real product like that. For starters, this needs an extremely dark room to work in. Don't even bother during daylight hours unless you have a room with no windows.<br />But, it comes with Android built in so you're actually able to stream content without plugging anything into it! You can install standard streaming apps, or load up an SD card with content to play, or use the ports behind the rubber gasket if necessary. This thing even does auto keystone if you tilt it, which really surprised and impressed me! And because the back is flat and doesn't block any vents, you can actually lie it down facing the ceiling!<br />But here's the fatal flaw: The battery isn't great, and when it dies it is very easy to get stuck in this sort of \"limbo\" state. I managed to twice already boot it without enough battery left to finish booting, and it gets stuck in this trying-to-turn-on mode in which it won't turn off but also won't turn on. Sometimes you can get the projector to show the boot logo if there's enough power for that, but then if it doesn't finish, it shuts off and gets stuck. You can see a little blue light inside, hear something making noise if you hold it to your ear, but it won't finish booting. It also won't TURN OFF. It's stuck like that, the power switch position doesn't matter once this happens. And charging it up won't help either. You need to wait for the battery to totally die (you can see the blue light inside finally turn off) and THEN charge it all the way up, and then it will boot and work correctly.<br />This is a pretty big flaw in my opinion. This thing really could have used a reset button or way to pull the battery in case this happens. The instructions are pretty terrible too, most of it I had to figure out on my own. But if they can manage to fix that flaw, this is an impressively cool device! I'm going to try and keep it charged and use it on our next camping trip, I really love that you can sit it on it's back and aim the projector at a ceiling! But part of me feels like it is pretty likely to get stuck in this state again.",

I'm guessing I'm thinking too much, and the thickness doesn't matter, otherwise it would have been mentioned in the manual, or the video they uploaded. So the term you want to search for on Amazon is, \"open end power cord.\" At 12awg, there seems to only be 3 prong cables available. You can still use this, and  just ignore the ground wire. I do see a 2 prong version at 14 awg. That's the one I'll get to complete my project. This would be 5-Stars if we didn't have to hunt down our own power, or strip our own power cord.

I own 3 other Bluetooth speakers, one lower price point, one \"moderate\"/medium, and another that is comparable in price to this unit.  None comes close to the sound quality.<br /><br />It's really unobtrusive looking, almost drab, slightly \"retro\" in a gunmetal gray with a darker gray screen.  A single button surrounded by a ring on top of the unit controls everything that needs controlling (on/off, volume and skip).  A thick rubber base keeps it from sliding around on polished tables (like a nightstand, where I'll be keeping this).<br /><br />It took just over 3 hrs to fully charge using the included wall charger and cable.  I paired it with my iPhone -- nothing tricky there -- and proceeded to play music.  I'm a conductor/composer and write mostly music for choirs, so that's what I tend to listen to most of the time.  First up:  the [[ASIN:B0018NQ066 Britten: War Requiem (2 CDs)]]  I'm intimately familiar with this work, having performed it three times and conducted rehearsals for it on one occasion.  It's one of my \"desert island\" recordings.  It has a huge variety of \"sound\" from soft/slim orchestration to full out full orchestra and chorus.  The LG performed beautifully.  NO distortion, every slight nuance was audible.  The recording is a quality recording but I've listened to it on all my other wireless speakers as well as my Bose surround wired speaker set up, and the performance of this small LG speaker is impressive.  Seriously exceptional performance.<br /><br />OK, next up, something completely different:  Fleetwood Mac [[ASIN:B00B1MHXY2 Rumours]] -- again, virtually flawless performance.  All the \"bits\" of percussion come through crystal clear.  It has a decent bass sound, too -- again something I wasn't expecting from a unit in this price point or of this size.<br /><br />I've been playing this almost non-stop for over 5 hours and it's showing no signs of low battery.  The description here says it runs 9 hrs on a single charge; I'm beginning to believe it.  Also, it shuts off after 20 minutes if these is no input (Bluetooth mode). You can also turn it off from your smartphone using the app downloaded from the iOS app store (there's an Android version, too).<br /><br />This has no built-in microphone, so you can't take phone calls on it.  It's just a speaker but a VERY good one.<br /><br />I really can't find anything wrong with this so far.  It's really that good.",

The honeycomb design and the RGB might be a big factor in one's decision.  The buttons on the cooler control the LED light modes (I counted at least 8, plus hold the button to turn off).  The power button will power on/off by holding it, but tapping the button while the cooler is on will toggle the number of fans that are turned on.  The plus and minus buttons control fan speed.  Unfortunately, there are only three speeds available but combine that with the ability to turn some fans off, one can achieve many levels of cooling.  For me, it would be all on at full blast because I use my laptop for gaming or video editing.<br /><br />Overall, great product that should help to keep the GPU temperature low for max performance.",

So now you can only mount to a wall rather than a horizontal surface like your eves or soffit unless you just want to surveil the ground because of the awful range of motion of the mount. You could drill through your siding if you wish, but it sure would be better to drill through a $2 piece of soffit. The original bracket was no gem and I’m sure they got plenty of complaints about the fact that you couldn’t adjust that one in the wall mount config. Why not just supply both or better yet one that’s engineered properly? I know they exist and aren’t very expensive because I just bought a 3 pack of mounts for $18! Unbelievable. Maybe I’ll update when my SECOND ORDER AREIVES so I can finish this project. And just expect to be changing batteries all the time unless your outdoor environment is actually a climate controlled testing area.

It does indeed work as advertised, but it is not a particularly remarkable product.<br /><br />As a 4GB storage device, it does well enough but I noticed that the copy rate is somewhat slow. I did a side-by-side comparison with a SanDisk Cruzer stick and found that the SanDisk outperformed the Verbatim by an average of 2 meg/sec. That's an appreciable speed difference! When copying larger files, it means longer waits while the copy completes. For the impatient, this is bad.<br /><br />I do not like the fact that the contact points are exposed and there is no cover for them. This equates to more opportunities for dirt and oil to contaminate the contacts which may eventually affect reliability.<br /><br />As a paper clip (this product's other touted function) it performs well for a small number of pages but quickly is outdone when trying to clip together more pages or pages made with thicker paper.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but I cannot recommend this product.

It’s absolutely very fast and has wonderful connection reliability but suffers from a very slow software installation process.<br /><br />I connected it to a Windows 7 64-bit system and allowed Windows to search for a driver. When that failed (as I assumed it would since this is a new product) I put in the installation CD and started the installer. The process took a surprisingly long time just to install and load the driver, to the point that I considered rebooting the box and starting over. It did finish though and then was ready to connect.<br /><br />It connected without effort to our 5GHz network and immediately was able to serve up content. Everything seemed to be faster but we were not sure - until my teenage son connected to a Minecraft server and started playing. In addition to a lag-free connection he noticed about a 20% gain in frame rates sustained.<br /><br />So far I can’t find anything beyond the clunky install that stands out as a negative. This is a fast adapter and it worth the one-time install time if you want fast, reliable connections and have a router that can handle the 802.11ac standard.",

            "question": "title: It works, but no microphone. I still miss my phone's native jack. (not TRRS?)\ntext: For the record: I hate this trend in mobile phones to push us away from a standard 3.5mm jack. I tried to hold onto a phone that had one for as long as I could, but when my Galaxy S10 had to go, I needed an adapter. I love using my high end studio IEMs for music instead of bluetooth or cheap USB-C headphones, and sometimes if my bluetooth earpiece isn't charged, I want to grab my laptop headphones with their in-line mic to do handsfree calls.<br />Well, I'm happy to say at least I can use this for music with my IEMs and other wired headphones. But I think the jack might be TRS and not TRRS. That means it is missing the extra pin to support the microphone if your headphones have one.<br />In a nutshell, this will turn a pair of regular stereo (no mic) headphones into a USBC compatible one, but it still isn't as good as a native 3.5mm jack. The real ones used to detect if there was a mic pin attached and give you the ability to use your headphone mic, or use the phone's mic if there wasn't the extra pin. This just defaults to no pin.",

First, the cameras have a tendency to drop connectivity all at once, and the only recourse is to power them off and back on again. This may be a function of the router we are using, but it still is important to keep in mind. Second, we loaded the software on a laptop and used that for controlling the cameras, and that worked well until the laptop was allowed to hibernate. When it came back, communication with the cameras was lost every time and the cameras needed to be power cycled. Though communication was lost with the cameras, the cameras continued to faithfully record so it could be worse.<br /><br />The cameras with this system are billed as HD and live up to it. Video is clear and crisp.<br /><br />The night vision capabilities on the outdoor camera are outstanding. Seeing in the dark is one of this particular camera's strengths. Unfortunately, the indoor camera does not have night vision so recording down a dark hallway will give poor results. This is an unfortunate design decision and hopefully will be addressed later.<br /><br />The cameras are activated by motion, and the sensitivity is set via a slider in the control software. At the highest sensitivity level, the slightest movement triggers the camera and it starts recording. For an outdoor unit this is too sensitive and the camera will eat through its storage quickly. However, for indoor cameras this is a fine setting when the home is unoccupied for a time.<br /><br />The cameras can handle larger memory cards but ship with 2GB cards. This is sufficient for starting off but for extended use you'll want a larger memory card.<br /><br />Because the cameras can be monitored remotely over the internet it is interesting to &#34;tune in&#34; and see what's happening (you can even tap in through your cell phone). It is also useful to transfer the contents of the cards remotely too.<br /><br />The cameras do not have a battery backup system, so put them on a battery backup if possible. When the power goes out, the eyes go dim.<br /><br />Logitech has put together a very nice security system that sports a number of nice features. There is room for improvement and there are some flaws, but overall this is a system worth the expense. Consider this system when looking for a security system setup to protect your property.",

I did end up taking our charging plate completely off before installing this, as keeping it in place prevented me from opening the console area up entirely to have complete access. The face plate that covers the housing box where the usb/hard drive is plugged in is so easy to remove when you want to dump footage onto your computer. The arrow sticker inside makes it easy to get the usb plugged right back in as well. While we only have one Tesla, so I wouldn’t have a need to repurchase, I’d definitely recommend to other Tesla owners trying to find a good solution.",

The USB and lightning plugs are securely attached, and it doesn't look like there will be any problems with the cord cover fracturing at either point (I've had that problem with other cables, including the original one that came with an earlier iPhone).  The plugs seat securely into my charger and iPhone 5S, too.  I have a Case Logic rubber case [[ASIN:B00JMPXGOQ Case Logic CLIPH5-3203 iPhone 5/5s 2-piece Hand Grip - White/Gray]] on my iPhone, and the cord fits just fine.<br /><br />The cord is 10' long -- that's longer than any of my other cords, and will come in handy for those times when I need to recharge from a plug that's not nearby.  This is NOT a \"small\" cord -- it's going to take up some space while traveling, but to me, it's worth it.<br /><br />So far, I have noticed no issues at all.  It plays nicely with my iPhone, with no hiccups or problems.  I'll be traveling with it soon, and will update this review if I notice any issues at all.  Otherwise, so far, I'm impressed.  I received a sample for review purposes, with no assurance of a positive review.  My opinion is based solely on my experience with the product.",

With ads - I am simply in love with this pure reading device.  It is everything I wanted and here is why I am in love:<br />1. The touch aspect to create new collection folders was so easy and then moving the books into them was intuitively easy (much easier than the KK,which was frustratingly slow);<br />2. Set up was real easy as the step by step guide was really helpful;<br />3. Moving some of my previously purchased books from the cloud to the new kindle was so easy, simple tap multiple books and when you switch back to the home page, they were downloaded really fast!  Wow.  I was worried this transfer was going to be a painful process, woohoo - so not the case.<br />4. Light adjustment was easy and reading in a dark room was easy and no eye strain!!! Super whoop whoop. (update: I am in double of getting sleepless nights! The reading in the dark was sooo comfortable, and I couldn't stop reading!  Wow.  Love it).<br />5. The touch screen was so easy to use and very intuitive and I do like the fonts selection!<br />6. Now has a little clock on top right wephen you are on the home page so I can check when to start cooking dinner!<br />7. There is finally a password (numbers only) at last to protect access to your kindle!!!<br />8. Great size and easy to hold in one hand and easy to touch and move the page, which was nice and responsive.<br />9. Shop kindle is the same as is the location of the ads, which I do not find intrusive as it only appears when your screen is asleep and not when you are reading!  Had no issue with it with my KK, and no issue with the ads now!<br />10. I upgraded to the 3G- i had to goto the lobby that would prompt the 3G- nice!!! My KK only had wifi.<br />11. Extra pixel, you certainly notice it against the KK! But your brain and yes adjust very quickly so it may seem like nothing, but relatively, the improvement is noticeable!<br /><br />Yes, I understand why some people are not happy with the light projection, as there are four lights projected from the bottom of the screen, which does create a little teeny weeny shadow.  It is not so annoying at all, not for me and it Does not interrupt the reading experience since the wee shadow do not affect the text.  Just my experience.<br /><br />All round for me, this kindle is everything I want in a kindle!  I am soooooooo happy and yes, the upgrade, for me, from a KK was worth it.  I am in love!",

I thought the technology would've improved that a 800 dollar new laptop would perform better then a 4 year old 1200 dollar computer. I was wrong. I averaged 60 fps with major lag spikes in teamfights in League of legends a 10+ year old game. I expected 120+ with the screen at 144hz. But it wasn't the screen holding me back it was the gpu, I guess. Also had poor performance in Dota 2. I wouldn't recommend this laptop. Also the volume on the speakers never rose over 50% it seemed. I couldn't hear the other players voices in dota 2 with everything on max. It was the computer, my note 20 is faster, clearer, battery stronger, and a smoother experience in League of Legend wild rift. So if you don't mind dying everytime there are more the 1 thing going on like single player games, go ahead and get this. But if you want to be frustrated every time you play, go ahead and get this \"gaming\" laptop. I didn't even try any of the AAA games, so maybe it's just the games I play.

            "question": "title: Bright & Clear Images\ntext: The Epson Home Cinema 2100 projector is an upgrade for our basement family room. We had a ViewSonic projector prior to this so that is what I am using for comparison. The Epson one is significantly brighter than the VS one. The room doesn't have to be completely darkened to get a good image. We also use this with a real movie screen as opposed to a painted wall.  Images are also nice and clear.  We've mounted it on a homemade platform that my husband constructed. It has a decent speaker built in, but for movie watching, it's definitely better to have it connected to a home theater sound system. It's also much quieter than the View Sonic in terms of the fan cooling noise. The ViewSonic's noisy fan is the reason we acquired the older projector from my husband's boss.  The remote is easy to navigate.  There was no special set up was required. Watching movies with a projector really make movie nights more fun!",

You can either access the Voice Assistant by holding the microphone button down on the remote control, where the remote's mic sends your command to the TV, or by simply (and more conveniently) speaking out loud, saying the Google Wake Words, and then the TV's internal microphone hears you and Google responds. You can control a lot of features just with your voice, without having to touch the remote control. This includes turning the TV off, or muting the sound, or lowering or raising the volume, etc.<br /><br />However, on the TV I received, the internal microphone is dead. Or, it's some other hardware failure. Yes, the microphone switch is set to the ON position. Yes, the setting to allow my voice to control the TV is on. Yes, 2 separate Sony tech support reps accessed my TV via the Remote Access feature and went through everything. It was extensive. Yes, the TV has all the updates, and a factory reset was done.

            "question": "title: Only works fully on one of three devices I tried but has a nice stereo sound when it works\ntext: I tried this speaker on the Google Nexus 7, iPhone 5, and iPad 3.<br /><br />- With the Google Nexus 7 the speaker would only work very well while on Bluetooth connected to Rock Out (the speaker's Bluetooth). If I connected the cable to the headset port, the sound only came out as a whisper.  I verified that the volume was on max on both the speaker and the Nexus 7.  The documentation says &#34;Know that when you're hardwired in for sound, the external controls are optimized for Apple devices.&#34; This explains why my Nexus 7 does not work when wired to the speaker.<br /><br />- With the iPad 3, I was able to connect via the headset port and via Bluetooth without any problems and the sound was adequate but not fantastic even on the highest volume.<br /><br />- With the iPhone 5, I was only able to connect via the headset port. When we connected via Bluetooth no sound would come out of the device. My boyfriend and I tried several times (about 6 times). We tried while on both the cellular network and also on my wi-fi network and were able to connect to Rock Out but never could get the sound to work. There was one time where it disconnected itself when we went back to look but except for that once, it remained connected throughout. There's a Bluetooth Memory reset by turning the speaker on, pressing and holding the power button for 10 seconds and then pairing the device with the iPhone.  I verified that the unit was also fully charged.  As long as I was connected via the headset cable I could answer calls by pressing the play button on the unit. However, no matter what my boyfriend and I did, we could not get Bluetooth to work on the iPhone 5.<br /><br />The R0S2 is definitely rugged and when it works the sounds is adequate to very good. Only my boyfriend's iPhone 5 with the OtterBox installed would fit into the case of the unit for storage. Anything larger than this won't fit, which means the device has to be hanging off the unit if Bluetooth does not work or Bluetooth will have to be used so that the case can remain zippered up.<br /><br />Based on my measurements, any item that is 5-1/2 inches wide by 2-3/4 inches tall by 1/2 inch thick should fit inside the case.  I also weighed the case and it was almost one pound (15.7 ounces). For me it is not worth it to carry an extra pound of gear backpacking.  Also, unless one is kayaking, biking, or out in the sun, the unit does not charge in the shade and according to the directions, it takes 8 hours to fully charge via solar power.<br /><br />As long as there was some sun, I noticed the unit charging.  As per the directions, it will take about 8 hours to solar charge.  I charged mine in about 2 hours using my computer's USB port.  The documentation says the run time is 10 hours but after almost two hours of use, I noticed only 2 bars on the charge when I plugged it back in for recharging.<br /><br />The unit can be daisy chained to other Rock Out speakers for more sound.  The unit has a 3.5 mm audio jack (line-level) and a 5V USB charging cord. According to the box, the speakers are 3W. The battery is a Lithium-ion, 3.7V, 800 mAh, 3Wh.<br /><br />Another thing I noticed is that because the case bottom is not totally flat, the speaker has to be balanced to sit upright without falling over. Every time I tried it either fell forward or back so I had to lean it against something.  Of course if it is secured to backpack or bicycle basket this is a non-issue.<br /><br />In summary, I love the rugged case and think the sound is great to just okay depending on the item or material being played or the device it is paired with.  I like that movies can be paused just by pressing the pause button on the speaker or that I can go to the next song by pressing the advance button.  I have a hard time believing that backpackers will want to carry this almost one-pound speaker with them especially if hiking in the woods where there is usually no sun to charge the unit. Even though the bungee cord around the outside of the unit is thin, it has some clip hooks attached for fastening to a backpack or bicycle basket that should keep it secure. I like the olive green color because it is camouflaged for nature as it was designed to take backpacking. I give this 2.6 stars and recommend with reservations because the unit does not always work with the headset jack or on Bluetooth.  Whether it is going to work or not apparently depends on the unit being connected to the device.  When it works it's great; when it doesn't it is disappointing. I think the current price of $129.99 is also a bit steep.<br /><br />UPDATE Dec 20, 2014<br /><br />March 10, 2017 - Today I tried again to pair this with my [[ASIN:B00O0M750W HP OMEN 15-5010nr Gaming Notebook with Beats Audio]] and I was finally able to get it to work where a couple of years ago no sound came out of the speaker.  The unit was fully charged as usual. Pairing seems to be hit or miss.",

I use mine to transform a 3.5mm jack in a [[ASIN:B004VQDAQK Powerwerks PW50 Portable PA System]] into a third channel and this adapter works perfectly for that.<br /><br />Note that I am not expecting stereo signals and have not tested this adapter to ensure that it supports that function.<br /><br />Reading over other reviews complaining about flimsy construction and myriad other problems leads me to conclude that the adapter I received is a new and improved version. It's not particularly flimsy and both sides mate with their respective plugs with no tolerance issues.<br /><br />Since I am using this to reclaim a channel on a relatively inexpensive powered mixer I cannot comment on signal quality. It's not especially noisy, but on the other hand if I were using this to enjoy music through headphones I would have probably purchased a higher quality adapter.<br /><br />Bottom line: I am pleased with this adapter, but note that you do get what you pay for. If you want a quick fix like for what I am using mine for it's a bargain. If you want an adapter for high end stereo gear you may want to consider a higher end adapter like the [[ASIN:B0002E51CQ Planet Waves 1/8 Inch Female Stereo to 1/4 Inch Male Stereo Adapter]].",
