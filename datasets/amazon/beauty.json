For me I thought &#34;there is no way this is going to work&#34;. So what do I do I order it anyways because hey I love the earth, but I want to be pretty too. I've had this stuff for like a week already and even though my toes look like they have been through war I still just keep staring at it. Well today I finally decide to take the plunge. I read all of the instructions and see that you have to let it &#34;sit&#34; on your nails for 2-5 minutes. It's very difficult for me to stay still that long, so I figure I'll try it out and see what happens. Mind you I am not trying this on any regular nail polish, no. I have the polish from my last pedicure which is a light pink glitter polish AKA the worst type of polish to try to remove. I feel like I'm setting this stuff up to fail, right. So I grab the dropper and fill it up. I place a few drops on each toe (for those of you keeping track this is a watery formula and will not stay well if you move at all). I did keep moving about my business for 5-6 minutes. I then return with some cotton pads. I wipe the big toe not expecting much and almost the entire polish wipes away in one swipe. I kid you not more than 3/4 of the polish was gone in one swipe. I'm in disbelief at this point, so I stare and pick at it like it's going to talk to me. After a few minutes in awe I finish the rest of my toes. I did have to go back and do it one more time because my toes are very curved and like I said I cannot sit still, however it didn't bother me at all. This stuff removed disgusting glitter polish in less time and less smell than any other product I've ever used. I am so impressed that I keep staring at the pad I used to remove the polish. It's like it just melted it into a sheet and it just slides off of my nail. It's really cool. I am impressed also that I do not need a ton of this stuff to remove all the polish for my toes so I'm thinking it will last a while. I will re-order this stuff once mine runs out. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wears nail polish ever. I do need to mention that I did receive this product for free to review. Please understand that my review is based only on my own experience with this product and the cost has no impact on my review.",

This will be a lengthy review, but if you are like me, I hope you'll enjoy the very detailed essay I am about to write for the 2nd time because my original review closed out of the page :(<br /><br />I will preface this by letting you know I have coarse, curly hair. \"bUt hEaThEr, wHat nUmBer aNd pOroSitY aRe YoU?\".<br />I am 3a-c and high porosity. Now, it is storytime LOL, so grab a snack or an adult bev.<br /><br />Let me tell you about the root, no pun intended, of a good portion of my self esteem issues LOL. When I was a kid, I was teased relentlessly about my hair. Ah yes, even Rave/LA Looks gel, with a spritz of White Rain hairspray couldn't tame this! Kids are mean. I ran cross country all through high school, and with many mornings having only an hour to get ready after running until my bunions ached (what the heck heather, TMI!), I eventually learned the only way to keep these people from throwing tiny paper balls in my hair or touching it, was to throw it in a bun. Containment, if you will. That thing was so tight I could hardly think straight. Does that explain my grades lol? So, my hair means a lot to me, y'all!<br /><br />Moving onto the stuff you really want to know, the magical brush I'm in love withüíñ<br /><br />This brush has what I assume are nylon bristles. The only suggestion I have is to replace them with boar bristles, but it isn't a deal breaker. A few, and I mean 2 or 3, of those bristles came out when I was examining this baby before using it. It has pins and bristles all the way around and up and down. They don't tug at the hair or stretch it to damage or snap damp hair. I did brush my hair out with a wet brush before using, though.<br /><br />The brush is so lightweight, I didn't think it was going to do much lol. Thank you to the manufacturer for making it so lightweight! It was such a breeze to brush the sections of hair. My wrists were happy :)<br /><br />The brush does get hot, but not too hot! I accidentally touched the metal part a few times and I still have all my fingers! Yeehaw! There is a little knob that sticks out, to grasp onto as you roll the brush through your hair. You could probably use a straightening glove too! I have never used a Revlon brush, nor touched one irl. So, take that for what it is, but I've watched A LOT of videos on YouTube with that specific brush. I believe the Revlon is heavier and hotter than this brush. I have heard of some gals smelling burning. I did not experience that. I did use a heat protectant (up to 450¬∞) along with a leave in cream. By the way, there is an air (I assume cool) setting, which is amazing as it is actually regar air! Not semi warm air like some dryers I've used in the past. The low setting is low and the high is faster and hotter. They light up so you know what is what! Love it.<br /><br />Please don't expect this to smooth it out like a flat iron would. This provides the perfect base though, to smooth with a flat iron quickly. It took me from start to finish about 50 mins. Some of that time was spent sectioning and spraying the hair with protectant, as well as doing some house stuff. Realistically it maybe took 40 mins. I did wait after my wash and condition, to let the hair dry a little bit. To about 85%. I even spritzed dry sections with water as needed, so my brush could glide through. I've only used this 2x. Once on wet hair and once for a touch up. I'm hoping to be as good as Julissa Guillen on YouTube, as I use this more :) maybe I'll be faster and it'll be smoother too!<br /><br />I used this before bedtime, so I don't have a day of wear pics available for you.<br /><br />But, the second pic shows my hair wet, unbrushed.<br /><br />The third pic is right after finishing! AMAZING! I was literally in awe! Couldn't believe it. Even after cosmetology school, I couldn't master a blowout on myself *cries*<br /><br />The fourth pic is the next morning. Slept on a regular cotton pillowcase (I should get a satin one from Amazon lol). I left it down while I slept btw.<br /><br />The last pic is after a go through with the flat iron. I didn't have to section my hair for once to flat iron my hair! I just ran it through with some more heat protectant as well, a must have :D<br /><br />Besides the boar bristle suggestion, I did notice the words on the dryer are already faded. It doesn't affect the dryer, so I really don't care lol. The other thing was the twisty thing to turn the dryer on, doesn't line up directly with the lights and words (OFF, AIR, LOW, HIGH). Again, I don't care but everyone different, so I wanted to let you beautiful awesome people know!<br /><br />Overall, I am so impressed and so upset at myself for not getting one of these sooner. Can't beat the value and it comes with a warranty. Thank you HAUSBELL, I LOVE YOU!‚ù£üíûü•∞üíá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",

It is so soft my hand does slide around a little bit over the fabric when its dry  I was initially wondering if it would slip off my hand, but it molds to my hand and becomes easily pliable once wet and more grippy. It has enough flat loofah attached to buff away dry skin  but not so rough to irritate my skin. I love that I can easily rinse and wring the water/soap out of it. Loofah in the whole or stick form does not wring out easily therefore it is not uncommon for parts of them to get dark and smell musty. These loofah pads are so pliable its easy to wring  out water  like a towel and has a convenient loop to hang dry. In theory they should not smell musty if water is dried quickly from them. I haven't had them long enough to see if they turn, since my solid one on a stick from local store didn't turn for weeks.  I have dry middle age skin and I love that this little loofah pad works away the dry skin to softness underneath. Part of an at home spa experience. Extra perk! it comes with 2 pads.

There's a little bit of a natural aroma of the ingredients but it is not offensive. It smells like just about every other fragrance-free product The big difference is that this one is way more effective than most other products of this type that I've tried.

The brown tinting is excellent for UV protection of the contents. The accessories are mostly useful items, with the best ones being the caps and the funnel. The caps have an insert to provide an excellent seal, which is key to maintaining content freshness. They also come with spray heads that, while functional, are rather lightweight in terms of build quality.<br /><br />All in all, an excellent set of bottles that are packaged very well, and come with some very useful extras.

Hair doesn't frizz and and keeps a consistent curl pattern. I don't run from humid weather and my curls come out different depending on the humidity if I air dry it -but never frizzed! I wash and reapply every 3 (as instructed) to 5 days (when I'm cheating).

It's a generous 3.4 oz of cream for your money, and you don't need to apply a lot to get the bene fit.  So if you have dry skin anywhere on your body, I would say don't hesitate to try this stuff.

            "question": "title: Not Sure if This is a Joke\ntext: I honestly don‚Äôt even know WHERE to begin with this review ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è<br /><br />I have, in my lifetime ‚Äì and, wearing ‚Äúfake‚Äù nails for OVER 25 YEARS ‚Äì NEVER seen this type of ‚Ä¶ idea ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è<br /><br />I‚Äôll be as short as possible with this ‚Ä¶<br /><br />Most anyone who hasn‚Äôt had an amputation, usually has 8 fingers and 2 thumbs ‚Äì total of 10 ‚ÄúDIGITS‚Äù ‚úãüèªü§öüèª And, in MOST cases ‚Äì the nails are usually shaped the same.<br /><br />Thus, in a set of nails you‚Äôd need:<br /><br />üíÖüèª 2 ‚Äì Thumb nails<br />üíÖüèª 2 ‚Äì Index fingernails<br />üíÖüèª 2 ‚Äì Middle fingernails<br />üíÖüèª 2 ‚Äì Ring fingernails<br />üíÖüèª 2 ‚Äì Pinkie fingernails<br /><br />I know ‚Äì sounds almost silly or stupid to mention, but that‚Äôs math. Total ‚ÄúNAILS‚Äù needed: 10 ‚Ä¶ (‚ÄúLuxury 12pcs press on nails kit comes with 10 different sizes which is pre-numbered 0-9 in a box‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúchoose the most suitable size that fits you every finger‚Äù). Hard to fit every finger when the nails are different sizes.<br /><br />And, we‚Äôre NOT all sized the same. Hence why some packaging is no less than 24 nails with 12 sizes. I know because I‚Äôve bought nails like this for YEARS! Just look up KISS and you‚Äôll see what I am talking about.<br /><br />This?<br /><br />Was this a joke? This is a set of TWELVE (12) nails ‚Äì 10 different sizes! ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è<br /><br />Unlike the model hands ‚Äì I don‚Äôt wear my nails OVER the edges of my finger. That is NOT how you wear these nails to begin with ‚Äì and definitely NOT with nail glue. Even being ‚Äúfake‚Äù, the nails should at LEAST attempt to look realistic. See how the salons do them, look on Google (or your favorite search engine).<br /><br />Who thought this was a great idea? And, these HAVE to be the LARGEST sizes for the particular ‚Äúnails‚Äù I‚Äôve seen. These really are a fancier version of the Lee and Wet N‚Äô Wild from the late 1980‚Äôs/early 1990‚Äô.<br /><br />What‚Äôs worse? Even the PACKAGING states: 24<br /><br />Did they not think anyone would notice that detail?<br /><br />I‚Äôll admit, these are pretty. And, thinking it was a HALF package, I contacted Amazon for a return/replacement. I cancelled the replacement, but I am returning these. As I told the rep ‚Äì they‚Äôre pretty useless as they are. There is NO way I can use these. I would, at MINIMUM, only get 4 nails worth of coverage. For this price? Nope. Not at all. And, I feel sorry for those who do have to pay.<br /><br />In addition, the nearly $16 price tag (excluding sales tax) for 12 nails? Unreasonable. In my case, I‚Äôd need TWO (2) sets which would run $32. For that price ‚Äì I might as well just wear a mask, go to the salon, and have them do it for me. My nails would definitely last two weeks, and I wouldn‚Äôt have to do them myself.<br /><br />I will not be getting these again and DO NOT recommend them. The seller might have a better set out there, but not this selection.",

I love the long chiseled pencil shape because it makes it easier to apply straight stokes of color to my very thin brows without looking drawn on or penciled in. However, it does skip a bit compared to my gel brow color that is applied with a brush. The sponge tip is great for softening the sharp line on the thicker area of my brow and i dab it with a bit of eye shadow to set it.  The color stays put and looks natural without leaning towards red. What more can you ask of a good brow pencil for brunettes? I overplucked my brows in my youth when pencil-thin brows were was the style (okay, I'm dating myself here) but this seems to apply quickly and easily and works well with super-thin brows without making me look like Groucho Marx. It works, it stays and looks great. Gals with thicker brows will reap the most benefit b using the mascara type brush for the most natural look and pigment distribution.",

This pink train case is all and more than I expected and I am beyond thrilled to own this now. In the past I have thrown all my makeup in a zippered travel case and then had to try and sift through the items inside to locate what I was looking for. Sometimes I would just dump the contents out because it was such a struggle. With this pink beauty, all my items can be nicely organized and will stay right when I put them. When closed up, nothing is going to move around and when opened up, everything is right within easy reach and easy to find. This has a large mirror which was a great surprise to me that sits at a perfect height and angle when putting on my makeup. I have struggled for some time to find a way to use a hand held make up mirror while trying to put on my makeup while traveling.  I also really appreciated that the top two sections have plastic on the bottom of the tray. We all know that makeup can get messy if spilled and this will allow for easy clean-up if such a thing should ever happen.

You can't just take it off without PROPERLY storing your hair pieces, wigs, etc. Use GENTLE shampoo & DO NOT wash often. There's no need to if properly taken care of, WHEREVER you purchase them. There was NO hair following out. People like to \"play\" with their hair. That's where the troubles start with  letting yourself or other people start putting their fingers through them, especially synthetic pieces. TIP: I have a dressing room in my home. I take a spot on one of my walls, put a decent size large hook with the ball at the end of the hook. I attach them to my wall. When I'm done using the wig, I take it off my head, make sure its combed out to its natural state & hag them on the hook to dry. DO NOT BLOW DRY. Comb from the BOTTOM up. And that's it. IF your wigs start getting a little frazzled, especially long wigs, try spraying a little Olive oil, made especially for wigs. As a matter of fact, for THIS low cost, buy another one.",

Nothing else compares.\ntext: Several years ago I had purchased a blowdryer with a similar attachment. I absolutely adored that thing - you could use it on the top of your hair or the sides to give lift so your hair had volume without using any product or doing any backbrushing. The thing was a miracle worker!<br /><br />Then we entered the era of pin straight hair, and volume and body were out. Thank God, we seem to be passing that era, but hairstyling implements seem to be lagging behind. I was dying to try this diffuser to see if it emulated the gizmo from long ago, and it does. Well made hair styling tool that gives lift and volume to your hair, I love it. Well, kinda.<br /><br />I'm not sure how 'universal' this is. I tried it on my current blowdryer, and it didn't fit. I had to go digging around until I finally found a Conair dryer upon which it fit, and the funny thing is that it fit like it was MADE for the dryer. The odd thing is that the Conair looks to have the same kind of nozzle the other blowdryer had, so go figger.<br /><br />IF you have a blowdryer that marries this diffuser well, this is definitely something you're going to want in your hair arsenal. It'd almost be worth getting a new dryer just to use this, it's that good (one star off for the weirdess of the 'universal' claim.)",

I feel better about using this as opposed to a standard toothbrush.  I kept one for myself and it really does get a whole lot of 'tooth' all the way around.  And obviously, it must be doing something right as he had an exam a couple months after using these - No cavities, good gum health, clean teeth.  Yay!",

Edit: to Cindy: the powder from your callous builds up in a cup under the rotary n u have to easily take apart each time n blow it out or shake it, etc. I purchase 1 more when the came down in price. I love these things, much more than Amope. That's sand paper roll going around but these have such a good blade u have to use it responsibly or u can cut your feet, but so effective!!! If used properly!!!!  Go slow as some people have mentioned n be persistent. A couple times a week go over your feet for a few minutes. My feet were like that gentlemen's. I too was on my feet up to 16 hours a day. My feet cracked n bleed. The best moisturizer on market right now i think is Curel Hydratherapy. I have asked Derms at work n they usually say Curel. Vanicream is excellent but I find it too greasy. After using this device hydrate your feet n place cotton stockings on. Do this at bedtime too if it's really bad. I love this product, im sorry if some of u have had mechanical problems. I've used 4 of mine n I had one problem w the wire getting broken inside. I called the company n they sent out a new wire immediately. My feet are silky smooth!!  What a mess they were 15 years ago!!!!  TO JOE:  are u reviewing the correct product?  I have 4 of these because I loved them so much n never wanted to be without n u r describing this device incorrectly.  You do no charge this unit. It comes with an electrical cord like an iron n that provides electricity/power. There is no charging. I've had the 1st models n the last for sale models n I think I r reviewing a different device. Another edit!  The customer who said this isn't supposed to be an electric sander is correct.  Yes, it stops if too much pressure, it's suppose to. Another customer said the blade was not rough enuf. Yes, eventually u will need to replace blades, but metal against skin should last quite awhile. I bought several blades when they came down in price. The customers that don't like it seem to be using it incorrectly from the start n misunderstanding the mechanics of it.  It's really great n sad Amazon is not selling it right now.  I have gotten so many people on this device!!!!",

            "question": "title: A Bit Difficult to Use but Produces Very Pretty Curls!\ntext: For many years I've always straightened my hair because I cannot seem to get the hang of using curling irons to make pretty spiral curls. Wearing the same hairstyle all the time with long hair can get a bit boring so I decided to search on Amazon for styling tools that are easy to use. I initially ordered the [[ASIN:B003FBI9LS Bed Head Deep Waver]] and really loved the results so much that I also purchased this Rock 'n' Roller styling iron, which I affectionately call my &#34;bubble curler.&#34;<br /><br />The Bed Head Rock 'n' Roller Ceramic Styling Iron comes with the iron itself along with a black protective glove to protect your hand from the heat of this iron since there is no clamp. The iron measures almost 15 inches in length, with the heating barrel measuring about 5 3/4 inches. The balls measure about one inch in diameter. The cord measures almost six feet so there is plenty of length to move around with it. The iron has a black ball at the top so you can hold it while using it, a safety stand that works well, an on/off switch, a temperature dial that allows you to choose among the low, medium, and high settings as well as the temperatures in between all of them, and a swivel cord so you can easily move the iron around as you use it. I found that it heats up quickly and cools off rapidly as well in case you need to pack it up in your suitcase soon after using it. The glove fits well but I didn't end up using it since it feels a bit awkward to use while trying to grip strands of hair so I took a chance and kept my hand bare, with no problems as long as I styled my hair in front of a mirror so I could watch closely what I was doing.<br /><br />I found this styling iron a bit difficult to use at first but it gets easier with practice. I just winged it and have included some pictures of my end result. There is a chart in the instructions as to what heat setting is most likely appropriate for your hair type but they recommend you start with the lowest setting and increase the heat as needed. I have wavy to medium hair so I started off using the low setting but ended up using the medium setting. I have long hair and it was fairly simple to wrap my hair around the barrel. When I got toward the end of the strands of hair, I carefully wrap them around the barrel, holding my fingers as close as I can to the styling iron without actually touching it. Then I roll the styling iron towards my head as close as I can so my hair gets curled as much as possible. I hold my hair in that position for about 40 seconds and then release it and curl my whole head. It probably took about a half hour to style all of my hair and then I finished by spraying it with hairspray. I didn't add any product to my hair before I started although you probably could if your hair works better that way.<br /><br />Overall, I am happy with this styling iron and really like the end result. Hopefully it will get easier to use with time. I found it a bit difficult to use because, without having a clamp on the iron, I had to hold both arms up in the air and my muscles got tired pretty quickly. I'm in fairly good shape but perhaps this will get easier with time. I actually prefer the [[ASIN:B003FBI9LS Bed Head Deep Waver]] because I feel it's easier to use and I love the beach waves I get from it so I will most likely use that one more but this one is still good to have. If you want spiral curls, I'd purchase the Rock 'n' Roller Styling Iron but if you prefer beach waves, I'd purchase the Deep Waver. The price is just what I wanted to spend and I like the fact that I can have more hairstyles than just straightened hair! I recommend purchasing this styling iron if you want to add some variety to your hairstyle and aren't comfortable using a regular curling iron to get spiral curls.",

Inside the bag were 4 neatly wrapped soap bars. These soaps are aromatherapy grade and if you smell them, you will see why. They smell so wonderful. I love that these soaps are 100% vegan, gluten free, cruelty free, sulfate/paraben/petrochemical-free, and contain no artificial fragrances or colors. What more could you ask for in a soap? In my little gift set, I received four different scented soaps: Sea Breeze, Golden Crown, Green Tea Goddess, and Luscious Lavender. I‚Äôm about ready to cry because these smell so good. I‚Äôm not even exaggerating. The soaps are naturally colored and I think the colors of each variety accurately reflects the intended scent. The soaps don't over lather by themselves, but I think that's because of being sulfate free. However, I used the Luscious Lavender with a body puff and it lathered just fine. Overall, these are wonderful soaps and this sample set is the perfect introduction to the company and would make a great gift for just about anyone.",

I had almost enough rollers to use on all of my hair (1-2 more rollers would‚Äôve been perfect). I used the roller as instructed to with partially damp here. I felt like it made my hair slightly staticky which isn‚Äôt the norm for me. It definitely gave me curls but I wouldn‚Äôt call them natural looking beach curls.<br /><br />The seller/customer service is GREAT! I was responded to quickly when I contacted them about using this item. Overall it‚Äôs a decent purchase.

It's large, though not as big as the picture made me think it would be, well made, and really smells nice. The lavender scent is definitely a stress reducer, and since it's both microwave and freezer safe you can use it hot or cold. To use hot you need to mist a little water on it (but not soak it) and microwave for 30 seconds. To use cold simply place it in the resealable plastic bag and leave it in the freezer overnight. I'm not sure if it really does anything for migraines or not since I don't get them, but everything else the manufacturer claims seems to be true so likely it has some benefits for that application as well. It's best to store it in the resealable plastic bag to make it last as long as possible since the scent comes from lavender blossoms and flax seeds rather than artificial ingredients that can be &#34;recharged.&#34;",

Not so with this brand. This brand has the natural scent of the real deal, and is effective to boot. I have a baby, so have been washing my hands about 10 times a day, every time I change his diaper. Between that and all of the diaper wipes I use, my hands have been starting to peel and crack, so I knew I needed a solution.<br /><br />This argan oil came with a regular lid, an eyedropper, and a pump dispenser. I used the pump dispenser and set it right next to my faucet so I could get a quick pump of oil every time I wash my hands. Well, it only took a couple of days to experience really great results. My hands feel normal again, and I am so relieved. From hard skin that was rough and crackled, to soft, happy hands again.<br /><br />I have also used the product on my split ends, and here, I‚Äôd like to caution you that only a few drops are needed. It is very effective and soaks and well, so you only need a very small amount.<br /><br />Overall, this argan oil is one of the best I have found. It comes packaged beautifully and looks like a gift, has multiple options for how you dispense it, and is pure, organic, and has the mild scent of real argan oil, unlike some competitors.",

The 1050x solves both problems, I can shave in less time (must be the blades it uses) and it charges very quickly (one hour, with a quick charge for emergencies).<br /><br />It comes with a travel \"sarcophagus\" (which I find a nice detail) which can also be used to charge the razor, and a charging stand; the hair deposit chambers for each blade do fill quickly, particularly with anything older than a day old stubble for me, and a sign comes up asking you to empty them - which is done quickly and easily enough.<br /><br />The only negatives are that it's quite a bit noisier than the 7120, but then again that is quite quiet... I still cannot get the best shave over the area between my mouth and my chin... But then again we all different facial features... And it's pricey...

The 5 magnet type never worked after I tried to cut them to the right size because there was never a magnet on the end, which made it impossible to get them to stay on without using glue. I found these with 10 smaller magnets and thought I would give them a try! I was able to cut them to the right size and still have magnets on both ends, so they would stay on. I am not very good at applying liquid liner, but I was able to get this liner to work just fine. I used these for my wedding and they stayed on all day/evening and weren't too heavy feeling like some lashes. They really made my eyes pop and stand out beautifully in pictures!  In the photos, the close ups were before the wedding to try them out, and although the one end wouldn't stay on that time, I was able to get it to stay on the wedding day.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like (which is the same with all of these magnetic liners) is that the liner is difficult to remove. The lashes themselves came off fine, but the liner was not easy to remove (from my skin or the lashes). I don't like to use makeup removers, so I used coconut oil. It took some time to get it off. But I don't think that's anything specific to this liner, it's the magnetic liners in general.<br /><br />I recommend these lashes over all of those 5 magnet ones!",

It looked really good. But I wanted all grey hair and so I kept going. Her hair is chin-length, so really not that long. This turned into a mess. It didn't look natural anymore and it was clumpy, etc. If you want a product to add some grey strands to your hair this is great. If you want to look 100% grey, this won't do it for you.

Whether using the deep clean mode or the one for sensitive teeth both have improved my oral hygiene greatly.  I was very impressed that the deep clean mode wasn't too intense.  My dentist is thrilled.  My gums have come back to new life a healthy pink and are no longer sensitive.  And my teeth?  The plaque removal here is superb and my sensitive teeth have improved more with this brush than with any desensitizing paste I have used.  My dentist said it is because the brush is doing what it needs to do and not stressing the teeth by using a faster speed that is just not necessary.<br /><br />Everything else about this electric toothbrush I found to be very user friendly as well.

The makeup sponge that comes with the set is terrible so I just gave it to my daughter to add to her pretend makeup. The smaller heart mat I gave to a friend and she said it works well.",

I am more into the woodsy, tea tree, sandalwood type scents. At first smell, this beard oil had a very light scent however once applied, this scent lasts a very long time. This is where I had a hard time with it. I like to put my beard oil on in the morning and night after brushing my teeth and I was still able to smell this beard oil into the next morning, which might have been a good thing had I enjoyed the scent. The beard oil itself as I said earlier, is a medium weight, and has a decent hold and is actually a nice overall beard oil but I ended up giving it to my son, as I personally didn't like the scent at all.",

            "question": "title: Very happy with this razor\ntext: I am very impressed with this razor. I have used electric razors most of my 35+ years of shaving. I was skeptical using it for the first time, I thought it wasn't working because it is so soft to the face and so quiet. It didn't sound \"agressive\" like my other razors did. WRONG!!! The shave was close, my skin was not irritated at all, and it cut smooth basically in the first pass. This unit is first class.<br /><br />My previous razor was a Braun foil. I bought one for myself and another for my son from Frys because of the price. JUNK!!! We both have heavy beards, he more so than I, and both of us had terrible 5 o'clock shadows by 10:00AM! And the skin irritation on my neck, just horrible.<br /><br />I took a long time comparing all the available models. For me this model provides the best mix of features and price. I definitely recommend the Speed-XL shaving heads. Other nice features are it can be cleaned under the faucet, it charges quickly and maintains that charge for a long time, and it provides what I consider one of the best shaves I've had in a long time. The heft and feel is good. Materials are good. Workmanship is good. The only feature I'd like to have is a battery charge indicator.<br /><br />The other Speed-XL model is the 8160. It includes the cleaning system with a much higher price. Now there is the SmartTouch-XL which may be overkill. But if price is not an issue...<br /><br />May, 2012 - I can't believe I wrote the original review almost seven years ago. I'm still using this razor and it still works just as I expressed back then. The battery still keeps a great charge, and the shave is still excellant. I went on a 10 day vacation last year and the charge held for the whole trip. This is truly a great product.",

Honestly, with most soaps the scent fades rather quickly anyway. And it does have a scent. Just not a perfume scent. It‚Äôs very pleasant. And it was super easy to lather. I had absolutely no issues. Truth be told, it lathered better than almost any soap I‚Äôve used.  What it‚Äôs not is ‚Äúfoamy‚Äù, and that‚Äôs actually a good thing. As insane as this may sound, on the face it feels like wool.

            "question": "title: Comprehensive review of robusta coffee scrub\ntext: I recently used this scrub and felt inspired to write a review about it for those that aren't sure if they should get this scrub or not.<br /><br />Before buying this scrub, I was aware coffee scrubs have been trending for a year or so.  As others, I was very skeptical about it and wasn't sure how I felt about this beauty trend. The only way I was going to find out was to give it a try.<br /><br />Here's what I learned after using it that I think will help others should you decide to try it:<br /><br />1) Prepare your environment and set aside time before using it - Prior to using the scrub, decide where you are going to use it (shower, bath, fenced backyard, etc.) because I'm warning you now, it's gonna get messy. I have a regular sized shower/bath, so if I plan on using this again, I would get myself completely wet, sit in the tub, use the scrub all over my body, rinse off (still sitting), then finally stand up to complete washing off.  If you have a private fenced off backyard where you are near a hose, that's a good setting too.  The whole process took approximately 40-50 minutes (I like to take my time). I used the whole pack because I literally used it all over my body, but you can use whatever amount you want.  Just know that you will need time to really work it into your skin and let it set for a few minutes before washing it off.<br /><br />2) Be honest with yourself about your skin regimen - What I mean is, if you are not disciplined about your skin regimen or don't want to take time to use this scrub, then honestly I don't know this product is going to work for you. Personally, I'm committed to a regular and consistent skin regimen and set aside time to use this product to get optimal results.¬†I am just saying this isn't like a typical scrub and takes more time to work it in to your skin.<br /><br />3) You'll likely need soap to get the rest of it off - Even after a rinse, it will stain, just like coffee will do, so I used some shea butter body wash and a body brush to get the rest of it off.  Once I was completely clean, I dried off and used body shop cocoa butter all over my body (it's what I usually use anyway).<br /><br />4) For people with very oily skin be aware - Since this product has coconut oil and you are highly prone to breaking out, I'm not sure if this is a good idea; the amount of coconut oil is definitely noticeable so just be aware.<br /><br />The verdict: I will say, this made me feel amazing afterwards. My skin felt very smooth and soft. That being said, I bought it without having any expectations. I tried it mainly out of curiosity. As there are advances in beauty products, I am naturally going to want to try new things. I have heard that coffee scrubs reduce cellulite or supports regeneration of new skin cells. Honestly I don't know if that's true and frankly find that doubtful.  However, I can say it is better than most scrubs I've used in the past, and it's a wonderful treat for the skin from time to time. I would buy and use it again for occasional use.",

My issues are not with the seller. Product was as described & shipped<br />quickly. I have used this product 3 x since receiving. Basically this is traditional pan make up in a tube. It's very thick & quite greasy on its own. I have tried to make good use of Dermacol, unfortunately no matter how I prep/prime/set/apply this make up broke down within in 3 hrs. My skin is normal with an occasional  break out. I have not experienced any break outs. I feel this product is truly for stage/photo use. The amount needed for &#34;full&#34; coverage would be akin to literally wearing a mask. The product did not blend & basically sat on top of the skin. As it breaks down it becomes a thin, speckled look. Primer, setting powder nor spray made a difference. Then it settles in ALL your fine lines & imperfections. It's a hard pass for me. I would like to also add, the promos with product covering tatoos etc is just hype. It May be water proof but be advised it's not smudge/rub proof.",

My hair is fine and color treated and is frequently subjected to heat from dryers and curling irons. This did leave it feeling soft and looking healthy. However it didn't do much to refresh my style and the fragrance is strong. It is not an unpleasant aroma, sweet like baby powder and light musk, but not my favorite. It is strong and it lasts all day. The bottle tucks easily into a bag or briefcase and the spray functions smoothly. I wish it either had a difference scent or was fragrance free. I appreciate the exclusion of mineral oil, petrolaltum or artificial coloring. It is an effective product that provides relief to stressed locks.",

            "question": "title: I like this heated eye mask\ntext: I like this heated eye mask, for the most part, I especially like that it exists in the first place! I was searching Amazon up and down for a heated eye mask that can be worn like a sleeping eye mask to relax my eye muscles after sitting at a computer all day when I finally came across this one. I don't care for the color or the kitty design, but the purple material is velvety soft which I do like.<br /><br />The mask easily covers my head, though I do have a small head, and the strap fits around the back of my head pretty well. I do choose to wear my hair up at night when I use this heating mask otherwise the strap slides up my straight fine hair slowly if I move my head from side to side. And I somehow never wake up with it on, though I'm thinking that has much more to do with me removing it during the middle of the night vs a product error.<br /><br />The power cord is composed of two pieces, the first has one end with a USB and the other as a round female piece. Connected to the mask on the right side is the other piece of the cord. This piece has a male round piece and connects perfectly to the female piece. I imagine this design is intended to allow the cord connected to the mask to easily be pulled out if the person moves during sleep.<br /><br />I plug the cord right into my USB-hub with my phone charger and it works perfectly well.<br /><br />The controls on this are odd, and you are provided zero instructions. There are two buttons I believe one is a (-) that is indented and the other is a (+) that is raised if my memory serves me right. You have to keep one side pressed down until the unit turns on, then I press the indented button because the numbers go up to 60 on this side. The numbers displaced are bizarre and I have no idea what unit of measurement they are - though degrees Celcius makes the most sense.<br /><br />The one thing I wish this product had was sewn in contours for the nose and eye sockets so it was able to lay more flush with your eyes. This would allow your eyes to feel a more direct heat. Usually, to counterbalance this I place one of my arms over the heating mask to apply weight and increase the intensity of the heat.",

I have received more... for this price.\ntext: This Hair Removal Device by Ulike just as well as a couple of other IPL devices I have that cost much less. It comes packaged nicely, though I kept trying to open the flat two-sided green piece that covers the accessory side. It doesn't open.<br />The device does look quite fancy, and I was interested in skin rejuvenation, which is in one of the photos (that is mentioned in the other listing that shows this exact same device). The instruction booklet contains about as much as the empty listing page that I ordered it from. That page has no bullet points, only one photo.<br />They do have another listing for this same exact device, showing the accessories, extra photos with bits of information, and bullet points telling a little about it. I got my information from there.<br />The device does have the cooling feature, as many others do, which helps it not to zap too badly. It also comes with a razor and eye protection.<br />What it lacks, that many others include that are in or around this price range, is more attachments for the device. There needs to be at least one smaller light head for use around the lip area, as it's very hard to use the main one with the device being so large.<br />This IPL device works pretty much as well as any other, with none having the ability to make you completely hair-free at any point in the future. As far as the studies that I have seen, with diligent use, home IPL devices can only offer a little better than 50-60%-ish less hair.<br />My preferred device, which costs very little more than this one, has several attachments, including some specifically for skin rejuvenation. You do get a fancy box with this device, and it looks nice, but I don't think it provides any more or less than devices that cost much less.<br />I haven't found one yet that really only takes 10 minutes to do your legs, but if I ever do, that is the one that would probably take the cake!

The last time I was at the hair dresser I mentioned that and the hair dresser stated that the best scrunchie are these little spiral hair ties that are popping up recently. They supposedly don't cause split ends and hair breakage. I figured why not give them a shot.<br /><br />These hair ties will not get soaked if you go for a swim, obviously, which is great. I did notice however that when you just pull it out of your hair you will end up pulling out some hair. I suggest you pull it out gently, preferably by either untangling it once first or by holding your pony tail at the base firmly and then pulling it out.<br /><br />These spirals are fairly large and I like these a lot. They are blue but with a tie dye kind of effect in them, super cute. After using them for a while they can stretch out a bit, but fear not, you can just put them in warm/hot water and they shrink right back to what they used to be and your have your spiral hair tie back. Or if you just don't use them for a bit they will shrink back on their own. In this pack you only get 3 for $10 so these are bit more on the expensive side to some others I have seen and gotten.",

I stopped using my older Phillips Sonicare to use this for the past two+ weeks. The vibrations on this brush are very small and I find myself pushing the toothbrush into my teeth and scrubbing to be sure they are getting clean. Maybe there is some secret sonic vibration thing going on, but it didn't happen for me. If I didn't actually have to still 'brush my teeth' manually with this electric toothbrush, maybe it would be fine. However, it's not the case. Without manual intervention, my teeth did not feel clean. As an fyi, I stopped using it this morning and went back to my Phillips.",

            "question": "title: An Inexpensive Way to Whiter Teeth\ntext: Crest Whitestrips are one of the most popular among the store brand tooth whitening products. They were introduced to the public in 2001 and they have been satisfying customers ever since. They work by concentrating special whitening ingredients like peroxide directly against the teeth where they can penetrate the surface for a full thirty minutes. Repeated usage for fourteen days should result in significantly whiter teeth.<br /><br />Crest Whitestrips claim that these strips can be worn and used any time and that, once in place, you can go on with your normal daily routine for 30 minutes while the strips have the opportunity to work. It is true that you can do what you want, but there are certain activities that are not easy to do with one of these strips in place. I'm one of those people who has a tendency to want to move my tongue around when a have some type of dental object against my teeth and more than once, I have accidentally pushed the strips out of place. The gel helps to hold them in place but they can still be moved with little effort. Also, if you start talking with a Whitestrip in place there is a chance that some of your words will come out a little funny- like someone who has had a little too much to drink. I have found that, for best results, I try to do nothing at all when wearing Crest Whitestrips. The best thing to do is read a book. The time goes by quickly and it makes it easy to forget the strips are in place.<br /><br />Waiting for fourteen days is frustrating and it is possible that you may need a second treatment after the first, depending on how well you stick to your 30 minute per day schedule and how well the Whitestrips stayed in place. But the results should make you happy. At first I avoided Crest Whitestips because of the price and because of the product itself. Spreading liquid gel on the teeth seemed much simpler than having to wear an object against one's teeth. I didn't like the idea of hassling with strips so I avoided buying Crest Whitestrips and tried the liquid variety in its various forms first. I finally gave in and purchased Crest Whitestrips because I got tired of waiting for satisfactory results. And I did get good results with these strips. I followed the advice on the package and used the upper strips twice per day first, then the lower strips twice per day for the next seven days. This is a good idea because you can compare the shade of the top teeth with the bottom, right after the upper treatment is completed. I could see a significant difference as all those years of soda pop, coffee, tea, and other staining drinks were suddenly washed away.<br /><br />Crest Whitestrips use the same chemicals that dentist's use to clean and whiten teeth, so they are safe if used as directed. They are designed to keep teeth white for six months after each fourteen day period of usage. They also come with a money back guarantee. In order to get the guarantee. If you are not satisfied with the results, you can get a full refund of the purchase price provided you have followed the correct procedure for a refund.<br /><br />Crest Whitestrips work well, but like other over the counter whitening products, they only work on natural tooth enamel. They will not whiten dentures, caps, crowns, or other artificial dental material. If you have teeth with artificial surfaces that are badly stained, you will need to seek the help of a dentist or other professional to get rid of the problem.<br /><br />Crest Whitestrips are a little more expensive than the liquid whitening formulas but Crest Whitestrips are also more effective. I am satisfied with Crest Whitestrips and I recommend buying a box for effective treatment of discolored teeth. They are not as thorough as the treatment provided by a dentist but all things considered, these strips are a good buy. They eliminate stains and return your teeth to a more youthful appearance in only two weeks if used as directed.",

            "question": "title: THE Standard in premium shaving\ntext: I've tried at least a dozen shave soaps, maybe two dozen.  MWF is my go-to, standard. I leave it in a shave bowl in a drawer.  I rinse my brush and then swirl the dripping wet brush on top of the soap.  In about 20 seconds, you have phenomenal lather.  Wet and repeat for more water if needed. Lather around your face further as needed.  I often do this, then take a shower and repeat the lathering when I get out of the shower, and then shave.<br /><br />I have found a few artisan soaps that lather as good, but none better.  Those artisan soaps often come in a variety of delightful fragrances, but I don't care that much about fragrance.  MWF doesn't have much of any fragrance.  In fact after having wet it and let it dry a few dozen times, there is no discernible scent of any kind.  If you like the smell of MWF (or any other shave soap), keep it in a covered container between uses.  I'd suggest for those who like fragrance in their shave soap to just put MWF in a covered container and sprinkle in a little of their favorite cologne a few times and keep it covered and you'll have a $40 artisanal shave soap!<br /><br />I like the ingredients.  It's tallow based which I prefer.  There's lanolin in it which I like.  Although it's not a glycerin based soap, there is a little glycerin in the ingredients - it doesn't seem to be a large amount, so if you really like glycerin, get some vegetable glycerin on Amazon and sprinkle it on top of the soap or add it to your pre-shave.  It doesn't have shea butter in it, so I sometimes keep an open puck of shea butter shave soap in a shave dish next to MWF and occasionally reach down with my brush and lather from both.<br /><br />I've seen some reviews that say that it doesn't lather all that well in &#34;hard&#34; water.  We have moderately hard water in my city and I've never had trouble at all.<br /><br />Finally, it's cheap!  I lather before showering; after showering, and usually a second time while shaving, and my brush is full of lather when I finish and my single puck will last for maybe 300 shaves?? so maybe 4 cents a shave??<br /><br />Also,",

It cleans and exfoliates while it also hydrates my skin. When I get out of the tub or shower I don‚Äôt have to apply lotion to my body because the scrub left my skin completely moisturized.<br /><br />The sugar in this product does the job of exfoliating and making the skin fresh and new. The oil in the product does the moisturizing, much better than just a lotion after because it really coats the skin.<br /><br />There will be some residue left in the tub or shower that has to be rinsed with really hot water when done or it will be slippery for the next shower or bath.<br /><br />Definitely a recommend for anyone that understands what this product is.",

It has a natural look to it with a 4-fork tip head that lets you create more realistic looking brows. This gets 3 stars for its wearability and durability and application. The formula goes on quite dry so you really have to work in applying yet so it looks even on both brows. However, I like the color and the fork applicator.

They are packaged very compactly, making them easy to take along in a gym bag, backpack or even in your pocket. The packet is soft, which means it's not ideal for dispensing one wipe at a time without some measure of struggle. There's an adhesive flap to cover the opening, but again, as with pretty much any packet with this design, the flap doesn't do nearly as good of a job as a hard plastic cover.<br /><br />The wipe material is soft but pretty durable. It's designed to be a \"prep\" before using a stick-on breathing strip on your nose. As such, it doesn't do all that good of a job. While it does contain witch hazel, there's too little of it for the wipe to perform well. Witch hazel is the last ingredient (after water, glycerin, and aloe). Witch hazel is a great prep for any adhesive to ensure a good skin bond. Using these wipes is really no better for that task than plain water.<br /><br />While it is a comfortable wipe to use for general face and hand cleaning, given the price and the lack of unique benefits re: better adhesion, I see this as a 3 star (average) product at best.

This looked like a really great product.  Let's take a look..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This comes in a nice box, well packed in a fancy presentation and comes with a little manual.  The device has four buttons on it which are power, temp up or temp down or timer.  The bent curling iron is supposed to be more handy to use.<br /><br />MANUAL<br />The manual is bare bones.  It looks fancy but never tells what temperature or time would be good to start with for different types of hair.  That was very disappointing.  It does tell how to basically press the buttons and what they are for, however.<br /><br />HOW DID THIS PERFORM?<br />We tried this several times on various occasions.  Each time, we set the temperature higher and higher until we were at the top temp but very few of the curls we tried making worked.  The hair simply had a light bend in it.  When using a different curling iron with each person, the hair looked great.  Finally after trying for the last time today, we have determined that this curling iron just does not work.  I am not sure if we got a bad one or what, but it just does not do hardly anything except leaving a partial bend in the hair no matter how we wind it.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Although a great concept, this curling iron did not seem to curl hair properly no matter what hair we used it on or how high or low the temperature was set.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />TWO STARS.

I do find this Booster oil a little heavier than some other facial oil blends, but it doesn‚Äôt bother me as I tend to use facial oil blends of this type at night, and my skin is dry enough that I can use this during the day. I just have to be careful not to apply too much. When I add a little oil to my cream, I get extra moisture and the oil makes my skin feel soft and look dewy.<br /><br />This Booster has a high percentage of squalane (about 44%). It‚Äôs one of my favorite ingredients as it adds extra moisture to my dry skin and makes my skin smooth and soft. For daytime, I do have 100% squalane that I tend to prefer to this Booster oil just because it‚Äôs so lightweight yet gives me that extra moisture and softness. But I‚Äôd rather use like the the Booster oil blend at night as it has additional ingredients beyond squalane that add benefits, such as antioxidant and fatty acid rich sunflower seed oil.<br /><br />At night, I‚Äôve tried this Booster oil various ways. I‚Äôve applied it after cleansing and toning but would rather use a regular serum. I‚Äôve mixed it with my night cream and have also applied after my cream. I feel there‚Äôs no right or wrong way, but I like it best added after my night cream as I can use all my regular products yet I also get an extra boost of antioxidants and moisture that can soak protect and nourish my skin all night. I like waking up to skin that still feels hydrated and comfortable.<br /><br />I‚Äôm impressed that this Booster oil emphasizes natural and gentle ingredients, and it also lacks chemical fragrance. I do smell a hint of lavender oil. It can be an irritant form some and can give me headaches if it‚Äôs too strong. Luckily, it‚Äôs subtle enough not to cause an issue. In fact, this Booster oil doesn‚Äôt cause any irritation to my sensitive skin at all. Like it a lot. 4.5 stars. Made in Canada.",

I didn‚Äôt read that at first and applied too much making the smell over powering. If you use the appropriate amount, the smell is not too strong. It helps keep you fresh smelling all day! Keep in mind this does not have anti-perspirant in it so it will allow you to sweat. However, it should help prevent odor. I like the fact that this is aluminum free, paraben free, toxin free and petroleum free. it is also free of imitation perfumes.<br /><br />So far, I like using this product but need to put it to a test on a hot humid day while exercising! If that does the trick, I will update my review to five stars. The weather in my area is very stormy, so I am unable to give this a full testing!

I have used these twice now around the holidays when I've been worn out. These comma-shaped masks are easy enough to apply - there is a little spatula thing to help lift them out in order to be sanitary. They have a wet, silicone-like feel that is very similar to the feel of a contact lens, only thicker. I found that they stuck to my skin fairly well, even when I was moving around. The mask felt nice on and was a bit cooling after awhile. The area under my eyes felt refreshed after using these, although I didn't actually notice anything visibly different. These might be worth it if you are simply looking to make your eye area feel better.",

Great customer service. 5 stars‚≠ê\ntext: This Belle polygel kit is a great starter set¬†from beginner to expert levels. It has some beautiful neutral colors, along with a white, and gorgeous glitters. They are all half ounce size tubes that will create a few sets of nails each, or you can mix and match the colors to make them go farther.<br />This kit includes; Six .5 oz. polygel colors, primer,¬†gel¬†base and top coats, a nail strengthener, cuticle oil, slip solution, dual forms, polygel brush with spatula, nail clips, and alcohol wipes. It comes nicely packaged in a lovely black box with cutouts to hold everything in place.<br />At minimum, you¬†will need to supply your nail prep¬†and finishing tools and liquids, such as: cuticle pusher and possibly nippers, a buffer, and nail dehydrator/alcohol, but these are things you will want to keep in good supply, anyways.<br />This¬†polygel is so easy to work with. It is not too hard nor too soft. It's very easily workable with the provided slip solution. Even a beginner will have no trouble using it. Just remember, that if your surrounding temperature gets too cold or too hot, it affects the viscosity of the polygel, so work in a room that feels nice.<br />I did two nail swatches; one solid glitter and the other a French manicure with a shimmery twist. As I said, the polygel applied so easily, it also cured as expected without any problems, and the end results turned out beautiful.<br />I have to say that when I received my Belle polygel kit, there was a small¬†issue with my order. I contacted their customer service and was met with such kindness and prompt service. They answered all my questions very quickly and respectfully. They're promptness in solving my¬†problem, and their patience in dealing with my questions, shows me that they really care about their customers. Knowing that they were not privy to my customer status lets me know that they will treat all customers the same.<br />The colors are all so beautiful, and the glitters really make a statement. This set would make a great addition to anyone's collection and would also make a wonderful gift. Knowing this polygel kit is also backed by Belle, a wonderful company who really values their customers, makes a great product even better. I would most definitely recommend it!",

            "question": "title: High Molecular Weight is the Real King!\ntext: I had been using High Molecular Weight HA for a couple of weeks on my face/ hair with nice moisturizing results. But at some point I read on beauty blogs and publications that since Low Molecular Weight HA is better absorbed through the skin, that it was a much better option for the face. Made sense to me. Because of this I bought a LMW HA serum to put on my skin. This serum felt differently, watery yet more drying that the HMW HA (HMW can initially feel a bit drying on the skin). My face also felt irritated ( I have acne-prone skin) after the first days of using it. I still decided to buy this powder and the results very similar to the serum I bought.<br /><br />So I decided to do some research on the difference between both, the HMW and the LMW, because I could not understand why the LMW, which is supposed to be a far better option for the skin (according to the beauty industry) , did not give me the good results I have with the HMW. Interestingly enough I found this: &#34;Transepidermal water loss increased by 55.5% with low-molecular weight , and was reduced by 28% with crosslinked resilient , and by 16% with HMW&#34;. So more water loss with LMW? Not good.<br /><br />I also noted this: &#34;There is abundant experimental evidence from the human physiology and biochemistry literature to support the basic notion that LMW-HA is inflammatory, pro-fibrotic, and associated with adult scarring phenotypes rather than fetus-like, scar-free, truly regenerative healing.  The latter is what we want in an any aesthetic procedure, or topical adjunct to a procedure, or just for topical use.&#34; This part here may explain why my face felt irritated and even got a mild breakout after using the LMW HA. More info on this on Barefacedtruth. They have detailed explanation and comments on this.<br /><br />I did give this product a 3-star because it is nicely packaged, has the detailed info on the product, etc. 2 stars down for being marketed as a potent moisturizer.",

            "question": "title: Nice strong scent at first, but it disappears very quickly.\ntext: I really loved the idea of this Boiess Baby Cologne \"Les Enfants\" in White Blossom, and thought it would be perfect for myself since I don't like loud fragrances. The description of the scent profile really enticed me, as I love all of the notes. I was able to try both the White Blossom and the Lavanda scents.<br />Both of the \"Cologne\"¬†sprays smell identical to me. I can't say that I can tell them apart at all. They both have a very strong earthy, herbal, slightly floral scent that is heavily ladened with alcohol upon spraying. It stays very strong for several minutes, but then starts to dry down.<br />Sadly, once it dries down, the scent pretty much dissipates. If I don't spray it heavily at first, which is too much for my asthma to handle, the scent just goes away completely. I must spray it on me again. Once I spray it on a few times over an hour or¬†so, I can smell the ever so slightest hint of it on my clothing later, if I put¬†my¬†nose right on it. That is a lot of spraying for very little payoff.<br />I know this is meant for kids mostly, but I would think the scent would and should last longer. Sure, my grandsons will like using it, maybe, as it is quite strong at first. But, I think it would just be more for the fun of it and very short lived.¬†This is also very expensive \"Cologne\" to not be able to smell it after 30 minutes, and right at $28 is too expensive for me to buy just for the fun of it. ¬†<br />For others this \"Baby Cologne\" may be something¬†wonderful or maybe they can smell it more than I can. As I said, I really love the idea of a light fragrance, but not for babies. I do wish the scent stuck around more for me.",

Ever since I purchased this palette, it has been my go-to for everyday makeup. I am fair-skinned with dark hair and hazel eyes, and the colors are perfect. I don't always use every color in a palette and I don't always place the colors as directed, but in this case, Stila knows what they are talking about!<br /><br />The large color on the left is your all-over base, and I apply that first. Next, I go to the top right corner and apply this grayish color from crease to browbone. Third, I take the darkest color and place it quite heavily (but narrowly) in the crease and a little in the corner and lash line. Next, I put the highlight (lightest) color just under the brow and also outside the inner corner of the eye. Finally, I put the shimmery gold-like color in the middle across the lid and blend all the colors with a blending brush. I use the darker blush normally, but use the light one as a highlight if I want the added effect. I love that when I am doing my makeup on the run, I only have to grab this one container and my makeup brushes (I have the EcoTools Eye Enhancing Duo Brush set with four tips on two brushes, so even there you don't have to take as much with you).<br /><br />The quality of the product is excellent and it blends well. Other than the darkest brown, the eyeshadow pigments are not super intense, so you can go light or apply more for a deeper intensity.",

            "question": "title: Patience required\ntext: I‚Äôve been trying out a couple of different lash serums over the past month. With my husband also using it (on his brows), while I use it on my lashes, we‚Äôve been able to try different brands to see if there are any differences in results. This serum, by Kimuse, is very similar to the others in consistency (a thin liquid) and in how it‚Äôs applied (with a very thin brush). I have had no negative reactions to the serum, and no irritation to my eyes even when I‚Äôve slipped and gotten some in my eye. This serum boasts results in as little as 3-4 weeks, while most others are more conservative at 6 weeks. In the few weeks we‚Äôve been using the serums, neither of us have noticed any dramatic changes as far as lash or brow growth, but I do think I‚Äôm losing fewer lashes which is a definite plus. Honestly, I‚Äôm not sure if any serum is going to provide dramatic results, but we‚Äôll continue for at least a few more weeks and see what happens while hoping for the best.Hopefully, I‚Äôll be back with exciting news!<br /><br />Update: After using this, as well as other, lash growth serums for several months, I have noticed a definite improvement in the length of my lashes. I have not noticed as significant an improvement in the thickness, or volume, of my lashes, however. I believe that these types of serums do help promote growth, and I haven't been able to detect much difference between brands except that a couple of them irritated my eyes. Therefore, my conclusion is that this is helpful and the real determination of what works best will be what's most comfortable for you to use, so read the ingredients and watch for any possible allergy triggers or irritants.",

This was my first time trying a roller and gua sha, and I didn‚Äôt really know what to expect because I was a little skeptical that they‚Äôd work as well as everyone says. But, I was proven wrong! My favorite of the two is the gua sha - it really improved the circulation in my face (as far as I could see and feel) and I really do believe it reduced inflammation on my face. My skin is less red and less irritated. It feels really good too. As for the roller, I don‚Äôt use it as often, but I do find it helpful. I use it to rub oil onto my face and the cool sensation of the quartz feels good. I‚Äôve been using this with a face oil and my face has been quite hydrated, which is great for the dry winter months.

I received the holographic powder this afternoon and just finished my nails about 5 minutes ago. This is NOT a nail dip powder like Revel. The tiny small jar will probably do at least 100 nails based on the amount I just used for 10 fingers . Steps- You do your gel nails exactly like you always do them, and after your topcoat is cured, you take the eyeshadow applicator, barely dip it into the powder, and buff it over your nail like you are putting on eyeshadow but rub it in really well like blending. You do NOT dip your finger into the powder. You do NOT put it on your wet nail You put It on the dry topcoat, and buff it in, wipe off the excess with a dry brush or a cotton ball, then do another topcoat and cure that. The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because I am not sure how it will wear. I will update my review later. Please look at the online directions for this and don‚Äôt be stupid! I used several different colors of polish to test it out, and it even works over just the clear. I am going to try it with regular nail polish later and see how it works with that.",

I'd previously tried their pimple patches and sheet masks but this $45 set is geared towards an older, more skincare oriented client.  The packaging is giftable with six items for layering skin care (the English list of ingredients are on the plastic wrap).  I found the products light and easily absorbed into the skin. I have sensitive combination skin and they worked well for me. They cleansed without stripping my skin and hydrated without being overly strong.  I experienced no redness, sensitivity or irritation while using any of the products.",

The gray is a medium shade with a smooth finish that won‚Äôt pick up hairs and dust. The pink is a metallic magenta that really pops.<br /><br />The speed controls are on the handle. The slide button doesn‚Äôt move easily, so there‚Äôs not a big chance of accidentally changing the speed/temperature without meaning to. On the back of the handle is the option for either cool or hot temperature.<br /><br />The hair dryer doesn‚Äôt dry my hair any faster than any other hair dryer I‚Äôve used. But I like that I can set the temperature to cool to lessen damage and not have to hold in a cool shot button.<br /><br />The hair dryer isn‚Äôt as lightweight as some plastic models I‚Äôve used, but it‚Äôs weighted pretty well. The weight of it is distributed evenly on both sides of the handle.<br /><br />The attachments have little tabs that line up with notches on the nozzle, and then you twist them to lock them in place. I like it -- there‚Äôs less chance of them popping off while I use the hair dryer.<br /><br />The bottom of the hair dryer says the rated power is 1800 watt, which is contrary to the description which says it is 2000 watt.",

Both of them are sulfate free which is great, however when I read the ingredients it turns out that the shampoo actually has silicone in it, not a fan of that. Thankfully the conditioner does not seem to have any in it.<br /><br />So the shampoo is not bad. The scent is decent, nothing spectacular though just ok in my eyes. It produces a nice lather that rinses out easily. What I do not like is the fact that it has silicone in it.<br /><br />The conditioner in my eyes is much nicer. The big problem is, the pump dispenser does not work. The conditioner is just too thick and can not be pumped up for some reason. So the suggestion of another reviewer to switch the lids is not a bad one. The conditioner smells much nicer than the shampoo and produces a very nice soft feel on your hair while still wet. It also rinses out nicely.<br /><br />When your hair is dry it does look and feel very nice. So in combination your hair does look nice when you use this combination, just not sure I am a huge fan of the shampoo in this set. All in all this gets a 3 star for me since the conditioner is pretty good, the shampoo is just below average in my eyes. As a set it may be just a tad overpriced though.",

That being said, it really did enhance my C cup breasts and give me cleavage that I never had before unless I used one of those super padded push up bras. I'd also like to mention that I have very sensitive skin and because this cream is made out of 100% all natural herbs, I had no adverse reaction or side effects at all!<br /><br />I used this cream, which basically has no scent, twice a day and within a few days, I was seeing positive results. My 45 year old breasts are no longer on the saggy side. It really perked up the girls! All it took was 5 minutes to thoroughly massage this cream onto my breasts, being careful to avoid my nipples. This cream comes with a very detailed set of instructions on how to massage it onto your breasts, which actually felt very relaxing.<br /><br />I was offered this product at a slightly reduced price in exchange for honest evaluation and review. It is my honest opinion that this cream does indeed deliver the desired results that women my age want.

Especially when things are stressful or it's just that time of the month. I had some friends tell me that mud masks are especially helpful for this, but that they are also good for exfoliating and keeping skin healthy. I tried using some bentonite clay as it says you  can use it as a mud mask, but it ended up clumpy and hard to spread on my face. I always ended up making too much too, which only wasted it. It was too much trouble and I stopped using it. I decided to give the dead sea mud mask a go. It is much darker than I expected, my entire face was blue/grey. It's very easy to spread on, I just used one finger and small swisp on each section of my face. It doesn't take too much, I figured it would take a big scoop, but really it took much less. I have used it three times already, each before bed, and you can't even see a dent in how much was in the jar. I left it on about 10 minutes each time and then wiped it off with a wet wash cloth. My skin feels softer, is not breaking out, and my husband even noticed a difference.<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT TO TRY IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.

I kept these securely on my feet for the directed amount of time and then took them off and took a shower.

The predominant scent (and minor, initial flavor) is that of seaweed, since that it the primary ingredient. It doesn't come back up in burps like a fish oil can.<br /><br />I have been taking this for 2 weeks now. I did not immediately start with a full 2 caps does as I wanted to make sure that I could tolerate the new ingredients. I can. So then about a week in I began taking two caps. I know I have forgotten a dose or two, but I am through 2 of the six blister packs, and just starting my third. I am embarking on a multi pronged approach to my massive shedding cycles. I used to have incredibly crazy thick hair and over the past 10 years or so, it has greatly reduced. My hair grows fine (it is nearly waist length) but the hairs are thinner, and the overall volume on my scalp has reduced. While we all naturally shed, the amount that comes out when I am in a shedding cycle is depressing. I hope to reduce the frequency and amount of loss. SO, I am taking supplements, starting some new DHT blocking shampoo and conditioner, adding in a scalp treatment.. etc. This supplement is all together different than what I have been taking, so I am extra hopeful for its effectiveness. It am currently either in an \"off shedding cycle\", or my approach is working. I don't want to claim yet that this is working as I think the benchmark for noted improvement is 3 weeks. BUT I'm not too far off, so maybe?! I am keeping track, so I will be back to update as I go. Currently, I feel fine taking this, and it never makes me feel nauseous.<br /><br /> It is a 60 capsule (30 day) supply. Easy to pop out blister packs of 10 capsules, 6 blister packs total in a cardboard container. The pills are a typical sized basic soft capsules that could be opened up and added to food or drink.  Acquired 08/2020, it has expiry date of 02/2021.<br /><br />From my knowledge of Ashwagandha, if you have hyperthyroidism, you may want to avoid this herb, where as if you have hypothyroidism (me!) it can be a helpful herb to use.<br /><br />Suggested daily use: take 2 capsules with a glass of water.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS  1 CAP  2 CAPS<br />-Brown Seaweed (Ascophyllum nodosum) extract  100 mg  200 mg<br />(increase hair mineralisation, which leads to thicker hair)<br /><br />-Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) extract  170 mg  340 mg<br />(improve scalp circulation and strengthen the hair, possibly reverse grays)<br /><br />-Triphala extract*  170 mg  340 mg<br />(repairs damaged hair and increases hair volume)<br />* (Emblica officinalis, Terminalia bellerica, Terminalia chebula, 1:1:1)<br /><br />-Korean Ginseng (Panax ginseng) extract  20 mg  40 mg<br />(strengthens the hair follicles with optimum nutrition, thereby reducing hair fall to a large extent and stimulating healthy hair growth)<br /><br />-Fleeceflower (Fallopia multflora) extract  30 mg  60 mg<br />(helps stimulate the growth stage in hair follicles)<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Notes:<br />--Seanergix 4 New Hair is not effective in cases of Male Pattern Baldness (baldness due to generic reasons).<br />-- Not recommended for pregnant women.<br /><br />From their webpage:<br /><br />The combination creates one of the best and strongest Natural products to prevent hair loss and regrowth hair.<br /> --After 3 weeks of using Seanergix 4 New Hair it will be visible that the hair is in process of reduction in hair falling.<br />-- After 3 months of using Seanergix 4 New Hair almost 40% of new/regrowth hair will be seen!!!<br />-- After 6 months of using Seanergix 4 New Hair the reduction in hair loss is almost stopped while the hair growth continues to regrow.<br /><br />This is one of those things that if you see it working, you will want to continue with it. Upfront expectation to really know if it is working seems to be around 3 months-- which would be true of any product of this nature.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />EDIT: Within the one full pack of use (some skipped doses), I can tell there is less hair fall. This makes the first benchmark accurate. \"After 3 weeks of using Seanergix 4 New Hair it will be visible that the hair is in process of reduction in hair falling\". Possible that I was ending a shedding phase, but I have indeed experienced reduced shedding while taking this product.<br /><br />It is because of this that I decided to KEEP GOING with it. Going forward.. For me to be able to tell the second benchmark has been met, \"After 3 months.. almost 40% of new/regrowth.. will be seen\" I will need to continue to buy this.  So I know I will actually need at least 2 more to be able to tell if this second benchmark is accurate. I may be awhile, but I will continue to update. (and of course, if it does actually work, then I will be continuing this for quite some time).",

Each bottle has a cap but a pump accompanies each bottle as well. I much prefer the pumps for oils since they are thinner and it can be difficult to control a pour. During the winter months I use these oils as skin moisturizers. When still damp from a shower, I rub the oil on my skin and it moisturizes much better than any type of lotion that I have tried.<br /><br />These oils also make wonderful body scrubs using essential oils for scent and sugar or salt for the exfoliating. Using the scrubs also helps to moisturize.<br /><br />I found the oils to be fresh, no sign of a rancid smell. They both come in an amber colored bottle which is the best way to store them.<br /><br />Just in case you are not familiar with these types of oils, they are not scented. Neither oil has any type of scent at all and they are meant to be used as moisturizing products or carrier oils.<br /><br />Overall: really nice set of oils that are fresh and in the right type of bottle.",

The purpose of a BBB is not to detangle; it is to stimulate the scalp, spread sebum throughout your length, and use as a finishing brush. One should use a detangle brush or comb before brushing with a BBB. I use the GranNatuarals Boar Bristle Brush in the morning and at night, and I never use it on wash days.  It is not a brush to use on wet hair.  So, if you know this about a BBB, this is an excellent choice in BBB.<br /><br />Also, the weight and shape of this brush make an excellent hair brush paddle choice.<br /><br />I highly recommend this brush on both counts.",

In real life it looks runny and sticky, but is surprisingly easy to work with.  After applying a long bead of the gel with the included brush, I pushed the gel to my desired shape, and then let it self level to smooth itself out.  On both thick and thin layers very little effort was required on my part.  In fact, if I tried to get the shape perfect with the brush, the gel got stickier and messier, so I quickly learned to let the gel smooth itself out.  Tip: once you get your shape all smoothed out, turn your nail upside down and let gravity create a natural apex before popping it under the lamp. So far I‚Äôve only used the clear gel.  I created on extension (not shown), attached rhinestones to several pride nails, and fully encapsulated a fully covered rhinestone nail.  1 thick layer of this hard gel and a have encased rhinestones that fully cured in just over 2 minutes!  I also plan to use this for simple overlays when my nail need additional support.

Each product pouch contains plenty of hydrating essence, and each of the two included sheet masks folds out to make a quarter moon shape. It is definitely a bit challenging to try and place them by yourself, since it requires trying to twist your body around to see a mirror, but they‚Äôd be super easy to ‚Äúseat‚Äù properly if you had an extra hand.<br /><br />I will say that they do cling fairly well, and the essence feels nourishing, but the sheets ripple quickly with minor motions or movement. If you‚Äôre standing when you place them and then lie down on your stomach, they shift around and lose some of their clinging magnetism, causing little ridges and ripples in the cloth that are no longer in firm contact with the skin. Upon removal, the remaining liquid essence does easily absorb, so I didn‚Äôt experience any post-use stickiness or unpleasant residue, but I‚Äôm not entirely convinced the panthenol is a wonder ingredient.<br /><br />I‚Äôm sure the amino acid solution does firm, tone, and moisturize the skin to a certain degree, but it‚Äôs hard to really ascertain that after just one application, and since each pouch contains just one pair of treatment sheets, more of them would be required to determine if any noticeable benefits accumulated over time. Overall, I think this is an intriguing novelty item that many consumers might find humorous, so for that reason alone, I think it‚Äôs worth giving these a try!",

It's white, and even though I'm fair, I felt this needed a very light application. The good news is if such a thin dusting can live up to the reviews, it makes the price a little better.

I'd rate this one some where in the middle of the pack. I'm glad to see that the price has come down from the $40 price tag it was when I was initially sent a bottle at a discounted price simply to provide my experience and opinion about this product. It does have some wonderful ingredients and I appreciate the generous size bottle and the fact that the print isn't too small to read both on the box and the bottle. Thank you for that. I also like that it's paraben free, not tested on animals, contains no dyes or fragrances and is made in America. I don't like that it contains Alcohol. It is on the bottom of the ingredient list but I'm thinking that it's needed to combat the stickiness. It does a great job at waking up tired eyes. Within minutes, fine lines fill in as this product seems to plump up your skin. Where I find it to be a problem is that I have to follow it up with another eye cream to lose the stickiness before applying makeup. On days when I don't wear makeup, it's not a problem. Probably because it has more time to penetrate the skin. Overall, it's a nice product that is now priced right.",

I am a little older than my fiance but I didn't want my face to show it on my special day. I take the best care of my skin to try to keep it as youthful as possible, so when I had the opportunity to try this serum, I was happy to do so. The serum comes in a screw top and eye dropper dispenser. The bottle is a dark amber colored glass bottle. There is one fluid ounce in the bottle. The serum has a sort of medicinal scent, not unpleasant and not too strong. It leave behind no real scent once it absorbs in. The serum feels refreshing and absorbs quickly and thoroughly into my skin. I feel an immediate pleasant tightening effect and the skin looks smooth and supple almost immediately. I've been using the stone crop serum for two weeks which is not really enough time to be able to tell the full effect of the serum on fine lines and wrinkles, but I do notice softening in expression lines in my forehead and in fine lines and that my skin stays better hydrated throughout the day. There is no burning, redness or irritation with the use of the serum and no product residue left behind. The manufacturer offers a 100% Money-Back Guarantee which I appreciate but have never had a problem with Eva Naturals products before. I am enjoying the serum and consider it a good value at under 19.00 delivered to my door and by the fact that a little goes a long way with only one dropper full of serum enough to do my entire face.",

In the pack you get 4 masks for about $15, so almost $4 per mask, not the cheapest but also not the most expensive I have used to date.<br /><br />The masks are very easy to use. They come individually wrapped and are folded nicely. The material of these is not the softest I have used but they work. They smell REALLY nice however, a nice gentle floral with some other tones mixed in, very nice. You use these for about 15 to 20 minutes or so and gently rub the remainder of the mask into your skin.<br /><br />When I was done my skin felt pretty soft over. This mask is nice but it is not my favorite. My skin also had a nice residual scent left from the mask which I did enjoy. I would have expected a little better for the price since I have used cheaper masks that were nicer. All in all these are pretty nice though.",

I love the scent -- it's a light, \"fresh\" scent that is sort of floral and sort of botanical. Normally I prefer unscented (or something that just smells soapy) but this light scent is quite enjoyable. It's a thick cream that resembles a moisturizer more so than a soap.<br /><br />There's virtually no lather to it. It foams up a bit, but very lightly. It's a very gentle soap but, for me, it's a bit too gentle in that I don't have a clean feeling after using it. My face feels more like I've applied a moisturizer. That's not a bad thing, especially in the dry winter months, but I want to have a clean-feeling face after using a face soap, and I don't get it from this.<br /><br />Balancing the positive and negative features puts my rating at three stars (average). It smell great and it is very gentle, but it's not a face soap I'd get again. There are other gentle soaps that also offer better cleaning and a better value on a cost per ounce basis.",

Also, for famillies, all you have to do is buy more heads because everyone can use this.  And this thing is totally pain free, in fact it tickles your mouth, but you will most certainly look forward to brushing.  The three speeds are very nice, plus if you follow the directions and brush in quarters, it has a bit of a hesitation to let you know when to move onto the next quarter.

But that's the price you pay for larger curls so it's FINE with me, and I will sleep in it. It also comes with four satin scrunchies- two large to hold  the ends when it's done, and two small for wrapping your ends. I don't quite understand the prickly clips for root volume.

A word of caution when you assemble it, attach the rods to the bottom piece first, then when you attach the top piece, make sure that the holes line up before you attach the top screws. They don't all line up on every set of holes. I had to undo it and reattach it to get the top and bottom slots to line up correctly! Once I did, it works beautifully. It would be nice if the bottom holes were a little deeper to hold the bigger brushes better. A little tab to pull the protective plastic would be nice too, I was afraid of scratching it while I was trying to get the protective film off! Overall it's well worth the price and I'm glad I bought it. It holds my brushes and looks very nice. UPDATE: while this looks like a nice brush hokder. It's not very practical for everyday use. The slightest touch will move the brush out of its holder. The bottom holes don't hold the brushes securely. My brushes are constantly falling over and sliding into the holder.  I wouldn't buy it again, already looking for a new holder. I'll probably go with a regular style brush holder, as long as they aren't falling all over the place!",

It's made in Korea, home to many high qualty skin care companies so I trust its quality (more so than if it's from China!).<br /><br />Again, I love the bottle so I'll be sure to re-use it after the body wash is all gone, but if I had to do it again, I'd choose a different scent.

Lots of bubbles, no scent that I could detect and an easy to use dispenser. The body wash/shampoo is fine as a body wash and I love the foam dispenser. It works ok for an infant as shampoo but I don‚Äôt like it as shampoo for a toddler with more hair. The wipes are great and I like the small package so they stay moist longer. The lotion is quite thin as most baby lotion is so you have to be careful when opening or dispensing it because you can find yourself with way more than you wanted very quickly. I also could not discern any scent on the lotion. The oil I only use to pour just a tad into a bath so soften and moisten the skin. You do have to be careful not to put too much in or the tub will become a slip and slide.<br /><br />Overall: Nice products, not perfect but would make a nice gift, comes in a gift box.",

And 2 compliments from friends after using it for 1 week\ntext: I bought this to begin (and win!) the fight against the wrinkles that are appearing around my eyes (crow's feet). I guess the best solution is not to laugh, but then what fun would life be...<br /><br />What is Hyaluronic acid? According to WebMD, &#34;Hyaluronic acid works by acting as a cushion and lubricant in the joints and other tissues. In addition, it might affect the way the body responds to injury.&#34;<br /><br />(+) Does it work? I've used the Hyaluronic serum every night for a week now. Not sure if I can say 100% that I have noticed no fine lines around my eyes, but I've had 2 friends remark that my skin is looking great. As we women know, that's a good endorsement right there.<br /><br />(+) Texture: As you can see in the photo, the Derma-nu serum is a clear, slightly viscous consistency that goes on clear. You can feel it on your skin for quite a few minutes afterwards. It does NOT leave your skin feeling greasy (big pet peeve of mine) when you wake up in the morning.<br /><br />(+) Smell: This is not a scented beauty product. There is a very slight almost medicinal scent - that's the best way to describe it. It is not unpleasant, it is extremely mild, but it smells like it has some ingredients that 'have a purpose', vs. beauty products that have fragrances added.<br /><br />(+) Packaging and ease of use: The pump is well made - it dispenses a small amount of serum, which I am finding is enough for applying to the corners of both eyes. I'm having to &#34;prime&#34; the pump about 2-3 times before it dispenses the serum, so be careful, you don't want to double pump the serum unless you are OK putting possibly 2x the amount on your face than you might have intended.<br /><br />(+) A little goes a long way. I travel a lot, so the compact bottle and efficient dispensing from the pump are bonuses for me.<br /><br />(/) Organic. The bottle indicates that 72% of the ingredients are organic. It doesn't clarify which of the ingredients are/are not organic. It would be nice to see this get to 100%.<br /><br />Bottom line: So far, my skin has felt good, I've had a few compliments, and I'm pleased with the way Derma-nu packaged the Hyaluronic serum so that it is easy to dispense.<br /><br />*I received the serum for evaluation and review",

The only one this diffuser worked with was the Conair.  Unless you have a BIO IONIC dryer you run the risk that this item will not fit your dryer.<br /><br />When I finally found a dryer that worked with this diffuser, the diffuser worked well.  This diffuser is very well made compared to the diffusers that come with most dryers.  First, it's larger than typical diffusers.  Second, it swivels to open and close the air vents.  I find that it's best used when my hair is nearly dry to put the finishing touches on.  I was a bit skeptical of what a diffuser would offer at this price point, but I think the build quality warrants the price.<br /><br />Overall, I proceed with caution when ordering this product unless you have the BIO IONIC.  If you do own the BIO IONIC, this item is fantastic and I highly recommend it.",

            "question": "title: excellent sunscreen with skin loving ingredients, broad spectrum, great little container\ntext: The \"Drop the Bomb\" BBOSONG Suns stick uses one of THEE best UVA/UVB sunscreen ingredients on the planet: \"Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine\"! Say that 5 times fast. Or once. lol. It is a broad spectrum, highly photo stable, chemical sunscreen. Chemical sunscreens mean that they absorb rays and disperse as heat before they can reach skin and do damage. The SPF rating of 50+ and PA++++ means that it offers the highest amount of protection that a sunscreen can offer.<br /><br />Korean skin care, particularly sunscreens, can use super effective ingredients that products made in (or for) USA can not have because the governing bodies have not approved it. It is not because they are unsafe, but because there is a significant amount of bureaucracy involved. No new sunscreen ingredients have been approved in the USA in over 15 years, sad since there are so many wonderful innovations in the rest of the world. We lag greatly behind. Fortunately, we can still buy these products.<br /><br />The other sunscreen used in this product is, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Octinoxate)- a less stellar chemical sunscreen that has mixed thoughts on its efficacy, safety, and desirability. It protects only against UVB rays and breaks down when exposed to light (10% per 30-40 minutes). However, when combined with another broad spectrum sunscreen, it compliments it very well.<br /><br />The third sunscreen component is, Octocrylene.  Screens out the UVB and somewhat in the UVA II range. It is quite photostable (loses 10% of SPF protection in 95 mins) and is often used to stabilize other photo-unstable UV-filters (octinoxate) It is also often used to improve the water resistance of the products.<br /><br />As for all the other ingredients- primarily stabilizers, viscosity controlling ingredients, hardeners-- basically all ingredients that make it a STICK than can glide onto the skin. It is formulated to melt into the skin on contact, and yet absorb thoroughly. Basically, you won't even know it is there.<br /><br />And like so many other Korean skin care items, there are ingredients that go above and beyond the basic sunscreen-- included are skin loving ingredients (emollients, skin conditioners, soothers) such as Japanese knotweed, water lily, gotu kola (centella asiatica), camellia japonica, Lespedeza Capitata Extract (anti inflammatory), scutellaria (ie scullcap/mint), green tea, licorice, rosemary, chamomile<br /><br />Has a super mild scent- clean, fresh almost like a deodorant, but subtle.<br /><br />Happens to be a in a container that reminds me of deodorant. Super small, cute. Stick in a pocket or purse. I happen to love using it on my hands. I am in my 40s, and while I have been using SPF most of my life on my face, I figured it was high time to remember to put some on my hands. I like keeping this in my purse or my car, and applying it when I go to drive. That seems to be the time that my hands are most consistently exposed to the sun. Figure, hands on the steering wheel and in front of a big window. So yeh, this is perfect for that.<br /><br />I have no problem using this on my face.  Doesn't grab skin when used over a moisturizer. If need be can be applied/emulsified in palms then patted on. I prefer it as my \"reapply\" SPF rather than my first application product (I am used to a cream style). When I do apply it to my face, I always run it over my lips. It is very silky, doesnt have a sunscreen flavor or feel, and it is adding much needed hydration and protection from the sun.<br /><br /> Again, I am in my 40s.. clear fair skin but with Rosacea (non acne- just redness and visible veins). Leans dry. Loves Korean skin care.<br /><br />This is so clear, so clean feeling, and so incredibly light that I wish I could show you how it doesn't even feel like anything is on. Not greasy, not even dewy. My skin feels bare.<br /><br />If I have any complaints, it is the use of fragrance. While it smells nice and doesn't really linger.. it would not make a top choice for use on my face. I do however like it for everywhere else and rather enjoy the light scent before it dissipates fully.<br /><br />Even so, it is a really good product, so far. If I experience anything else, I will be back to say so.<br /><br />For all the other ingredients, the each rate 1-2 (very low in terms of hazard to self or environment) on EWG Skin Deep Database.",

When it comes down to it, I do get a nice shave from this Fusion (late model?), and I agree with so many smart shoppers when they mention the price on these things (the blades) is ridiculously high. This package was a very nice deal and I wanted an extra razor, which looks very nice on the Limited Edition, and the extra 2 Cartridges that came along with it. I bought not too long ago the Limited Edition Coast Guard of this same brand, and that one I really dig.<br />In my case I have always found that I replace the blades every 8 uses, and I like the safe way they are designed, but still it is advisable to shave carefully when using sharp blades. 4 Stars!",

But, as cool as they are, it's hard to maneuver in your mouth. The end tip is wide, to accommodate the wrap around bristles, and when I brush (and other family members) the large end tip hits into your back gums when you try to get the back teeth.  Maybe with more use I will be able to handle it better.  But I don't know if that's even possible with the end tip the way it is.  Of note: in the center of the two brush sides is another little brush, for the tops of teeth.  I don't know if it's sufficient in size to get the entire tops of the teeth.  I move the toothbrush around to scrub everywhere well.  I think it's worth the money just to try them, and see if you like them.",

You have to push the top down to expel the product on the top, right by the little metal eye rollers. The under eye cream smells ok, somewhat medicinal, herbal, not bad but not the best either but I can handle it.<br /><br />You use those eye rollers to massage it into the skin which is neat and I personally like it since it does help firming the skin. I prefer to put it into the fridge prior to using it since the cooling helps even more, at least I found it does in my case. This cream absorbs quickly, I do use my fingers in the end to make sure everything is fully absorbed, but it does leave a slight greasy residue on the skin. This stays for some time so I would recommend using this in the evening because of that.<br /><br />All in all this is a very nice product.

Maybe if you have an actual barbers chair it works better. I was using a towel as a cape when I cut my husband and kids hair, and this on top of a towel for the lower back (or two of these capes alternating directions so the long part can go in the front and the back) should do a better job than just the towel. The fabric is cheap thin polyester, which gets the job done but is definitely not \"ultra soft silk fiber\" as stated in the description.

It is very easy to use, basically a sheet mask that you put over your face. I like the fact that it comes in two pieces so you really can make it fit perfectly to your face. The one pieces are just one fits all kind of masks and lets face it, not all faces are the same scie or shape and therefore they just don't all fit. With this one you have a lot of nice wriggle room which is great.<br /><br />It is very easy to put on. Once it is on you let it sit for about 15 to 20 minutes (btw, if you go longer you get more of the goodies). So just have a good show on tv or a book handy to read. I did notice that it is fairly heavy though but it amazingly did not slip on me but I was afraid that it may.<br /><br />This mask smells beautifully of roses and for once not overpowering of it. I am not the biggest fan of the smell of roses but this one was pleasant since it was not this cloying smell of it. This is a collagen mask and when you remove it you can tell how soft your face is. I really liked this mask but it is on the more expensive side. You get 4 masks in the box for $25, so each is about $6, so that is a bit on the higher end of sheet masks but they are very nice.",

Provides a well-defined, extremely moisturized and bouncy twist out.\ntext: This is an extremely moisturizing cream that my 4a/4b hair absolutely drinks up!! My hair is extremely dry after washing and letting it air dry (even though I always add a leave-in and oil). So, I decided to use this to help moisturize and twist my hair. I could just feel my hair going from super dry to extremely soft and moisturized from just one application of each section! I also applied this over castor oil, which I applied to my hair beforehand. (I use the L.O.C. moisturization method).<br /><br />I then twisted my hair and applied this generously (my twist outs always come out better when I'm more generous with my product of choice). After 10 hours or so, I took out my twists and had a very well-defined twist out! There was absolutely no frizz - even after separating each twist (I undo the twist and the split each section in half). I'm really happy with the results.<br /><br />The pics I'm included are of a two-day-old twist out  (I forgot to take a pic on the first day) and my hair still looks great - a little frizzy from sleeping on it, but nothing horrible. I just spritzed on a little leave-in conditioner to refresh my hair and it looked just as good as the first day. This cream is wonderful and allows me to easily go 4-5 days on one twist out - something that many other products just don't do for my hair.<br /><br />This has a really sweet, pleasant smell to it. It's a white cream that's on the thick side, but very easy to work with and absorbs nicely into the hair - doesn't just sit on top. I also love that it doesn't make my hair feel all crunchy or crispy. My twist out was really soft and my curls were bouncy. Thanks to providing great hold, amazing definition, and complete hydration for dry, frizzy hair, you can't get wrong using this product!<br /><br />I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review.

It does contain enough glycolic acid at a decent ph, it does exfoliate well.  Whatever praises people bestow are germane but only to a certain degree.  The fact of the matter though is that the entire line of products contain many unefficacious artificial ingredients at best and downright harmful toxins, in effect, at worst.<br /><br />It has plenty of potential but does not deliver.  It seems to me that the makers are not truly interested in answering the riddle to great skin.  It is a start devoid of middle or end notes.  It does not cater to the skin as a complete system.  It will give you a minor improvement and waste a lot of your time.<br /><br />But don't take my word for it, try it for yourself.  If you love it and are happy good for you.  I will not throw cigarette buds on anyones Eden.  If however you are not a believer like me and want to try another alternative try something with ONLY natural ingredients.  Anything else and your skin will be in a constant battle with adversaries you put there, everyday, and leave there to do damage, because it's absurd to think that the body could assimilate such artificiality in any positive long-term way.<br /><br />The choice is yours my friends.",

May be lightening tear stains too--will update review.\ntext: This is an interesting way to market a Konjac Sponge, i.e. for your pets. I have to say though, it's pretty brilliant. I've only worked on my white chihuahua-blend's tear stains once with the All About Health Network Charcoal konjac sponge, but it did seem like it lightened his tear stains a bit. They're pretty significant now since he doesn't like his face washed. What was most important to me is that he actually seemed to like me cleaning his face with the sponge. It's very soft once hydrated, and the shape meant I could be careful not to get too near to his eyes. I also have a white frenchie who absolutely HATES having her face washed, but needs to have the folds of her face cleaned regularly. I'm going to order a second one because this has made that process much easier as well. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I don't yet know if it can remove tear stains, but given how hard they are to get rid of I somehow doubt it. I'll update the review if it works well over time though!<br /><br />Please note I most likely purchased this at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. In order to save time, I do as much of my shopping online as is humanly possible. I rely heavily on other customers reviews when making purchasing decisions, so as such, I take the honest and unbiased bit very seriously.

I used for chronic hip bursitis, lower back pain and tight SI joint.<br />I noticed I was getting the beginnings of a fever blister.  I couldn‚Äôt believe it and thought my immune system was compromised. (I haven‚Äôt had one since 5 years old, now 50)<br />I iced it when feeling the onset, took 4,000 mg of Lysine, put DSMO rose on it( never read anything about it concerning this but figured why not, I have it, no side effects besides tasting garlic in your mouth briefly)  popped zicam (zinc) tablets every hour, and did a dab of Abreva. The next day the fever blister disappeared almost. Half the size. I told my sister who couldn‚Äôt believe it either as she gets them 2x a year.<br />I would say to use this product (the rose cream first) if you are unfamiliar with DSMO before you graduate to liquid. Now that I know it can be used for anything besides pain, I‚Äôm all in.<br />I will say for pain, when used with other things in combination/conjunction  (Joint care by Redd. Remedies), MSM course organic flakes and DSMO, you don‚Äôt have to reach for prescription meds. You can find all on amazon.  I have all prescription meds under the sun for my condition. Pain meds, muscle relaxers, lidocaine patches..But I am firm believer prescription meds lead to other problems or diseases. Try natural first.  My concoction of the 3 natural works wonders.

            "question": "title: Love this razer, just like I loved the previous model (same razer)\ntext: Summary: Nothing not to like!<br /><br />Background: Previously, I owned the earlier model of this razer. It was the same exact razer except it used to be blue. I loved this razer, but it was eaten by a dog! I didnt want to cough up the full cost of this direct replacement, so I used a lower-end Norelco. As you may know, the lower models do not feature the \"Speed-XL\" shaving heads (which have 3 concentric rings of blades (per head)). Instead it had the single outer row of blades, which is pretty typical of any non-high-end razer.<br /><br />Why this razer is good:<br />The point of my background story is that there is a SIGNIFICANT difference between the Speed-XL models, and older style heads. In fact THERE IS NO COMPARISON!  With the cheaper razer I had to go over my face at least twice as much, and usually more like 3x as much as with this razer. As with all electric's, you're not going to be able to make a single pass and get everything, but as electric's go, this razer (and all the Norelco's with Speed-XL) works great. Both myself and my dad (who is used to foil razers) agree that Speed-XL is the best electric we've used!<br /><br />Some niceties of this razer are that its VERY easy to clean. Usually you can just pop the top and tap most of the hair out, maybe use the brush real quick. I dont feel like I have to do a deep cleaning (taking the heads out and apart) very often because it doesnt seem to trap a lot of hair in the heads. But if you want to, its very easy to access everything.<br />The body is waterproof, so you can clean it out with water as a middle ground between just tapping hair out and dissassembly.<br />The charger is now VERY small, and takes up only a single plug (even on a strip), and the base is also small.<br />Battery life: lets me shave for multiple days (at least 4) before it needs charging.<br /><br />That said there are some minor quibbles. Like most Norelco razers, the charger doesnt shut off automatically, so you need to be careful with leaving it plugged in all the time. My solution: leave the charger in a draw, keep the stand on my countertop to hold the razer all the time, and then just get the charger out (and plug it into the stand) when the razer actually needs charged, which for me is only ever handful of days. this also has the added benefit of saving some small amount of energy by not having the wall wart plugged in while you're not charging.<br />This razer now comes with a form fitting travel case, and you cant put the razer in it with the hair gaurd on it :( so make sure you clean it before you travel with it. You also cant fit the charger in the case...its really a case JUST for the razer, to protect it in your regular toiletries bag.<br /><br />All in all any of the speed-xl razers will cut the same, so just buy the model that has the accessories you want. I think this model represents the best value because its the cheapest :) personally i dont care about a multi-step battery readout, or a cleaning station...but if you do buy those versions.",

In this case I didn't notice any ill after effects - the Tourmaline Ceramic plates are designed to be softly reactive to your hair, so this may be the reason. The best advice I can give is to be aware of the heat settings - I typically use the lowest and work my way up depending on how my hair reacts.<br /><br />Like most flat irons by Parwin, it heats up fast and has a swivel cord. Given how many flat irons there are on the market, I would say this is OK in terms of what it does for the price. I wouldn't say it was exceptional but I like the versatility of the dry hair option.",

Comes with a silvery tone putty type substance in a little container all you have to do is put your hands in kind of rub it around your hands and then run it through your hair. It was really the easy to do on someone else but takes a little bit more time to do on yourself though if you get some on your skin or ears or wherever you can just take a wet damp towel or a white or something like that and wipe it right off. In the picture that shows you doing it too long hair but I tried it on my long hair and absolutely did not work I could not pull a comb through it and it was hard and strange and it definitely works better on men's hair that is short. When it was dry it got kind of hard like a gel or something like that. It's really easy to make it look nice you just have to continue working it through the hair until you get the desired color and style that you want. We tried it on a beard as well and it didn't look as good on the beard it kind of looked better on the medium to short hair but not super super short like a beard. We even used it and my boyfriend's hair who is African-American and it came out pretty cool. Kind of makes you look like you have silver gray hair. It was really easy to wash out renting it out just with water gets a lot of it off but a little bit of shampoo get it out in just a second. I don't recommend going to bed with this in your hair as it will leave silver glimmery stuff on your pillowcase to make sure you wash before going to sleep or laying down on anything.",

            "question": "title: Thrilled with this mask!!\ntext: I love this product! It comes in a small container so I was kind of bummed at first, but what little product is in here packs a powerful punch.  I highly recommend this if you're looking for a clay or mud type of mask to clarify and clear your skin. I suffer from deep cystic acne and broke out earlier this week. I put on this mud mask and I could not believe how great the results were. Within one day my pimples had disappeared and even my damage spots seem to be less noticeable.  My skin felt super soft and clear.<br /><br /> I have a pretty sensitive skin but I didn't have any irritation from this whatsoever. The package says to leave the mask on for 10 or 15 to 20 minutes but I noticed that even after 20 minutes, the mask still was not dried so I did leave it on for longer.  It is a bit of a drying mask so if you already have dry skin, you will want to use a moisturizer following the mask.  I found that when I combined it with my acne medication that contains benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid, it was just to drying for my skin. Therefore, I would recommend maybe skipping a day of other chemical products when you use this mask.<br /><br /> The mask it goes on really nice and smooth. I used a Q-tip to mix up the mask material as the directions say to stir it each time you're going to use it.  Then I just used the Q-tip to apply the mask and I from layer on my face.  The mask has a cooling a fact and isn't a dry or itchy at all. It was a very pleasant experience overall. It wasn't messy at all to use either.<br /><br /> I posted some pictures below of the material in the jar as well as when it was on my face.  That way, you can see how quickly I put the mask on my face.  I hope the photos are helpful.<br /><br /> Again, I recognize that this is a smaller container than I had previously thought, but you don't need much to cover your entire face. Although I can't say for sure, I am guessing that I would get at least 10 to 15 masks with this product. That is quite a bit considering how much is charged for mud mask facials at spas.  Do you make sure that you see all the container tightly and store it in a cool or dark place as it will dry out quickly if you leave it open.",

This mask has a good amount of serum on it so you can easily leave it on for 20 minutes without having to worry that it will dry out, you could probably go longer yet. My face was a bit sticky afterwards but that feeling did go away after about  minutes or so. The serum in the mask had a pleasant smell that I did like a lot.

Conveniently, it didn‚Äôt slip at all, even while sitting up and looking at my cell phone.  I could smell the green tea, but it wasn‚Äôt overwhelming.  TIP:  I‚Äôve learned that Karuna masks leave A LOT of serum on the face that doesn‚Äôt easily absorb into the skin once the mask is removed.  I left the mask on for 30 minutes, increasing absorption and letting it dry out a bit...I highly recommend this, followed by splashing cool water on your face to gently remove any excess serum.  This prevents sticky skin and left my face feeling smooth and soft almost immediately.  Within 2 hours my skin felt hydrated and looked brighter and super clean.  Very happy with this mask!",

The one I have in the picture below has been on for four days now and it still looks just like the day I applied at.<br /><br /> I love all of the different packs of variety so that you can get a pack of that suits your style and needs.  I would definitely recommend these. Application is really simple.  You pick the tattoo you want and place it in side down on your skin wherever you would like it to be. Just make sure it is straight and where you want it before you apply the wet paper towel.  You just take a wet paper towel and place it over the paper side of the tattoo. The other side you adhere to your skin. Then hold it there for 30 seconds, and when you left it off, the tattoo stays on your skin and the paper peels away. Then, just let it dry.<br /><br /> Love these! I highly recommend them. Happy shopping",

I was a bit disappointed by the entire line to be honest. It is a bit on the more expensive side with all their products being at least $34 and up. Some of them are on the even more expensive side in my eyes for what you get. They do tend to fall short on the fragrance side across the board.<br /><br />This line is just not for me and did not perform well for me overall.

            "question": "title: The good, the bad and the ugly...\ntext: My review consists of the good, the bad and the ugly. First,<br />the good - I finally found a curler that 'fits' my eyelid. Huh, you say? Well, it appears that most of the manufacturers believe I have golf balls instead of human eyes. The tool's shape is long and shallow enough of a curve to catch most of the eyelashes. It is comfortable to use, but takes a bit of practice. Once you are comfortable with the scissor motion (sorry, no other way to describe it) used to make the curl, you are rewarded with a nice, non-crimpy curl. The pad in this one is the best I have used. This tool also opens wide enough that even the most nearsighted or lush lashed amoungst us can get it close to the base of the upper lashes. The design over all is very well thought out. I recommend using an magnifying mirror if you have to use bifocals (I do). All that said, now...<br />the bad - there is no replacement pad and I am questioning how sanitary this is going to be in the long run. I agree completely with folks here who advise to REMOVE ALL EYE MAKEUP before use. Ain't nothing pretty about an eye infection. I am wondering out loud how to properly clean this curler to be certain it remains safe. If you are prone to sties and other types of infection, I would be asking the same questions. Which leads to...<br />the ugly - until you practice and are used to it (won't take long) the results are a bit odd looking. The black pad is plushier and looks to be made of silicone and not the usual hard rubber. I have found that the hard rubber pads are chiefly responsible for that weird ugly crimp you can get. Not so with this one. I mentioned before the squeezy scissor action your thumb and index finger have to use can be tricky. If you have coordination issues, well - things could get ugly.<br />SUGGESTIONS for use...wash your hands before use. I keep the little plastic clip to keep the tool closed. You could follow the advise of one person here to heat the tool with a dryer, but I think I may skip that. Use a makeup mirror to assist you. Practice when you have some time.

I specifically wanted one large enough to use full-sized shampoo bottles. This one won't take huge bottles, but it will take them about 9 inches tall and not too wide. It also fits my deodorant, a small bottle of body wash, and face wash in the main compartment. There's a small zippered compartment for my razor, and the side compartments hold combs, and toothbrush with toothpaste. Basically, everything I need in the gym shower is right there, hanging securely on a metal hook. The fabric is water resistant, so it can get splashed with shower spray without mildewing, and once my body wash leaked and the bag prevented the leak from going all over my gym bag. Overall, this was a very good purchase!",

We work in a medical office and had to double up our masks to be able to wear the bottom scarf and most of us were sweaty bc of this but the jems didn't budge!! A full 10hr work day and then some! I got home and these jems still stayed on for an additional like 4 hours and showed no signs of wanting to come off. Honestly would 100% recommend! They also weren't like single jems that take 100 hours to put on, these came on a strip and you could trim and adjust as needed. As you can see on mine I even created my own look by making the \"teeth\" go up and around my eyebrows while the part that shows to go around the eyes was placed under my eyes instead.",

It's also a two piece mask which is great in some ways because sometimes I looks like a one person comedy routine trying to get the masks on right while they flip and flop all over.<br />With this mask you put the bottom part then the top by your eyes, it makes it a lot easier. Then you leave it on for at least 20 minutes ( though it says to leave it on for 30 so I did that). When you take it off you gently pat the left over into your skin.<br />It leaves your skin feeling so soft and really well moisturized. I feel like it did a very nice job with firming up the skin as well. I have only used two of these so far, one a week over two weeks, and have really liked the way my skin looked and felt after each use. I would recommend giving these a try if you can. Perhaps in summer as they have a nice cooling feel to them that I bet would feel great in the summer heat!",

I still have no problems with it. it took a trim or two to get used to the new settings from my old trimmer but what dont you have to get used to when you change brands. I read a few articles from other users saying they had hair all over the place when they used it. they either look like grizzly adams and try to mow the whole thing at once or? I cut from the bottom of my face going up and never had more than a few hairs that didnt get in the vaccuum. It might depend on your style of cutting,havnt tried from the top down to see if the vaccuum gets it all. thats not my style of trimming. In my book its perfect..do you know why things are not always perfect because everybody has their own opinion. I hope this helps you in any way..Lyndon",

I used the mask after taking a hot bath and washing with my regular cleanser to help open the pores, soften any blackheads, and loosen the dead skin. It works well, drying in about 20 minutes. It left my skin feeling soft. I then finished with the serum and enjoyed the selfcare it promotes. A nice addition to my routine.",

            "question": "title: Smaller Pores !!!!\ntext: Let me start off by saying I have combination skin and have not had great luck with many mud masks, but, Dead Sea mud seems to be what works for me. Ok I've had luck with a couple mud masks on here and one of those I really liked but,... I can only use the one I really loved every couple of months because it has peel like ingredients and that's not the type of mask to use weekly or bi weekly . This type of mask could be used at least weekly without harsh affects. I was definitely skeptical about the smaller pores claim but it's true !!!! I had my daughter do a video on her iPod and even though it wasn't really noticeable in the mirror afterwards to me at least, on the video the larger pores I have were actually smaller. I cannot figure out how to upload a video from anything other then my iPad so later this week I'm going to get a video or pictures on my iPad so I can post the difference. It's crazy how a mud can do this much without me noticing any major intenseness that I get from my other favorite mud mask, so pretty much I'm getting results without the burning, oh and this is also WAY more then what I get in the jar of my other stuff. So a. It's more, b. It's more affordable, c. It's easier on my skin and yeah you get the picture,. This is definitely the best mud mask you can get for the money and it really shrinks your pores, or my pores at least. My combination skin feels good and &#34;normal&#34; for two to three days after. Now that might not be a lot to you, but for me it's a miracle because usually by day two I'm oily on my problem areas and that's not fun. I highly recommend this mask to anyone looking for an affordable mask that'll last a long time, meaning it's not a ridiculously small jar.I was lucky enough to get a discounted price to try this item out and let people know how it worked out for me. In no way am I obligated to rate one way or another. I rate in relevance to how the product does or does not suit me and my needs. My opinions are just that and what I feel may not be the same as someone else's views. If I am not happy with the product that will be definitely noted in my review , and I hope it helps buyers make an informed decision before spending their hard earned money . I know that when buying online ,reviews are the only thing that us as customers can rely on and I really hope that I can help .Reading reviews is what helps me make decisions when I am purchasing something online .Thank you so very much for taking the time to read my review and please feel free to ask me any questions you might have . I hope that this review has helped inform you of this product and helped you make a decision whether this product would be what you are looking for.

It says it fits up to 24\" head, and mine measures 23.5\". Then I have loads of hair- semi thick, nearly waist length. It all fits! Yet isn't a big bulbous excess of material either. But I am definitely pushing max space available (again, I have a large head).<br /><br />I simply dont wash my hair every day, but I do hop in the shower. I dont notice my hair getting wet at all, but I dont put my head in the water even with this on. I have a spray nozzle for washing and rinsing, so I guess I am able to control where the water reaches better.<br /><br />The fit is surprisingly good. The rear has an elastic portion to provide a nice fit. The spacing left over once in place is reasonable for my large head and mane of hair. I really was skeptical, but am glad I went ahead and got this. I have some cute shower caps, but none as nice as this. The little bow on top makes me feel like I went back in time to the 50s or something. Adorbs!<br /><br />I dont use it for keeping my hair out of face for make up or skin care, but it would certainly do well for that too. Also, if I had pool.. while it isnt a pool cap, if I just wanted something to help keep excess water off my hair while casually wading in a pool, this very well could work for that too.",

But I was in the search for a more affordable toner/emulsion/serum and was excited when they introduced this line and gave a discount. They really sold this beta-hyaluronic whatever that works 1.5x better and I thought it was a new patented technology. But no. Contrary to their marketing claim, there is no such thing as beta hyaluronic acid.  Yes I looked up patent registry and trademark registry and Amorepacific didn‚Äôt register anything new in the past few years related to hyaluronic acid. They just put a new spin on beta glucan, which according to some studies works 20% better, not 150% like they claim. Also beta glucan is toward the end of the ingredient list, meaning we have no idea how much of it is even in there. It‚Äôs so disappointing that Amorepacific decides to just flat out lie to customers about it. Makes me go wonder what else they are lying about.<br /><br />Now I would not have done all the research if the serum worked well in the first place. But it came with no safety seal which made me go um. The packaging felt cheap. The liquid felt cheap and diluted. My skin smelled like plastic. My skin didn‚Äôt stay hydrated like other serums and that‚Äôs when I knew something was up. I bought toner, emulsion and serum. The emulsion was sealed but the toner and serum was not. I didn‚Äôt even bother trying the emulsion. I‚Äôll be returning these all. I will also be seeking new skincare products that are not made by Amorepacific. Goodbye.",

I love the unique container as the brush comes out of the tube the same way lipstick does. However, the container is thin and the bristles are only marginally soft and definitely feel synthetic and are shiny. However, there is no shedding. A brush like this is good for travel where it will be used sparingly.<br /><br />The star of this set are the three blender sponges. There are two sponges with a flat side which is great for smooth applications. The other sponge is a typical egg-shaped sponge that is good for blending or any large make-up application. These blenders feel good in the hands, blend well, and feel soft against my skin. They do have a slight smell to them but it is not offensive.<br /><br />The current price of $10.99 for 4 pieces comes to a pricey $2.75 per item. I love the sponges and to me they are five stars; however the brush is 2 stars to me. This brush only makes sense for travel or someone who wants a brush that remains covered and will not soil their other make-up applicators or bag.

I have stubborn, hard to hold curls kinda hair, but I curled my hair before bedtime and woke up still with nice curls! I went to work at the hospital and needless to say, it lasted my entire 8 hour shift without hair products/hair spray! Everyone loved it as they never see me with curly hair unless I‚Äôm going out LoL The on my thing I don‚Äôt care for is the stand for placing it down, as I had to keep flipping it up and down when I was curling my hair. One thing I can recommend is to section your hair and when curling, only curl a small section at a time because if you grab too much hair (I have a lot of hair and thick hair too), then it won‚Äôt curl well. Another thing is, I can‚Äôt guess how long to hold my hair on the wand before releasing so I‚Äôm just guesstimating and pray I‚Äôve held it long enough to get the curl I want. I‚Äôm too afraid of holding too long, damaging my hair. I purchased this item bc it was on sale for less than $19, saving me $20, so I figured I‚Äôd give it a try. I also purchased a TYMO airflow flat iron/curler (on sale too) at the same time as this purchase and tested both products and since I love both, I‚Äôm keeping both! I‚Äôd recommend either products or both! Woman can never have enough hair styling products, makeup or skin care products LoL",

            "question": "title: like a black body suit is being painted onto each lash; zero eye irritation, easy to wash off\ntext: I may be in the minority here, but I rather like this mascara. And yes, it is made in China. Not, \"made for USA but made in China\", but it is a Chinese beauty product. No idea if its been around, how it ranks with beauties on that side of the world. Couldn't tell you the ingredients. Tried translating, but I repeatedly failed. Search engines insisted that I was looking for CPAP not CPCP.<br /><br />So, I usually end up with more mascara that I DONT like rather than what I DO like. I LIKE THIS.<br /><br />Why?  Because my eyes are super sensitive to make up, and this doesn't bother me. AT ALL. I love mascara, but often find myself needing to wash it off after a couple of hours (if not immediately, depending on the brand). No joke. It sucks.  So when I encounter a mascara that..well.. allows me to actually wear it- I add to my list of potential repurchase. I have tried so many over the years. Funny thing, a few on my list happen to be cheap mascara (Essie, Wet-n' Wild,), --but not all-- and most mid level priced brands bother me as well as uber expensive \"natural, healthy\" brands. What I have noticed is that the WATERPROOF brands do the best in terms of feeling gentle and non irritating (probably less likely to flake). Next up, is the most recent generation of mascara that includes \"4D silk fiber lashes\", which this is.<br /><br />The 4D Silk Fiber Mascara is so very different in feel and performance over traditional mascara. It has this interesting ability to coat the lashes- like a black body suit is being painted onto each lash. It easily and instantly really darkens the lashes, and can add volume and length. The formulas tend to be waterproof, and yet somehow wash off much much much easier than typical waterproof formulas. So for me, from application through face washing, the 4 D silk mascara is much easier and gentler to work with.<br /><br />My lashes do not look like how they have it portrayed in the pics. If you already have long lashes, I imagine this will be extra glamorous on you. For me, with my mediocre lashes that simply need a boost of color to make me happy (and not make me want to claw my eyes out)- this works well on me. I included several pics. 3 with one eye with it on, one eye with it off. Then I followed up with 3 pics of the mascara on both.<br /><br />It shouldn't matter, but the box is super pretty. I still have it, and I have no use for it, but it is just so pretty to look at. Added a picture of the mascara wand.<br /><br />If I can glean any further information about this product, I will come back and add to this review.",

I also like how this product is empowering women in Turkey... A very neat story; go to the Anitoche website to read about it.  This soap deserves more than a 5 star review.

This set of 6 bottles are great for holding just enough to last the trip.  There are three 100 cc (the maximum amount per bottle for carry-on) spray bottles.  Also, there are three 60 cc pump bottles.  Each is made of hard plastic and 5.5 inches tall.  They fit very well into a purse or cosmetic bag.<br /><br />I put shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and hand sanitizer in them.  They are clear, so TSA shouldn‚Äôt have a problem with it when screening at the airport.  The pump and spray are easy to operate.  One word of caution on the pumps:  The pump attachment does not lock, so I recommend saving the little clip that came with the bottle to keep the pump in a locked position.  In summary, these are good quality pumps and spray bottles for a great price.",

She uses it daily for mainly combing and straightening her hair. Gets hot quick, less than 30 secs. Used on long around 12-18 inch black, thick, full set of hair. Used after showering with damp hair mostly and works fine. Uses it as a brush/comb. Steam is used when her hair is dry. We had a hard time finding distilled water with all the shortages. So this review took us a month to complete. Normal everyday use is great on her thick rebellious hair. We don't use the steam as often but works great when hair is dry and needs moisture to brush. Great accessory or upgrade to your regular combing/brushing. Some parts are hard to get too, without a mirror or hard reach areas, like behind your head. Hope this helps. If you buy a gallon of distilled water its plenty for occasional use.",

The pink stays on really well even though I have to wear steel toed shoes at work every day.  Other (high end) brands have failed that test often. The pink color stays solid with that test long enough that my nails start growing out and I have to change out the polish for that reason.  The purple color must have a higher pigment load because it did chip slightly where my toe rubs against the box of my steel toed shoes. But that is still way better than other polishes. It even survives my regular beach trips.<br /><br />The polish has helped with the damage to my toe nails. The cracking I was getting is less. My family has an inherited condition that over the years causes the toe nails to thicken. The older generation has thicken so much that they have to use a rotary tool to trim their nails.  I gave a bottle of the clear to one of the men with the issue and he has seen an improvement as well. I can only hope that with the continued use my nails will never reach the level that theirs have. Since I saw a huge improvement when I started using it, I think there is a good chance.<br /><br />P.S. I am a nail polish junkie. If it is available in the US, I've tried it.",

Because I follow up using toner and moisturizer, this isn't a huge deal for me and doesn't prevent me from continuing to use Tinazana cleanser.  There is a light, faint, fresh scent that I enjoy.

It also doesn't last; when I rinse the cleanser off, I can no longer detect the scent at all.<br /><br />Due to skin sensitivity issues, I sometimes have issues with citrus based products.

They essentially sold me a brand new Philips HQ7120 as a replacement to use with my existing shaving unit for a reasonable price; it looks exactly the same except it has a \"Low\" red light.<br /><br />The interesting bit is that I had gone to them about a month ago to buy a new shaving unit and they told me the HQ9 heads would work fine with these models, not just the HQ8; the HQ9 feel even better, so much so that I would definitely buy the 8xxx series which use the HQ9... It was only when the 7140 failed that I realized just how much I depend on it and how well it has worked out - my technique still needs to improve and shaving still seems to take too long but no going back to blades for me!<br /><br />-----------------<br /><br />As a wet shaving refugee I didn't know what to expect; I was just tired of getting cuts everyday, and paying an exhuberant tax to the wet shaver companies; I didn't want to buy a top of the line model in case things didn't work out.<br /><br />This has been a very pleasant surprise, as I'm getting close shaves with less fuss and no irritation; I beginning to get the hang of this and even the neck area is doing well.<br /><br />The battery's first run lasted for 4 days, but I may be taking a lot longer than normal while I learn. The battery light starts blinking when it's fuly charged, by the way.<br /><br />I have the Philips branded verion of this and it still says Made in Holland...",

This hit the mark perfectly! He has dark brown hair and I was a bit skeptical on how well it would show up, but it was wonderful. It was easy to apply, but you definitely want to make sure the hair is wet. You want to wear gloves, but honestly it washes off the hands with soap and water. It last all day and a simple shampoo will take it right out. The only thing I will warn, is it does transfer surfaces fairly easily. It will rub off on hands, towels, chairs, beds, and clothes, so be aware of where you put your hair/head. That being said, it washes off all of those things very easily.",

I decided to try this product because I wanted a change from all the red highlights and thought it would be nice to tone down to a browner hue.  I not only followed the instructions to the letter, but had several exchanges with the seller to make sure what I was doing was correct.  The good news is that this combination beautifully toned down the red from all my prior years of using henna only.  The bad news is that NOT ONE gray hair (I'm dark brown with about 15% gray) gave up being gray! So in addition to the hassle, mess and expense of doing this treatment (and make no mistake - it's messy and time consuming) I will have to double up this month and do my regular henna only routine.  I did a bit of research, by the way, and learned that most henna/indigo distributors, unlike Harvest Moon, suggest mixing up the henna and indigo powders SEPARATELY and then combining.  Based on my experience, I'd have to say this would probably work better (the rationale probably being the same as why combining shampoo and conditioner together don't work as well as shampooing and THEN conditioning).  Likewise, everyone else except Harvest Moon recommends wrapping the hair in plastic wrap and then covering with a shower cap and leaving on for a MINIMUM of 2 hours (Harvest Moon says their product works in less than one hour and is against wrapping.)  Leaves me to wonder if the gray hairs would not be gray had I followed the advice of the other henna/indigo distributors.  Here's a good reference website:  [...]",

I don't paint my nails much, but I finally gave this a try about 10 days ago. It went on beautifully, with full coverage in one coat. It dried super fast & was hard as nails when dry (about 10-15 minutes). Once it was completely dry, it had absolutely no odor. Zero. This is something that's important to me because I'm sensitive to fragrances. As the days went by, it held up extremely well. It didn't chip at all, but just wore off naturally on the very tips of my nails. Looked like a natural grow-out, instead of chipping. Ten days later, it was finally time for a re-do. I was very impressed with this product, all around (at least the peach, which is the only one I've tried so far). I'll come back and update, if my experience with the other colors isn't the same.",

This box of Anti-Aging sheet masks comes with 5 masks. Each mask is individually wrapped. When you open up a mask and remove it from the packing, you see that there are 2 layers. One is the sheet mask which is thin and papery like. The other is a plastic type material. The two layers are together, so I put both of them on my face. The other masks that I have used didn't have this plastic layer. I couldn't get it to lay flat on my skin very well, so I peeled the plastic layer off leaving just the paper one. This was what I was more familiar with. That layer was easy to mold to my face. The mask was very cold which felt refreshing. It's very wet - not to the point of dripping off my face, but enough that you want to spread it around more on the mask as it is on your face. It says to leave it on for 15-20 minutes. I opted for the lesser time because my coffee was ready & I didn't want to wait any longer for it! Then you are supposed to rub any left over &#34;goo&#34; (for a lack of a better word) into you skin. I accidently got a little into my eye, but it didn't burn or sting at all, which surprised me. I have very sensitive eyes and was expecting to feel some pain. I regularly use anti-aging products, plus I have only used one of these sheet masks so far, so I don't notice any difference to my skin, but I would definitely add this to my beauty routine.<br /><br />*I purchased these masks at a reduced price for the purpose of trying out & reviewing.

            "question": "title: Great Resin Decorating Sampler and Tools\ntext: I am happy with my order of the Resin Decorative Accessories Set. This was packaged well and arrived in great condition. What I really like is that this set of tools and inclusions comes in a multi-level box that is transparent. It is easy to see what inclusions are inside, which is very easy to use while working on a project. Pipettes are really great to remove bubbles and also to apply very small amounts of resin into detailed areas. The silicone mat is essential to protect a working surface and the tweezers are very useful to add small items into a poured resin piece. There are also extra 30ml mixing cups, tiny spoons and wooden sticks.<br /><br />These inclusions are great to use with other materials besides resin like nail art, decoupage glues, acrylic paint and polymer clay. This makes the set versatile for working with different mediums and for different projects. There are full round hole-less beads and also half beads. I really like the tiny seashells, my set also includes a tiny starfish. I am putting these into a resin painting with some sand I saved from a recent beach vacation. The only thing included with this set that is not useful to me are the finger cots, as I prefer to wear gloves when working with resin. The only negative aspect is very small, but some glitter was loose. I did not find this to be bothersome, but did want to mention that. There is a lot of supplies in this kit and I consider it to be a really great value for all that is included. I hope that my experience is helpful as you kindly click the button below.",

            "question": "title: Relatively strong water flosser but reservoir is attached which makes drying it nearly impossible\ntext: I have used various countertop water flossers in the past such as the countertop WaterPik and the [[ASIN:B07HRNGS3Q Truwell Handheld Water Flosser]].  I love the idea of a hand held irrigator and this does work to remove most stuck debris from between the teeth. What is nice about this one over the other handheld I tried, is that there is very little splash back. However, I personally do not like that the reservoir is not removable for drying.<br /><br />IN THE PACKAGE<br />- One reservoir attached to handheld flosser unit<br />- One USB cable (wall adapter NOT included)<br />- One instruction manual<br />- One standard jet nozzle<br />- One orthodontic nozzle (larger brush)<br />- One pocket nozzle (smaller brush)<br />- One tong scraping nozzle (what looks like a spoon)<br /><br />I charged the unit fully before use. The white light on the side blinks when charging and remains steady when it is fully charged. Note the charging port is hidden behind a silicone nub below the grip dots on the top of the unit. Be careful to cover the charging port with this nub when the flosser is in use.<br /><br />There is an on/off switch and a mode switch. The three water pressure modes are soft, standard, and massage can be cycled through using the mode switch prior to turning the unit on. The jet tip (or any of the other three tips) gets inserted into the top. Be careful to make sure it is seated with the notch in the groove as the first time I put it in the hole, I did not have it seated all the way. To eject, press the release button to the left side.<br /><br />The reservoir IS NOT removable. Instead water enters through the small opening on bottom through which one has to fill the unit. I do not like that the reservoir is attached as I have to drain the remaining water out of that hole and leave the door open for drying. Also, the little button through which the water enters can easily break after lots of use. I personally would prefer not to have to use that hole.<br /><br />I held my mouth almost totally closed during use and tried all three modes. I did not have splash back, which was very nice. Splash back is usually typical of almost any type of water flosser so to some extent I was surprised. This flosser does work to dislodge most debris between teeth but not everything because it is not super powerful but is powerful enough. I am also impressed that the manual is relatively well written; kudos to the manufacturer on this. Normally, I feel as if I am reading Pig Latin when I receive products from China or other countries.<br /><br />In summary, my biggest disappointment with this unit is the attached reservoir that prevents me from drying this out easily.",

I can not smell any fragrance with this at all,<br />this is best used in light applications for body and hair- a little goes along way! Its NOT gloppy like olive oil/almond/canola, seems lighter than grape seed oil even.<br />Worth the $. I lightly apply it through my hair the day I need to wash it- lightly oil all hair, twist up/clip, time it like a light hot oil treatment so it can soak in and work. It is a God send for unruley eyebrows. It washes right out no residue. I do this 2 times a week. I live in the desert/New Mexico/hard water/50 yrs/unprocessed thick semi curly hair. My hair shines but its not oily looking after washing, it semi tames and makes it so much better...it looks alive and healthy. My beautican is astounded. I have found its so much cheaper and works far much better than high scale salon items. It feeds your hair and body.<br />How I apply this I squeaze a small amount (pea size) onto one palm then rub my hands/palms quickly together till oil is warm- then lay my hands on area and massage in-it sinks right into dry scaley elbows, chapped lips, wind burned knees- etc. it does leave a light very fine oil film if it doesnt soak in 100%. If that happens it doesnt stain my clothes.<br />Oddly I have found for some reason it heals skin/cuts/wind burn more quickly than salves.<br />I keep my oil bottle on the (metal) end of an old frozen OJ tube style container- making a tiny saucer in case a drop oil seeps out.<br />Just my 2 cents....",

            "question": "title: Cool once you get the hang of it....but the price...\ntext: I'm someone with extremely thick and stick straight hair.  My hair loses curl within an hour of me fixing it.  I've tried other rotating curling irons and haven't had much success with them, so I didn't have very high expectations for this beach waver.  I have been pleasantly surprised.  Once I got the hang of it, I found it to be pretty easy to use.  It features buttons that allow you to chooses which direction you would like to curl each section of hair, and a Home button that after each use, and after the previous section of hair is no longer attached, allows the barrel to return to a neutral starting point.  I ran into an issue the first few times I used it, which was accidentally hitting the home button while my hair was still around the barrel.  This caused the hair to get very tight and the barrel to press up against the scalp.  This is very easy to do and I definitely think a design change should take place to correct this issue.  The barrel is long enough for my medium-long hair and I can see it needing to be used more than once up and down the length of long hair.  The curling iron gets up to 410 degrees max, which works pretty well on my thick hair.  I've tried fixing my hair in different ways after using it, to see which method holds the curls longer.  I still have an issue with my hair losing the curls a bit to quickly but it's remedied by using styling products before and after curling it.  To be honest, I think this beach waver is very overpriced.  Maybe the results would be better for someone with thinner hair but I don't think I'd pay more than $50 for this curling iron.  Nice results, but the design flaws make this a product I won't reach for that often.",

And I do feel my teeth more slippery after using it.<br /><br />The included batteries lasted for 3 weeks and the unit won't operate as powerful as with a new fresh set of batteries, this thing is really powerful. So , don't judge the unit's power with the batteries supplied.<br /><br />The handle is one of the reason I took one star off, it becomes very slippery and when you need to turn around the toothbrush you need to use both hand, so it does not fall from my hand, unless you are not like me, that I realized that I use my other hand to lean on the sink, probably won't find it awkward, but otherwise is not big deal.<br /><br />If it fail, I will update this review and let you know how not surprised I was.",

The 3rd for the highest is very, very hot which my hand can't handle the heat if it gets in the airflow while blow drying. My hair is fine, curly, and pass my shoulders. It takes me much less than 10 minutes to completely dry it. Since my hair is curly, it is NOT 'boofed' out like bozo the clown. It is lying down on my head with a shiny looked to after I am down.

The colors are nice and blend in well, but the two peach/neutral ones are much lighter than I expected (although I find that to be the case with most elf cosmetics so I should have expected that!). The tubes are TINY but a little dab goes a long way, so they seem to be a fair price. These whips add a nice glow to my cheeks that is great for date night with my hubby or going to a party or other event, but I would not use them on a day-to-day basis.<br /><br />My only real complaint is that the product separates in the container, so you have to shake it up REALLY well before you squeeze a little out onto your fingertip or makeup sponge. If you don't shake it (and even when you do half the time), you end up with a gush of shimmery liquid dripping over your finger before any of the actual color squirts out. Most of the &#34;shimmer&#34; in these shimmering facial whips has ended up in my sink rather than on my face. If the product didn't separate like that and didn't need to be shaken like the dickens before use, then this would be a five star product in my book. As it is, these are lucky to get a three.",

It is clear.<br />-Very light scent<br />-Gentle feeling, non irritating on my dry, semi sensitive skin<br />-A little goes a long way, just use a little.. gently dab it on. Allow a minute to absorb before adding other products<br /> -Key ingredients, benefits:<br />Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) helps to repair skin, and Hyaluronic acid (HA) helps to attract and retain moisture.<br /><br />I am currently using a variety of Easydew products, some of which contain EGF. I love how my skin feels and looks. I have only recently added this in, and I don't expect a quick change. I am using it around lips, and am considering using it around eye area. Since this can be used near eyes, I may keep it only for that area. I have their serum and moisturizer with EGF & HA.  I would say from my experience with this line, is that this is more of a longer term use item. I see it says something about instant depuffing, but unless you have a real trouble spot, it may not be instantly noticeable. What I encourage is consistent use. Maybe add in their other fill up products or Repair Control EX, then use this for specific spots.<br /><br />My skin: mid 40s, clear, semi dry, semi sensitive, Rosacea (redness/visible veins).",

I have to take one star off immediately because the the bowl that came with this set was warped and unusable.  Cape is about 4 ft long in the front  about 1 ft in the back which is typical.  It's a silky material and I don't think it is 100% water proof.  I used it twice. After I colored my hair and rinsed it, my top was wet and covered with dye stains.  2nd time it was just wet.  The comb/tint brush works as expected. There was no dye on my ears so the ear covers worked. They have a point on the back , which is  a little irritating to the ear.",

This organic body polish is nicely scented with coffee and peppermint. Typically I make my own from organic ingredients, so I am picky and compare. I was very happy with the Alexa coffee body scrub. The package is a nice size at 8 oz. It also would make a wonderful gift if you are needing a quality pampering for someone.<br /><br />You can just get your feet wet if you are doing a pedicure with it. All you have to do is get your body wet, or the particular area you are using it on. I put a smidgen between my fingers and only use it on key body dry areas. If you want to slather it all over that is ok too! I just like to make it last because it is nice on my skin. I have several dry eczema areas and dry areas on my feet.<br /><br />I have used other brands and had to transfer it into another container of my own, I love that with this one I didn't have to! It is not to cumbersome in the shower, the package is easy to open and close. The Alexa brand is made in the USA with organic all natural moisturizers. My skin is soft silky smooth with the combination of the great ingredients of dead sea salt, organic oils, organic coffee and organic shea butter. I used the scrub on my hands, feet, upper arms and legs. The scrub doesn't leave behind an oily residue, just a nice soft skin feeling. It's great for light exfoliating. Scrub, rub and rinse!

Had a hard time getting them to apply in a decent fashion. This one definitely lost over the other pallet. The plus side is, it does come with some sticker stencils, and a pack of wipes and paint brushes. For it being so cheap, that does help make up a little bit for the quality.

I've waxed plenty in my lifetime, but always at a salon by a professional. Now I'm sitting here typing this review with an incredibly thin layer of wax all way down my still very hairy left leg.<br /><br />I purchased the wax roughly 3 months ago, so I don't think the wax is expired, and it was stored in the original packaging in the meantime. I think the main issue is with the roller unit in general. I was literally pulling more hairs out just rolling the wax onto my leg than I was will the couple of strips I did manage to try. I don't have an issue with pulling hairs or anything. Tweezing nose hairs, or threading is WAY more painful and I don't have an issue with either of those.<br /><br />It took the unit forever to just warm up enough, instructions are laughable at best (broken unclear English), the included wax cleanup wipes are useless & dry (I'm about to google how to remove all this excess wax off my leg in a moment here). I feel if I could break open the unit and heat the wax over the stove it would work 100% better, but I don't want to risk my cookware.<br /><br />Update: #1: I was able to successfully microwave the cartridge for 3 mins in a bowl of water. 5 minutes would likely work better for you as my cartridge was still warm when I started. The wax rolled much nicer this time around, but still required some pulling, however it started to pool on one side of the roller resulting in the whole roller stopping again and even got a spot onto my bathroom rug that I had been carefully avoiding... The irritation from the wax is worse than using a depilatory cream (such as Nair)<br /><br />Update #2: After oven an hour of attempting to remove the wax with various products. (baby oil, oil-free makeup remover, acetone, rubbing alcohol, body wash, and finally olive oil in that order). The olive oil and now trashed white washcloth finally did the trick. I really can't recommend avoiding this product enough. I'd be willing to try hard wax, but I'm not about to attempt anything from home until I consult with my local salon at my next nail / hair apt.",

Immediately, I loved how upscale the packaging was as was the unit itself. It also comes with a two year manufacturers warranty, which is amazing.  Certainly, it would make a very thoughtful and elegant gift. The unit heats up any saturated paper mask. You can purchase them on Amazon or very inexpensively buy the unsaturated masks and whip up your own ingredients. I loved how quickly the mask heats up, yet the unit does not get dangerously hot. Not only does a warm mask open your pores and absorb better but it feels amazing! It really made me feel pampered and relaxed, which most of us don't do often enough. I would highly recommend this mask heater. I want to thank the manufacturer, Kindom Cares, for providing me this electric mask heater at a discounted price in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.

            "question": "title: Beautiful rainbow set of glass nail files!\ntext: I've been wanting to try the glass nail files now for several years.  The cost of them was always a deterrent until I found this great 5 piece value set.<br /><br />I was so excited to get them and try them out. I was so tired of buying  nail files over and over again only to have them break or bend in my purse or just wear out after a month or two. I wanted to invest in something that would last a little bit longer even if it was more than the usual dollar store Emery boards I've become so frustrated with. It seems the cheap files I had been buying were constantly had to replace them.<br /><br />The nail files were shipped to me promptly and they are not only extremely functional, but beautiful. I ordered the rainbow set of 5 and they're soooo pretty.  My favorite is the emerald green one, which is so much more vibrant than it appears in the stock photo and In my crappy phone photo.  I love them. The set comes with a hard case to store them in. And the 5  files in their cases come in a larger zipped pouch!  they are the perfect size to throw in a purse, keep in my desk at work, stow in the console of my car, and store in my makeup bag while still having one extra in my medicine cabinet at home.  When you consider how much I spend on files for my nails and feet on a monthly basis, and I should never have to replace these --- they come with a lifetime guarantee. That is just crazy to me. I will be buying these for gifts for sure. I can‚Äôt wait to tell everyone about them.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest opinion/review. If I had paid full price for it, I would still say the same thing. I rely heavily on reviews before I make a purchase so I realize how important they are. Hopefully, you have found this review helpful. Thanks and happy shopping!",

My eyebrows are also tattooed which I cannot recommend highly enough.<br /><br />They say no eyelashes but I do mine very carefully with the mascara wand, again leaving on for about 2 hours. Between the dyed brows and lashes I don't usually wear makeup.<br /><br />When you mix the tint with the developer, put the developer in the mixing cup first!

It makes my face look awful during a video call or even at a photo shoot. So I am always on the lookout for something that may help.<br /><br />This Cell Fusion C moisturizing gel is promising. The product came in a tube enclosed in a small box. The box around it is sprinkled with instructions. English instruction at the right side and equivalent Korean at the back. There are no leaflets inside regarding the product. I guess the manufacturer believes the pieces of information provided around the box are more than enough.<br /><br />To use, I uncapped the translucent plastic hinged cap. There is a foil safety seal at the tube‚Äôs mouth I need to remove. I love the smell of this. It is flowery with a hint of Philippine Jasmine (Sampaguita) and Perfume Tree (Ilang-Ilang). There is also a teeny-tiny hint of lavender and citrus. It is made in Korea so I guess they use Asian flowers. The fragrance is subtle and not overpowering. It is light and not greasy. My skin did not complain, no irritation, no tingling sensation, and it just felt relaxed. This would be good to use during summer when my face becomes oily, and breakout may occur due to clogged pores.",

It was over processed and shed. the hairs coming off at the actual bulb part, where they stitch it on to the cap and it was so thin towards the bottom I'm guessing because it was over processed while being colored. I have never left a bad review but after spending almost 200 dollars I figured I'd at least give someone the heads up before they go in on this wig. Blonde colored wigs are more expensive, I understand because they have to dye them, but this one just lost the entire mark. and just FYI the wig cap is biigggggggg.....I will not be returning it.

Remember you're not meant to tip you're head back anymore with stuff running down your face. The cup enables you to look down into the fluid, move your eyeball around in all directions, blink a few times, and you're done! I do not feel any stinging at all. Just cool relief. And it smells really good, too!  Which is kind of weird, but cool. :) I love the healthy ingredients.

Other teas and sleep formulations such as melatonin and valerian supplements just don't do the trick.<br />For me, it's more about the delightful taste. Slightly floral, slightly sweet. Yes, it does relax me and is helpful as part of a nighttime ritual, but not as much as my spouse. We both love it but for different reasons.<br /><br />And I just adore the look of the canister.

I probably should of put it on my kids a few times in the amount of time we were there but I had left it in the hotel room. I am very pleased with this product. It doesn't smell strong at all and once on the skin it doesn't feel heavy and make you feel sticky. It soaks in nicely!

I was perfect for me because I love makeup but wasn't sure I was going to love the whole &#34;contouring craze&#34;. So, I guess you would say it's a beginners kit, countour kits can get really expensive. It has six colors which are all very similar to the popular Anastasia contour kit but half the price. My skin runs fair to medium throughout the year so I can use 4 of the colors and the darker colors I just use for eye-shadow, usually in my crease as a blending color so nothing gets wasted. The banana color is great for brow bone highlighting. I love that the individual colors are magnetized and pop out so if you use a Z palatte (or a cheap dupe here; [[ASIN:B004SMPK6A ArtBin Sew-Lutions Slim Line Magnetic Box-Translucent Raspberry-6905AB]] you can pop whatever colors you use out and put in there instead of taking the whole palatte. It's nice to have the whole thing though because it has a nice big mirror. It also snaps closed so the lid isn't flopping around in your makeup bag and the powders getting gouged which I like a lot. I really have nothing but good things to say about this kit. If you are looking for high end cream makeup this isn't it but the colors blend nicely and look great so you will be the only one who knows you are using a cheaper brand!

My lips aren't wrinkled, but I can tell the formula pulls the skin together a little.<br /><br /> The color is bold. 06 Crush Berry appears to be a blue based red. Definitely red, like a classic red, just blue based rather than orange based. It feels super smooth on the lips, not at all tacky. Doesn't feel or look dry to start, but it dries down to a matte look. Can achieve a decent level of stain with a few applications and blotting.<br /><br />The first pass has a more oily look and feel to it. I smash my lips one way, and it appears to come off lips a little. Then I smash them in the other direction, and the color is there again. But once it sets, it isnt budging like that again. Any color disappearance is from drinking, eating.<br /><br />The case looks and feels good. The overall product is pretty good, just comes down to wanting a bold semi matte color that will perform like most other lipsticks- wears off with drinking & eating.Even then it doesnt disappear. Just might need to even out the color after awhile.  It seems to hold up to the product description. So for that (and all else), I give it a solid 4 stars.<br /><br />I'm not in love with it, but it looks nice in pictures. Has a bright pop of color. This is not a subdued look at all. I find that it nearly matches a bold lip tint that I like by \"I'm Meme\"<br /><br />https://www.amazon.com/dp/B091GSRN78/",

It was forming all around my mouth. I'm not going to complain about it. Just that's how it is now, and we have to work with it.<br />This serum seemed to be working at first. It's easy to apply using the dropper. Just squeeze a few drops on to the affected area and let it dry in.<br />You will notice when you use it that your skin appears to be tightening. Also with continued use the red marks on your face will lighten and eventually fade.<br />I had to stop using it. I believe it was working at first but after some continued use it was making things worse and the acne was spreading. I have a slightly oily skin type and this may not have been best suited to me.<br />Glad I tried it and I have a feeling that it may work better for a different skin type than mine.\"<br /><br />There you have it.

I really really wish the other end had been retractable too as bigger brush tips are a pain in the neck to recap.

I bought another two last summer and two more just recently.

I even wrote an email to Auric Blends politely voicing concern. I understand perfume ingredients must be expensive, but &#34;watering down&#34; perfumes with carrier oil to make the batch more cost efficient is compromising the product. I, and I believe many of my fellow Auric Blends fans will agree, would be fine with a small price increase if it meant the perfumes could be concentrated again. I sincerely mean that, because I like this company.<br /><br />The latest two I purchased are Sandalwood and Divine Opium. Sandalwood is woody and sweet.

The oil is initially applied with dry hands on your dry face, but you add water to your skin and that emulsifies the oil and makes it look and feel pretty much like soap. This cleanser leaves no residual oil on my face at all.  In fact, it actually leaves my face a little dry as compared to my usual cleanser.  Also, while it removes most of my mascara, I still need to use my Lanc√¥me eye makeup remover to get rid of the last traces of non-waterproof mascara under my eyes.<br /><br />This cleansing oil comes in a nice bottle with a pump that works well. It doesn't cause me any rash or irritation. This does have fragrance, but even though I can get headaches or allergic reactions to fragrance this one doesn't bother me. I think this is a nice cleansing oil that will work well for most skin types- except I wouldn't really recommend it if you have dry skin like me.

            "question": "title: A superb brace in all regards\ntext: I bought this brace after a fall in which I'd injured my knee, as well as my ankle, and needed to keep my knee completely immobile -- no lateral tuning or twisting at all, and restricted flexing and extension.  It was the third brace I ordered -- the first was not nearly strong enough, and the second sizing was off. I'm so glad I found this one: It's a superb brace -- fine, sturdy stays,plus hinges that let you adjust both flexion and extension. I initially thought that latter feature was something I wouldn't need, but it turns out to have made a huge difference during this first month of healing. (Needless to say, I could not have handled a sleeve-type brace -- the open front/wrap style was mandatory, and made my life so much easier.)  I've been wearing the brace 24/7 -- night as well as day --  for more than a month and it's been my saving grace.  Service has been superb, too: Before I ordered, I measured my thigh, knee and calf; I was on the cusp between sizes, and so ordered up. That seemed like a good idea at the time because it allowed me to wear the brace over my slacks, as well as under -- but after almost a month of continuous wear. the thigh (which was a little larger than I needed to begin with) seemed to have stretched out; I couldn't wrap the upper portion tightly enough and even with the straps cinched tightly, the brace slipped after an hour or two or wear. I wrote the seller and asked if there was a solution -- this brace was costly enough that I didn't want to have to pay out of pocket for a second one -- and they offered to send  me a smaller size. It arrived within a few days, accompanied by a label for free return of the first.  I couldn't have been more impressed or more grateful. I'd recommend this brace, and this seller, to anyone.",

This bronzer had some surprises to it.  Read on..<br /><br />PHOTO- My photo has swatches of both color 1 and 2 which are labeled.  I tried to get accurate photos colorwise and it is hard to do as the camera does not capture the nuances.  When applied with a brush, the effect is MUCH lighter.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />COMPACT<br />The compact is a high layered cardboard with a strong hinge to it.  There is no mirror and the pan inside has the product with designs pressed into it.  It does not come with a brush.<br /><br />WHAT IS THE COLOR LIKE?<br />This color is more of a bronze gold color.  It is still on the cooler side, but light warmer skin tones could use this too.<br /><br />TYPE OF SKIN TESTED ON?<br />This was tested on both MAC translation of skin tones NW 25 (which is what you see in the photos) and NC37 which is a more tan but cooler skin tone.<br /><br />HOW TO APPLY?<br />This applies well but you have to be sure you find the right brush.  A stippling brush was the best way to get a natural look from this bronzer and highlighter.  It allows for subtle application so that it does not look like you have on too much.  If you use too dense of a brush, it is easy to get a stripe of glow on your face that others will see and it can really look odd.  You also need to get a fresh brush and blend it very well into your skin.  Apply this in the backwards 3 figure on each side of your face.  Imagine two 3s in a mirror image on your face with the tips and centers touching.<br /><br />ANY OTHER USES?<br />I found that this also makes a fabulous eye shadow.  I found it to be a perfect match with the other color in this series of number 2 which is a darker more rose brown color.  This is a great companion to that.  If this is all you have, It also makes a great eye shadow alone or with another lighter satin finish shadow or even a matte.  I would not go super frosty.<br /><br />HOW TO APPLY TO EYES<br />In terms of eyes, you can use this as a contour, all over color, or in combination with the other darker color of this Sungasm series or another set of shadows.  The application is best for a lighter look to use a teardrop shaped brush.  Then for a heavier look with more color, a flat eye shadow brush packing this gently into place over a good eye primer is the way to go.  For a quick application, you can also use a finger to apply and blend it with a brush or your finger<br /><br />ANY IRRITATION PROBLEMS?<br />I am VERY sensitive and did not have any problems with this product on the face or eyes.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />As long as you are willing to take some time to find the right brush for the application of this, this bronzer is a pretty color especially for cooler toned skin.  It is a good highlighter for darker skin tones as a highlighter, though.  This is beautiful on the face, eyes, and in tandem with the other color of this bronzer too.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This is a nice bronzer and I am surprised at how well it works on cooler skin tones, something that is not all that easy to find, especially in TWO colors of a collections.",

I will say that the paper backings don‚Äôt peel off smoothly every time, and the fabric has a slight tendency to wrinkle and ripple, so the covers don‚Äôt stay completely flat throughout the entire duration of wear. The rippled texture is still somewhat visible under t-shirts, the edges are slightly detectable, and I think I‚Äôd have to layer two of them together to really ensure full coverage.

If I use it when my hair is wet, the scent dries with my hair and is light and airy. I'll probably switch back to the lavender scent after I finish this bottle.",

Another plus is that the  straight leg is sufficiently longer than the curvy one to make one-handed opening easy.  I know that sounds silly but people trying to put their hair up alone will appreciate what I mean.  The pins also come in a handy plastic cup instead of a thin piece of useless cardboard.  I appreciated that as well.  I know it is strange to write such a glowing review about bobby pins but I have had a difficult time finding truly silver ones plus ones that also are easy to open.

I wasn't around to when they were selecting reviewers for their conditioner but now that it's available for purchase I'm glade to say I've bought it for full sale price being 20 USD.  Like it's shampoo counterpart the bottle is 28oz total.<br /><br />Texture: White and creamy<br />Scent: Pleasant and definitely not reeking of tea tree oil like it's shampoo sister<br />Slip: Slip is a product's ability to allow one to detangle hair effectively and not need to use too much product to do so. For the amount I used which is pretty standard across the board with all conditioners I've tried, this conditioner is rated at 5/5 for slip<br />Moisture: Next to none but that isn't a real issue due to most of the oils being found in Keeva's tea tree oil shampoo<br />Standout Ingredients: hydrolyzed keratin ( protein ), argania spinose ( Moroccan argon oil ), cetearyl alchol ( fatty alcohol )<br /><br />Cons:<br />Cocos nucifera ( Coconut Oil ) isn't listed as an ingredient, however it is featured as an ingredient on the front of the bottle.<br />Melaleuca alternifolia ( Tea Tree Oil ) isn't listed as an ingredient either.<br />Both of these oils is on the front of the bottle being featured however, the product doesn't list the oils as ingredients.<br /><br />Overall, I believe this to be a quality conditioner even better than some brands found in salons. Price of the bottle is reasonable for the quantity received. This conditioner does provide one with good slip and it doesn't leave hair feeling heavy or weighted down after rinsing. I feel that when used with it's sister shampoo, you'll benefit from this conditioner most .",

This is the first sheet mask where I actually felt my face responding to it in a good way. It smelled just like citrus without it being too overpowering, nor was the tingly sensation, it told me that it was working! I also liked how this wasn't dripping with ampoule, it had the perfect amount to soak the face without it making a mess on your countertop or where the stuff would be rolling down your face and to your chest or creeping towards your eyes. So that in turn made wearing this more relaxing and not so irritating and awkward like most if not all the other sheet masks I tried. I almost didn't want to remove it, that's how much I enjoyed and loved it! I couldn't believe how baby soft smooth my skin was after using it. It wasn't a life-changer or game-changer for my hyperpigmentation, but it's unrealistic and next to impossible for any product to do that after only one use. My skin loved this though, I can tell that this is perfect for my skin type (combination/oily acne prone skin). I thought I'd swore off sheet masks. Granted, I'm still not blown away by sheet masks in general, this mask hasn't made me a fan of them, BUT...I'd totally buy this again. It was awesome.",

            "question": "title: Stunning, Beautiful, Adjustable Wig For Costume Or Play\ntext: Kids Size Long Wavy Halloween Wig (for 4-12 years old) is a stunning, beautiful wig for costume or play. This wig immediately reminded me of Sleeping Beauty‚Äôs gorgeous long curls and color. These curls are absolutely divine in both the ends and bangs. Truly a magnificent princess wig. There are elastic bands at the back of the wig to make it fit any size head. It will fit a small to large head with these clip elastic adjustments. Should the wig be too large for a really young, small child, you can always stitch it closer in the back on the inside. A couple stitches has made any wig tighter, and you can always remove the stitches for a larger child. However, I found the elastic straps hook really tight or looser, so I didn‚Äôt have a need for that. The curls are layered for a stunning effect. I love the bangs having those same large curls for a true princess look. The color is a light and gold blonde mix- just gorgeous. This is one beautiful wig for play or costume. 5 STARS.",

            "question": "title: weightless, non tacky, fully absorbs quickly, NO added fragrance, no scent\ntext: I have Rosacea, specifically type 1 where I experience redness from flushing and visible veins (telangiectasias). Otherwise clear skin. While topicals won't really help the veins, I can use products that help even out skin tone where it is pink from flushing. Some products can initially make my skin red, then it calms down (especially if new). This ISNTREE Cica Relief Ampoule Duo Set has not irritated my skin. In fact, it has helped to minimize aggravated skin.<br /><br />The serum is extremely light. I think the lightest weight product I have ever used. The bottles are small, and I feel like I am going through it quickly. I may be using too much, I dont know. I  do apply to neck and chest as well as face. I already use a product with EGF (epidermal growth factor), and I thought that maybe in serum form it would feel like a more concentrated dose. I have no idea how much Isntree uses, but this product feels like the emphasis is on the Centella Asiatica Extract. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, I am just not sure yet what I think about the performance of this product for my skin.  The two small bottles would be better as 1 bottle.<br /><br />--super light weight<br />--absorbs instantly<br />--not tacky<br />--skin feels instantly smooth (I also use some on the back of my hands)<br />--I wouldn't use it alone as a moisturizer, especially if have dry skin (like me)<br />--gentle, doesn't aggravate my skin, but that very well could differ for everyone (esp those w/ damaged skin barrier)<br />--contains soothing centella asiatica extract<br />--contains EGF- worth doing some research to see the benefits and to discount myths.<br />--ingredients that can help build and maintain skin barrier. Especially important for those with skin conditions where they are exacerbated by a damaged skin barrier. Got super sensitive skin? work on repairing that skin barrier before anything else.<br />--NO added fragrance in ingredient list. No naturally occurring scent either. I cant detect any aroma.<br /><br />My skin: mid 40s, smooth and clear (except for visible veins), leans dry. I follow this up with a moisturizing SPF (their sunscreens are great) or a moisturizer if using at night.<br /><br />I dont think it is bad. I really just think it is ok. I would give it 3.5 stars if I could. For me it isn't quite a 4 star product, so I am going with the middle of the road rating of 3. Your experience will vary. I think it would be especially appealing to those who prefer a weightless non tacky Centella Asiatica product. While I have zero issues with this, I am not likely to repurchase it. I have preferred products, especially for EGFs. However, if I notice anything else-- good or bad, I will be sure to update. It can take at least 2 weeks for a product to show its effectiveness, and it can take that long for the skin to acclimate to a new product. I am a little early on writing this, but my skin is used to centella asiatica as well as EGFs, and with some Isntree products.",

I use them to make my own essential oil (EO) bug sprays, after sun sprays, room refreshers, etc. They are small, spray well & don't leak.<br /><br />The small size is great for portability. I take one of my bug spray formulas outside with me for while I work on my farm. Because I only use EO's the effectiveness wears off much faster than synthetic products. I keep the bottle on me to respray as needed. I have a bottle in my purse with a germ fighting blend for when stores are out of the cart wipes. I even made up a bottle of toilet spray. I use peppermint EO for that.<br /><br />The funnel has a very narrow spout making pouring a slow processes but it keeps me from accidentally over filling the bottles. The tube that goes into the bottle is plenty long. It actually curls up in a C on the very bottom of the bottle. You can cut it if you want, but I leave it as is, I think they function better with the long tube. The stickers are a bit of a joke. I can't really fit \"Bug Spray\" on one tiny label. I'd have to write \"BS\" so I write \"Bug\" instead or \"Sun\" for example. It just barely fits.<br /><br />Overall, great little spray bottles that suit my farm girl needs.",

The next night, I use the Vitamin c with AHA and the Hyaluronic acid serums along with this one. I do wait about 10-15 minuites between each. But, I use the eye gel every night. They all work so well together and my skin is looking and feeling so much better. My biggest problems are large pores and uneven texture. My texture has evened out so much and my pores are surprising me more each day. I'd say these serums really have made the biggest difference in my pores. I kept seeing my grandmother's nose in the mirror, and I'm only 46--I was really self conscious. I'm starting to like looking in the mirror now...I'm seeing pretty quick changes and I like them.",

I have used it for 4 days now and can see a huge improvment in my skin- I have lready started ordering the full size products and not sure if I will ever use the obagi or not now- after using the obagi my skin was dry, peeling and I was getting lots of balckheads - after using eminece for just a few days- all blackheads are gone- my skin is softer than it has ever been and has a helthy glow -",

I the bottle, the smell of the lotion is horrible - I found it to have a strong, artificial scent similar to alcoholic spirits.  I decided to give it a try so that I could write an accurate review.  The \"lotion\" is quite thin, much more watery than any other moisturizer I have used.  Just to spread on my elbows requires at least 10 pumps from the tiny bottle.  The good news is that once on the skin, the distasteful fragrance does not last; I didn't really detect much scent at all after that, but there may have been a faint hint of rose in the dry-down.  The moisturization was adequate, nothing more.<br /><br />I do like the Nail & Cuticle Oil, which comes in a little roller bottle and actually DOES have a rose scent.  But this set is absolutely NOT worth the cost, especially given that the lotion is likely to be completely gone after just a few weeks of daily use.  Not recommended.<br /><br />NOTE:  At least one other reviewer (\"Jam Blaster\") mentioned the same issue with the lotion smelling bad and gave this product just 1-star as a result.<br /><br />UPDATE, 2/1/21:<br />Since I don't like the scent of this product, I decided to try it on my feet.  Despite the lotion being very thin, I actually found it to work quite well on my feet!  I put it on in the a.m., then put on socks; by the end of the day, my feet definitely felt soften and smoother.  I think the product is too expensive to purchase for this reason alone, but it does work, and so I increased my rating to 3-star.",

I find that this has light natural coverage using a foundation brush. It tones down my redness with ease. It can be built up, especially if allowed to semi dry between applications. I really like that it has SPF (PA++++) 50. I always use sunscreen, so adding this on top of my sunscreen base is just added protection. Also perfect for reapplication & touch ups through day.<br /><br />I also find that it is hydrating on my dry skin. Has a dewy finish. My natural skin comes through but looks better- more spruced up and put together looking. I do notice that the finish depends on what I use before hand. When I have used this on bare skin, it has a more mattifying appearance. When I use on top of my moisturizer and/or moisturizing sunscreen, then it has a more dewy radiant look. I prefer the latter.<br /><br />Seems to stay in place. I applied some to my forearm, and it is still in place a couple hours later.

I‚Äôm constantly putting lotion on my hands, especially during the winter, and keep travel size lotions everywhere.  This lotion comes in the perfect size for my bag, my desk, the night stand, and the car.  The lotion itself has a lovely lavender scent.  It‚Äôs not artificial or overwhelming like perfume, but smells botanical, like real lavender.  The lotion has a medium consistency and quickly absorbs, leaving a slight, non-greasy shine on my hands that makes them look less dry.  The scent fades quickly, but my hands feel soft and moisturized for hours...love it!  And, each lotion comes in an unbranded gift box, making them very giftable!",

It comes in a squeeze tube which makes it easy to dispense how much of it you need. They tell you to apply it liberally to your clean skin. When you do that you will notice that fantastic fragrance this has which is great since you will have this on your face for 15 to 20 minutes or so.<br /><br />During that time it will dry out and harden. Once the time is up rinse it warm water. I prefer to do these masks before I go into the shower so I can just rinse them when I am in the shower, so much easier and less of a mess if you ask me.<br /><br />Once you are done you will notice that your skin eels actually nice and soft. A lot of these clay masks tend to dry up your skin but I was impressed that this one did not. It actually felt almost moisturized but I still followed it up with a nice moisturizer right after I was done like I always do.<br /><br />I have to say this clay mask is great. It smells fantastic, is nice and gentle and does not dry you out. There are not a lot of clay masks out there that I do like because most dry my skin out but this one is fantastic.",

I can't really do anything when these are on my hands, but they feel nice and I like relaxing with them. Also, the black heart on the outside actually turns red when the wax gets really hot. I used mine in the microwave, and it worked really well.<br /><br />They have a unique design, which is basically a plastic hand wrapper that has a spongy interior, and the sponge holds all of the paraffin wax so that it delivers it right to your hands. It also stays hot for a pretty long time, which surprised me that all the heat didn't dissipate really quickly.<br /><br />These are made for average hands, so if your hands are giant, then these might be hard to fit into. But, they should work pretty well for most hands. Also, they're great for the first treatment, but for subsequent treatments, it's really tough to keep the wax in the sleeve while microwaving.<br /><br />But, overall, they're awesome for disposable paraffin treatments.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Makes your hands feel silky smooth<br />+The spongy interior absorbs and holds most of the wax<br />+The heat indicator really works<br /><br />Cons:<br />-May not last a full five treatments<br /><br />*TGN gave me this wax to review*",

I keep the patches in the fridge-I get better results when they're cold and it feels good as well.  I wear the patches in the morning for about 15 minutes and I'm good to go.  It did take multiple uses before the results were obvious but that's to be expected.  I like many of the ingredients in the patches, including: collagen, hyaluronic acid (HUGE fan!), and aloe, to name a few.  I'm not a  fan of the roller, unfortunately.  I just do not care for the way it feels on skin...its not smooth and gentle, more like tugging and pulling.  I will be passing it along to my mom who is anxious to try it.<br /><br />While I'm not a fan of the roller, I am a fan of the patches and am pleased with the results they provide.

My nose picks it up very well and it is gorgeous - I will layer my weaker YSL fragrances with it but I will also wear it alone because I like it that much!  To me it is definitely a masculine scent, and I agree w/ others - it probably depends on your skin chemistry with this, which to me is a unique bonus - because that makes it a different scent on every person.

            "question": "title: Purchased this item in Marshall's for $6.99\ntext: So as I have stated in previous skin care  product reviews, I am EXTREMELY vain. That is probably due to the fact that I suffer with Adult Acne. Never had acne until I reached my mid 20's. So as a fair skin woman in her mid 30's my focus is to lessen the severity of my outbreaks, and to keep my skin looking youthful and CLEAR! Like other women in my predicament I have spend loads of money on what seems like millions of products sometimes they work, then after a couple of months they cease to have any effect. So besides incorporating multivitamins into my life (B complex, Flaxseed oil, MSM, DMAE, etc) which I take pretty consistently, I drink plenty of water or as much as I can take, eat fairly healthy (no soda, no juice, no candy, no chips, little to no fast food) and of course I exercise. All these things will play into how healthy your skin will and can be! So on a recent trip to South Carolina, I ran into a Marshall's and I always check out the skincare section. Now within the last couple of months my skin will begin to clear up completely then BAM I will get a medium red nodule, or inflamed whitehead.... UGH! And though you are not suppose too I always pop mine to relieve the pain and pressure. I always do it with clean hands, and typical wash my face with my 10% sulfur soap I purchased here on Amazon. So when I ran into this Brightening product for $6.99 it caught my eye. With all the sulfur and scrubs and acne drying products my skin was looking pretty dull and kinda flaky. I needed something to help diminish my acne scars, moisturize and smooth out my skin... and the fact that this product claimed to help with anti aging was the icing on the cake... so I took it home and gave it a whirl.... its been about 2 1/2 weeks I have used this product 2x a day each day as it is not heavy and provides the extra moisture I need. I have noticed significant difference in the color and size of my scars. my skin feels smooth and soft. I feel good about this product sofar I have had no adverse reactions to this serum. With any product it takes a keen eye and diligence to becoming successful in your skincare goals. I will see how I feel about this product once I finish the bottle. If this product continues to show me positive gradual results I might purchase another product as this is cheap and effective. As we head into a new year I am looking to go more organic in my skincare products and spend alil less than I have this year and previous years.",

            "question": "title: All natural Luxury\ntext: I have never used a bath bomb, mostly I have used bath salts and made my own bath treatments, but had heard so much about bath bombs that I wanted to try them out for myself. I use essential oils so this one looked especially good to me. There are no funky ingredients or chemicals in it, so that was a huge plus for me. Each of the bath bombs has a name and what it is for. My favorite right off the bat was the grapefruit for energy. I was having a tired day and needed a pick me up, so I took a hot bath with one.<br /><br />The bath bomb took a while to dissolve, so it lasted quite a while, then the water turned lightly colored. It was nice to feel on my toes as it dissolved. The smell was lovely, however it didn't last too long. On the next one I used I just dropped a few drops of essential oils that matched the scent, so it helped it stay scented longer.<br /><br />All in all it is a lovely luxury to pamper yourself or give as a gift.<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT (IN ORDER TO TRY IT AND REVIEW) THIS DOES NOT GUARANTEE A GOOD REVIEW OR CHANGE MY OPINION ON THE PRODUCT, I AM HONEST AND UNBIASED, ALL OPINIONS ON IT ARE MY OWN AND BASED ON THE PRODUCT ITSELF.

            "question": "title: Love these paper sheet masks, but pricier than others\ntext: These are pricier than other compressed facial masks, but they have the advantage of prime shipping (as opposed to 2-3 weeks for international shipping) and of being individually wrapped. I wanted to try making my own masks asap, and also want to take these when I travel and to throw in beauty gifts (spa in a jar) for friends and family. So the fast shipping and individually wrapped masks were worth paying more for me.<br /><br />I love the concept of soaking these in whatever you like, or placing over a mud mask so that my skin can soak up the benefits and detoxify without drying out too fast. However, these are a bit too small for me width-wise and definitely too small for my hubby (who is willing to sheet mask with me!).  I'll probably buy these again just because I can easily travel with them and use in gifts, but I am going to look for larger ones that I can use on a more regular basis. And once you see the difference sheet masking can do for your skin, you might just look forward to using these as often as you can! I know I do!<br /><br />(I found a really good recipe to brighten and moisturize the face: one egg white, teaspoon of honey, and the juice of a lemon/lime slice. Whisk it together, or shake in a jar, and dab all over your face. Then soak your mask in it and place on your face. It feels sooo good! And is cheap :)",

            "question": "title: Performance Just Like the Dentist Office BUT for ~ $140 on Sale now\ntext: We tried several home teeth whitening kits and most gave marginal results.  But this kit, performs just the same as what you get at the Dentist.  Look at the picture I posted.  Its the teeth color card. Out of 1 - 20, my wife started with 14 top and 11 bottom. She drank a lot of coffee, red wine, etc...We tried this kit and got her down to 4 top and 2 bottom. Her teeth are just as white as the dentist office whitening service.  Here is what separates this kit from others: 1) Performance is second to none, 2) You get most of the whitening results the first application which is 8 minutes.  Remember with this kit, you have to do 4 sets of 8 minutes per day.  Meaning a total of 32 minutes total per day.  Getting most of the whitening in the first 8 minutes is amazing results 3) It only takes 5 days and 2.5 vials total out of the 10 vials that comes with the kit.  Meaning she can maintain her whiteness for the next 4 months without spending more. The procedure costs ~$400 at the dentist. You pay ~$140 - $150 for this kit for the same fast results and can maintain it for 4 months, depending on your teeth.  Meaning out of all of the teeth whitening solutions available, this one ends up being the MOST COST EFFECTIVE with guaranteed results.  Meaning if your teeth were able to whiten before, you should get the same whitening again.  My teeth can't be whitened because how they developed before my permanent teeth came out. I had a high fever so my teeth are a little yellow as a result and can't be whitened much even at the dentist.  At any rate, this is the real thing and you keep the blue light system and battery pack.  Just buy more vials later when you run out.  Enjoy!",

            "question": "title: It's not what I thought it would be\ntext: I gave this 3 stars for \"Softness\" because the brush is average to a bit firmer than what would be ideal and comfortable to use on your back, while the loofah strap is average.  The brush bristles are kind of scratchy and not the \"good exfoliating\" kind of scratchy.  They're more like the \"ouch, that's scratching me\" kind of scratchy.  Overall, though, it's acceptable and average.<br /><br />Next, I gave this 2 stars for \"Easy to use\" because I don't find this easy to use.  The brush is separate from the stick that extends it to reach your back; you slide the oval-shaped brush onto the stick by inserting the stick into a cut out section on the back side brush.  The problem here is that it doesn't stay on firmly at all.  I ended up with 2 options:  either not on firmly enough, so it kept popping off, or pushed on so much that it's very difficult to get off of the stick to use separately.  The loofah strap is really easy to use, though.  It's nice and long so there's plenty of length to comfortably hold each end and move it back and forth at most angles, no matter how thin or thick your arms or body may be.  That's a real plus!  But I still couldn't give more stars if only half of the set is easily usable.<br /><br />Finally, I gave this 4 stars for sturdiness because there's no doubt, it seems pretty sturdy.  The bristles on the brush have stayed intact.  The loofah strap is firm and sewn solidly -- but it may be too firm.  It's hard to get flexibility out of it.  The elastic strap handle on the brush is flimsy, but overall, it's a solid set.  The wood is a good, solid, well-finished wood without splits or cracks.  It doesn't seem like a cheap product that's going to warp and break easily if you keep it away from hanging to be soaked when it's not needed for use.  Putting it somewhere nearby where it stays dry is best.",

My favorite feature of this 6 piece cream eye shadow is that it stays put even when I am sweating. Instead of streaking down my cheeks or blotching in the creases of my eyelids, it really stays on where it is supposed to, especially if I use an eyeshadow primer. The colors are lovely, neutral hues that most people will find complementary to  their skin tone. I have a couple of their eye shadow sets, but this is the one that gets used the most.<br /><br />The pink set is softly feminine with lighter colors to accent daywear. They are perfect for cooler skin tones or as highlights on the eye for warmer tones.",

The suprising part is it's also replaced all eye creams I used to use. I put some on a Q tip and dab it around my eyes at night and the skin under my eyes is totally smooth and stays that way all day even under makeup. I'm 58 and as I say, I spare nothing to look my best including a great plastic surgeon so with that kind of money invested in my face I'm not going to skimp on moisturizer. The tube is designed so that cream Never backs up into the tube meaning the moisturizer is Always sterile, great if you've had a procedure or delicate skin. I do a home chemical peel every two weeks on my face, neck and chest every two weeks (ex sun worshiper) and this is the kind of cream that's perfect for the delicate after care of my skin. I also used it after having my whole face lasered at my plastic surgeons office too. I can't say enough about this and it was in all my Christmas stockings for my friends, male and female.<br />Oh, my skin is normal and not overly dry and even at my age I can break out with cystic acne, this did Not contribute to any break outs.",

            "question": "title: Good product\ntext: I took a risk by buying this since it didnt many reviews, but overall, I've had a good experience with it. Starting off with the packaging, it is well made, and it does bring many sheet masks you can pick up with some tweezers it brings. The masks in themselves are moist but not overly wet. That is, they will stick to your face (I've had these while walking around), but won't have product dripping down your neck. The solution is scented but not overly, and is not slimy as most masks, but will definitely tone/tighten your skin. I use these for 10min and they will remain there for that amount of time, but the edges will start to peel off after about 5 to 7min. I use these every other day. I would recommend these if you wanted to get the most masks out of your money, but honestly, I think there are better masks out there. That said, I will continue to use these.",

These are perfect for when you need a lot of them at one time like I did yesterday.

Although, anything that's supposed to take the skin off your body should probably cause some trepidation.  That being said, test a little on your skin ahead of time to make sure you're not allergic, it's just good practice with new products.<br /><br />When using, it works exactly as intended and as described.  You follow the directions, put them on as instructed, and let them sit awhile.  Then, you wash your feet off and do your thing for a few days.  After that, you will gross yourself out with your nasty feet as the skin falls off in large, small, etc. pieces.  It takes a few days, but at the end it got most of my callouses off and my feet did feel smoother.  Now to just keep working at it.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2021",
